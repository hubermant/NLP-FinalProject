[00:08] <Tiduz> lol
[00:08] <Lo-Volt> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCJxa97wp1I Patriots probably had to engage in espionage to get Light to do that.

[00:12] <TEEEPO> to save face
[00:13] <Tiduz> Troy Victorino, the ringleader behind the Florida Xbox murders, says that the trial that ended in a death sentence for him wasn't fair
[00:13] <Tiduz> wat
[00:13] * EviLoreTablet has joined #GA
[00:15] <Tiduz> Crave's excellent Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection will be getting a pair of high-definition ports this summer, apparently. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game just showed up at GameFly.
[00:17] <Tiduz> The website Killzone2.com, it turns out, isn't owned by Sony, but the websites Killzone and Killzone3 are, MTV Multiplayer reports in this look at domain name shenanigans.
[00:17] <Tiduz> wat
[00:17] <stump> Assigning that to Crave when they underprinted the Wii version and didn't advertise it is so silly. The devs made the game, Crave did nothing.
[00:18] <Jideo> who cares 
[00:18] <Jideo> @ kz2 domain
[00:18] <Tiduz> ic
[00:19] <Tiduz> is it even any good
[00:19] <Tiduz> the pinball game
[00:19] <Tiduz> also
[00:19] <Tiduz> why is sfiv dlc more expensive on 360 in japanland
[00:19] <Tiduz> o_O
[00:19] <Tre`> Yen/MS points shenanigans
[00:19] <stump> It's supposed to be good for a pinball game but I just couldn't give two shits about the genre so I have no idea.
[00:19] <Tre`> that's why MS points are BAD
[00:19] * Armitage has joined #GA
[00:20] <Jideo> it was supposed to make it simple 
[00:20] <Jideo> but all people end up doing is guessing
[00:20] <Tre`> anything that isn't direct 1:1 is automatically NOT simple
[00:21] * gloone has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[00:21] <Tiduz> new home features hm
[00:21] <Tiduz> A proverbial boatload of game spaces - including spaces for Warhawk, SOCOM, Resistance, and many, many more (we’ll announce more spaces in the coming weeks)...
[00:21] <Tre`> game spaces are dumb
[00:21] <Tre`> unless they have something there to do
[00:22] <thesoapster> .... http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=351290
[00:22] <Tiduz> ''We’re talking unlocking items in the games you play from Home (and vice versa), mini-games that take full advantage of the Sixaxis controller, game launching integration. The whole shebang!''
[00:22] <Tre`> and by something to do, I don't mean waiting in line to play bowling
[00:22] <osaka> Tre`: moar wallpapers!
[00:22] <Tiduz> SFIV gamespace will allow matchmaking
[00:22] <Tiduz> home not useless anymore?
[00:22] <Tre`> potentially not
[00:22] <Tre`> depends
[00:22] <Tre`> like what wasabi said
[00:22] <Tre`> a virtual arcade would be pretty hot
[00:22] <Tiduz> id use home if it had GOOD matchmaking
[00:22] <Tre`> especially if you could "put your quarter up"
[00:22] <osaka> http://eikka.blackmilk.fi/sf4/vega.jpg
[00:22] <Tre`> And spectating
[00:22] <Tiduz> yep agreed
[00:22] <osaka> http://eikka.blackmilk.fi/sf4/bison.jpg
[00:22] <Armitage> [14:22] <Tiduz> home not useless anymore? - no, still useless
[00:22] <Tre`> SF4 really needs spectating
[00:22] <osaka> http://eikka.blackmilk.fi/sf4/seth.jpg
[00:22] <Tre`> I dunno if it does or not
[00:22] <Tre`> but it needs it
[00:22] <osaka> done every character now
[00:22] <Kabouter> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=351295 < MrHicks is crazy
[00:23] <Tiduz> Armitage: but do you even like ps3
[00:23] <Diablos> home is a waste of hdd space
[00:23] <Diablos> especially if you have a 40gb
[00:23] <Tiduz> its optional
[00:23] <Tiduz> 40 gb lulz
[00:23] <Tre`> tiduz damage controlling PS3 again
[00:23] <Diablos> i know
[00:23] <Tiduz> HELL YEAH
[00:23] <Kabouter> He'd rather do a work-around every time he needs to type a colon than spend ten euros on a new fucking keyboard
[00:23] <Kabouter> Seriously
[00:23] <Diablos> that wasn't the point dickface
[00:23] <Kabouter> It's ten fucking euros

[00:39] * gloone has joined #GA
[00:39] <stump> daaaaamn THQ lost 200 million in the quarter.
[00:40] <OrinX> wat had tHq made lately
[00:40] <stump> OrinX: annual WWE game, Saints Row 2, de Blob were biggest games for the quarter

[00:42] <stump> and 50 Cent 2
[00:42] <OrinX> didnt most of those sell well
[00:42] <stump> Yeah everything sold well.
[00:42] <stump> $40 million of the 200 million loss is restructuring costs
[00:42] <stump> and they just shitcanned ~50% of their mobile division
[00:43] <stump> they also announced a $100 million cost savings plan
[00:43] <stump> and they haven't canned any projects recently, so I assume it's all cost controlling issues
[00:44] <bjork-wtf> baseball

[01:01] <Lo-Volt> I would have called you out sooner, but I was reconnecting a printer.
[01:01] <minty> haha
[01:01] <Lo-Volt> Lucky I didn't throw it at you through the internet.
[01:02] * EGM92_AnalRapist has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[01:02] <minty> having a bad day again?
[01:02] <Lo-Volt> No, I'm having a good day!
[01:02] <minty> that's good to hear
[01:02] <Lo-Volt> Had a day off because I needed to let a cable technician in.
[01:03] <Lo-Volt> New line, but same IP, heh.
[01:03] <Sea_Manky> whooo
[01:03] <Sea_Manky> man, that was a killer deadlift
[01:03] <Sea_Manky> still not sure of my form
[01:04] <Lo-Volt> OK, that's my Zune port.
[01:04] <Lo-Volt> So that's all the reconnecting I need to do with the PC, at least.
[01:04] * minty has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[01:04] <bjork-wtf> wait
[01:04] <bjork-wtf> who's a bitch
[01:04] <Lo-Volt> I do need one demerit, though, since I trudged this printer around to get it back and then I forgot to bring paper.
[01:04] <Lo-Volt> Not you.
[01:05] <bjork-wtf> oh, I know that
[01:05] <Sea_Manky> time for some baked wings and parmesan rice. :d
[01:05] <Lo-Volt> Kagari thinks the Shamwow/Look at this fucking candidate meme is stodgy.
[01:05] <bjork-wtf> well
[01:05] <bjork-wtf> she has a point
[01:05] <Lo-Volt> I think it still has some time.
[01:06] <bjork-wtf> she did say "getting"
[01:06] * bjork-wtf white knight
[01:06] * Lo-Volt shrugs.
[01:06] <Lo-Volt> Sorry, Kagari-.
[01:06] <bjork-wtf> it's cool, I mean, we can still have a hot 3-way :D~

[01:10] <Lo-Volt> The purge continues: THQ to lay off 600.
[01:10] <Lelielle> which is oatmeal and coconut plus chocolate binding
[01:10] <jakehk> wut
[01:10] <Sea_Manky> Orin: That stuff looks way too pliable to be part of mcdonald's nuggets
[01:10] <Lo-Volt> Though THQ isn't really in the best of shape as it is, so that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.

[01:11] <Tre`> omggggggggggggggggg
[01:11] <OrinX> chicken nuggets
[01:11] <Kagari-> ....
[01:11] <Kagari-> no way
[01:11] <Lelielle> http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/4787/shaveqj4.jpg -lol
[01:11] <OrinX> its to grind uo any bone.cartilage that may be in the chicken
[01:11] <jakehk> shin hair?
[01:11] <Sea_Manky> I simply don't believe those are what they make mcnuggets out of.  That stuff actually looks appetizing.
[01:11] <OrinX> up*
[01:12] <Kagari-> eeeeeeeew
[01:12] <WasabiKing> it's supposed to be chicken
[01:12] <OrinX> lol sea
[01:12] <jakehk> whats step 2
[01:12] <Sea_Manky> Orin: I'm not kidding.
[01:12] <GaimeGuy> Sea_Manky:  take a look at chicken before being cooked
[01:12] <WasabiKing> but they sometimes add pollock fish
[01:12] <Kagari-> where did you find this
[01:12] <Lo-Volt> Please welcome me to 1996, but DJ Shadow was great.
[01:12] <WasabiKing> which is awesome if you're allergic!
[01:13] <OrinX> step 2 is probably shaping them

[01:14] <Lo-Volt> Sorry, got thrown off the network when I flipped the WLAN switch...
[01:14] <Lo-Volt> ...
[01:14] <Lo-Volt> Oh, wow, do I have an admirer or something?
[01:14] <OrinX> In 1984, James Oliver Huberty killed 21 people and wounded 19 others at a McDonald's in San Ysidro, California, in what became known as the San Ysidro McDonald's massacre. Three years later, in 1987, his widow, Etna filed a USD$5 million lawsuit against McDonald's, claiming that the massacre was triggered by her husband's consumption of excessive amounts of Chicken McNuggets
[01:14] <jakehk> lol
[01:14] <OrinX> lawl
[01:14] <Lo-Volt> Back in 1984, that was a fair charge.
[01:15] <Lelielle> lol
[01:15] <jakehk> horse added to nba all star shit
[01:15] <Lo-Volt> Remember the gray McNuggets?
[01:15] <Lo-Volt> Who knew what that was.
[01:15] <Sea_Manky> wait, you have to actually kill people in order to justify suing McDonalds for their nuggets?  That ain't right.

[01:15] <osaka> http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/2900/dsc01753kt1.jpg
[01:15] <Lo-Volt> There were white, dry ones and gray, juicy but odd ones.
[01:15] <osaka> oh man
[01:15] <osaka> looks awesome
[01:15] <Lo-Volt> I wonder what the difference was...
[01:16] <OrinX> A meat slurry, reconstituted meat, or emulsified meat, is a liquefied meat product that contains fewer fats, pigments and less myoglobin than unprocessed dark meats. Meat slurry also eases the process of meat distribution and is more malleable than dark meats.
[01:16] <OrinX> Meat slurry is not designed to sell for general consumption; rather, it is used as a meat supplement in food products for humans, such as chicken nuggets, and food for domestic animals. Poultry is the most common meat slurry; however, beef and pork are also used.
[01:16] <Lo-Volt> Also, these PC speakers have surprising kick. Thanks, subwoofer.
[01:16] <Sea_Manky> osaka: Now make a cardboard backing that looks like the cabinet and try to pull a switcheroo
[01:16] <osaka> haha
[01:16] <osaka> i'm not getting a TE
[01:16] <osaka> my shitty skills don't deserve it
[01:16] <Lo-Volt> OrinX: GOD NO!
[01:16] <osaka> Tre` can confirm
[01:16] <Lo-Volt> WHAT.
[01:16] <WasabiKing> lol mcnugget eating rage
[01:16] <Sea_Manky> fewer fats?!?!
[01:16] <Sea_Manky> fuck that
[01:17] <Lo-Volt> Endtroducing is great.
[01:17] <OrinX> The meat is first finely ground and mixed with water. The mixture is then used in a centrifuge or with an emulsifier to separate the fats and myoglobin from the muscle. The product is then allowed to settle into three layers: meat, excess water, and fat.
[01:17] <OrinX> mmm
[01:17] <Lo-Volt> The 90s were better for muzak than I thought.

[01:23] <Lo-Volt> God, I like unions, but not the healthcare workers' union.
[01:23] <WasabiKing> coat it with flour and it's all good, manky
[01:23] <Sea_Manky> ywp
[01:23] <Lo-Volt> My TV: "Why are you cutting hospital budgets? WHY? WHY?"
[01:24] <Lo-Volt> Me: "Well, the state is broke?"
[01:24] <Sea_Manky> I'd still prefer the original form, but meat's meat and man's gotta eat
[01:24] <WasabiKing> I don't care about what it USED to look like
[01:24] <WasabiKing> I'm about what it looks like when I eat it
[01:24] <bjork-wtf> yeah
[01:24] <Sea_Manky> I just like the texture of the actual meat
[01:24] <bjork-wtf> like chicken nuggets shaped like dinosaurs
[01:24] <Lo-Volt> I just got Rooty too. I am so far behind you people.
[01:24] <Sea_Manky> But I don't know what McDonalds does
[01:24] <WasabiKing> yeah that's why I like wendy's
[01:24] <bjork-wtf> those taste better than regular nuggers
[01:24] <WasabiKing> and their #6
[01:25] <Lo-Volt> So who else is on the GAF muzak shitlist?
[01:25] <Lo-Volt> And can we add the Beastie Boys to it?
[01:25] <Sea_Manky> I assume they go through all that trouble, then toss out all the meat stuff and cut rubber doorstops up and batter them

[01:44] <TEEEPO> then he called me a sand nigger
[01:44] <TEEEPO> to prove some point

[02:04] <GaimeGuy> Lel:  even if I did change my name, it wouldn't make a difference, because people like osaka, wasabi, and av, who literally have spent HOURS looking up information about me, would never shut up
[02:04] <Takuan> when i was 10
[02:04] <DrForester> Osaka, D&D rulebok, jsut nintendo-y names to repalce D&D names

[02:05] <bjork-wtf> it's not like you're gonna lose face at this point
[02:05] <GaimeGuy> bjork: I tried that, it seriously just made things worse, actually
[02:06] <Takuan> well then, i stand in staunch defense of gaime's hobbies
[02:06] <Takuan> his nfaggotry is understandable

[02:08] <Takuan> not me.

[02:08] <Garrett> like 20~ dolalrs
[02:08] <Lelielle> heck is nice, we still have the saturn in the living room

[02:08] <Garrett> they are
[02:08] <bjork-wtf> I still have a purple PS2 saturn pad
[02:08] <Takuan> but i figured with the recent shortage in supply and SFIV rage, they'd have been marked up

[02:30] <Tiduz> what?
[02:30] <stump> Yeah.
[02:30] <Tiduz> mirrors edge on wii?

[02:32] <stump> Also interesting---the shittiest EA wii games sold the worst (Celebrity Sports Showdown, Ninja Reflex, Boogie Superstar, Facebreaker).
[02:32] <avcables_AREYOUKIDDING> to buy shit :(
[02:32] <Tiduz> i didnt find one either
[02:32] <stump> EA Playground is the only shitware they put out that actually sold well.

[02:33] <jman2050> wait
[02:33] <jman2050> how much did Madden sell in its first month?
[02:33] <Takuan> Tony_Parker: final score - 130 74
[02:34] <stump> jman2050: like 100k.
[02:34] <Tre`> I haven't gotten skate 2 yeat :(
[02:34] <jman2050> damn
[02:34] <jman2050> so it does have legs after all
[02:34] <stump> jman2050: 700k lifetime, which is shitty for madden but much much much less shitty than it could have been and much better than it did for gamecube last gen.
[02:35] <Tony_Parker> I think I was the only person that bought Madden 02 for GC
[02:35] <stump> hahaha
[02:35] <stump> there was an NBA game for GCN that had a 10k print run.
[02:35] <stump> It's the lowest print run non-LE game of last gen.
[02:35] <Tony_Parker> prop nba2k2
[02:35] <Tony_Parker> prob*
[02:35] <jman2050> I await the day people stop buying Roster Update 2010, but that will never happen

[02:35] <Tony_Parker> it was better on GC than DC

[02:36] <Tre`> wow
[02:36] <Tre`> battleforge has some very controversial design decisions (that are ultimately pretty smart)
[02:36] <osaka> oh mqn
[02:36] <Tre`> no balance changes after the game releases
[02:36] <osaka> man*
[02:37] <osaka> fringe is filled with my favorite tv actors
[02:37] <Tre`> which sounds awful at first glance
[02:37] <osaka> this is going to be good
[02:37] <Tre`> but, when you think about it
[02:37] <Tre`> balance changes would change the value of cards
[02:37] <Tre`> and people would throw a fit if they spent however the fuck much on one card, just for it to get nerfed
[02:37] <Tre`> some smart people in yurop
[02:37] <Diablos> lol
[02:37] <jman2050> Tre: no it's a terrible decision
[02:37] <Tre`> brilliant decision
[02:37] <jman2050> Because now they can't nickel and dime customers
[02:37] <jman2050> stupid developers
[02:38] <Tre`> they're already nickle and diming customers
[02:38] <Tre`> the game's got a TCG model :-p

[02:38] <jman2050> :P
[02:38] <Tre`> well
[02:38] <WolvesGuy> 2 dollars
[02:38] <Tre`> they're gonna release new cards
[02:38] <Tre`> to combat overly powerful ones
[02:38] <Tre`> or something

[02:44] <Tre`> lulz IGN
[02:44] <stump> jman2050: None currently. I'm just very good at rounding up leaks. There are no active leaks--there hasn't been in almost a year :/
[02:45] <Tre`> why would you even visit IGN for anything non-media related
[02:45] <jman2050> ah

[03:10] <Tre`> haha
[03:10] <JRPereira> are*
[03:10] <Tre`> you just want to play SF4, huh tak
[03:10] <Tre`> I can't really get into any games right now either
[03:10] <Tre`> all I can think about is ZOMG SF4
[03:10] <Lo-Volt> Capcom has really done nicely for itself keeping you fans with a hard-on for its software.
[03:10] <JRPereira> simulators don't count, so l4d and dead rising don't count as games
[03:10] <Lo-Volt> Deadrising, Street Fighter 4, etc.
[03:11] <Tre`> Capcom is like
[03:11] <Tre`> the only japanese developer worth a shit
[03:11] <Lo-Volt> It's true.
[03:11] <Lo-Volt> Square Enix is a tease, and Scamco Bombdai is... well, Scamco Bombdai.

[03:11] <JRPereira> dead rising covers romero zombies, and left 4 dead covers ..... 28 days later zombies?
[03:12] <JRPereira> there was a term for the faster ones and i don't remember it now
[03:12] <minty> hype for sf4 dying
[03:12] <minty> hype for mlb09 rising
[03:12] <Lo-Volt> Dead Space relies on good graphics as it is, so what will it be like on the Wii?
[03:12] <Lo-Volt> And fuck, sequel please?
[03:12] <EGM92_AnalRapist> LOL
[03:12] <Lo-Volt> What position does Matt Light play for the Patriots?
[03:12] <Jideo> i'm not too bothered about sf4 i think i'll pick it up a month later or something.. when all the noobs finish online

[03:13] <EGM92_AnalRapist> well you click on a vent and monster pops up, then you get a mini game of die rolling! to determine if your shots hit it or not
[03:13] <Tre`> jideo:  did you hear that SF4's getting a championship tournament mode for online?
[03:14] <Tre`> and you can upload those replays apparently
[03:14] <Kagari-> chris looks out of porportion
[03:14] <Tre`> if you do well in the tournament, that is

[03:14] <Lo-Volt> OK, keep that messy dude in mind, with his nasty beard and messy hair.
[03:14] <Tre`> apparently the article only mentioned challenge mode?  and the tournament
[03:14] <Tre`> and only if you place high
[03:14] <Tre`> still no word on whether there's replays in general
[03:15] <Tre`> I'd hope so
[03:15] <Tiduz> Even better
[03:15] <Kagari-> RE5 looks like shit
[03:15] <Tre`> no excuses for not having replays
[03:15] <Takuan> Tre`: DLC
[03:15] <Tiduz> jewtube support plz
[03:15] <Jideo> you can't save replays in the arcade 
[03:15] <Jideo> so i'm not surprised

[03:47] <Tiduz> it isnt?
[03:47] <Alone> Sea_Manky: the time machine disk and your hd?

[03:48] <Lo-Volt> That reminds me, I need to back some data up to my portable HDD...
[03:49] <Kagari> I didnt say mlb demo was on 360

[03:49] <osaka> Tiduz sucks ass
[03:49] <minty> asking for ban=instant perma ban
[03:49] <Kagari> maybe you mistook that
[03:49] <darkh23> not as bad as your flood of false information
[03:49] * Armitage has joined #GA
[03:49] <Lo-Volt> minty: is this policy?
[03:50] <Sea_Manky> no wait, apparently these are just hard links
[03:50] <osaka> backseat modding is a delicious cycle
[03:50] <Sea_Manky> Then how the hell did I manage to fill the fucker?
[03:50] <minty> lo: nah. 
[03:50] <Lo-Volt> Ah.
[03:50] <Lo-Volt> If this were GAF Government policy, I'd support it.
[03:50] <Tiduz> lol, as if i was serious
[03:50] <Tiduz> backseat modding lulz.
[03:50] <darkh23> sure back down now
[03:50] <osaka> i meant minty
[03:50] <osaka> you tard
[03:50] <Sea_Manky> ah, I get it
[03:50] <darkh23> once they get the pitchforks out
[03:51] <Tiduz> RAGE
[03:51] <Tony_Parker> are all Saturn controllers USB?
[03:51] <Unison> no
[03:51] <Sea_Manky> I moved a shitload of data into different folders the other day when I was cleaning out my downloads
[03:51] <Tony_Parker> k
[03:51] <Sea_Manky> so it all got backed up separately
[03:51] <Tony_Parker> i didn't want to dig up my saturn to check
[03:51] <IGotHimuroids> Can you check your bank balance on any type of ATM or can it only be owned  by your bank to see it?
[03:51] <Sea_Manky> they should take a page from subversion and fix that
[03:51] <bjork-SEGA> my saturn pad is for a ps2 port
[03:51] * MarkMan23 has quit IRC (Quit: )
[03:51] <Lo-Volt> Any ATM.
[03:51] <minty> any atm
[03:52] <Lo-Volt> They'd only charge you a fee if you withdrew from an ATM not in your bank's network.
[03:52] <osaka> wait
[03:52] <Alone> doesnt moving files only change their directory?
[03:52] <osaka> you have to pay a fee for ATM's in america?
[03:52] <osaka> what the fuck
[03:52] <Sea_Manky> osaka: haha yeah
[03:52] <IGotHimuroids> yeah osaka
[03:52] <IGotHimuroids> if it's not your bank you have to pay a fee
[03:52] <osaka> stupid ass country
[03:52] <IGotHimuroids> haha
[03:52] <IGotHimuroids> commie
[03:52] <IGotHimuroids> COMMMMMIEEEEEEE
[03:52] <Sea_Manky> When they started doing it years ago, I was expecting guillotines to be pulled out
[03:52] <Armitage> its like that in canada too in some cases
[03:52] <Sea_Manky> but no, we rolled over for it
[03:53] <Lo-Volt> I almost want to change banks because of it.
[03:53] <Lo-Volt> My bank doesn't have a branch near me.
[03:53] <Sea_Manky> keep adding on fees and fuckers will pay
[03:53] <Tiduz> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=14651179&postcount=1374
[03:53] <bjork-SEGA> 2 fees from my bank
[03:53] <Tiduz> korean sfiv player
[03:53] <Takuan>  lyre
[03:53] <osaka> i dont pay any other fees for my bank services other than my visa debit card monthly fee
[03:53] <Takuan> this is the guy who banned me
[03:53] <osaka> which is 1.50euros
[03:53] <minty> lots of boa branches in ma hood
[03:53] <bjork-SEGA> one to the ATM owner and one to the bank
[03:53] <Alone> osaka: debit /= credit card
[03:53] <osaka> i know
[03:53] <Tiduz> http://www.gametrailers.com/player/45105.html
[03:54] <Tiduz> bison vs seth
[03:54] <Tiduz> inktrailer
[03:54] <osaka> who said it's a credit card?
[03:54] <Sea_Manky> osaka: Oh, I'm sure we'll export that particular feature to you at some point.  It worked for subprime loans.
[03:54] <minty> isn't lyre another jappawaka mod
[03:54] <osaka> but fees for withdraws is just dumb
[03:54] <osaka> what if
[03:54] <osaka> you have 100 bucks on your account
[03:54] <Lo-Volt> This freaking portable HDD was corrupted again.
[03:54] <Lo-Volt> Geez.
[03:54] <osaka> and you want to withdraw 100 bucks from an ATM of not your bank
[03:54] <Tony_Parker> not happening
[03:55] <osaka> you can't?
[03:55] <Alone> then you get punished like the bitch you are :/
[03:55] <Sea_Manky> Then you get an overdraft, and your bank charges you a shitload of money as a fee
[03:55] <Lo-Volt> With fees, you'd run out of money.
[03:55] <Lo-Volt> So shitty, eh?
[03:55] <Tony_Parker> unless your bank and the atm bank don't take fees
[03:55] <Jideo> nn
[03:55] <Lo-Volt> We eat shit in this country, do we now.
[03:55] <Lo-Volt> Not.*

[03:55] <Tiduz> :o
[03:55] <osaka> Alone: shut up, and go bathe in vodka and dance kalinka or something
[03:56] <Alone> cant :(
[03:56] <Sea_Manky> See, banks _like_ it when you have an overdraft.  Then they can charge you an overdraft fee, and account handling fee, associated bookkeeping fees, and so on
[03:56] * Jideo has quit IRC (Quit: )
[03:56] <Sea_Manky> just like credit card companies like for you to miss payments

[03:56] <Sea_Manky> Extra fifty bux in their pocket
[03:56] <osaka> it's like paypal
[03:56] <osaka> but offline
[03:56] <Takuan> tiduz: what's the ryu trying to do following the f+fierce?
[03:56] * pj has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[03:56] <Takuan> is there a combo he's trying to go for
[03:57] <Tiduz> i havent watched it yet
[03:57] <Sea_Manky> more accurately, paypal is like banks, but online
[03:57] <Tiduz> need to go to bed
[03:57] <Takuan> oh
[03:57] <Tiduz> will watch tomorrow =p
[03:57] <Takuan> why'd you link it
[03:57] <Takuan> or was that tre
[03:57] <Tiduz> no was me
[03:57] * Tre` has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[03:57] <osaka> Sea_Manky: no, cos non-bullshit banks arent like paypal
[03:57] <OrinX> LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOST
[03:57] <Takuan> -_-
[03:57] <Takuan> oh shit lost
[03:57] <IGotHimuroids> LOS
[03:57] <IGotHimuroids> T
[03:57] <Sea_Manky> When I used one of my credit cards for the first time in years, they neglected to send me a statement for the next billing cycle.  HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
[03:57] <Lo-Volt> Oh.
[03:57] <Lo-Volt> That means it's time to watch MythBusters.
[03:58] <minty> welp, at least orinchan will be gone for a while
[03:58] <OrinX> nope
[03:58] <OrinX> gonna be OMG is here
[03:58] <OrinX> in*
[03:58] <Sea_Manky> osaka: I would like to meet one of these non-bullshit banks.  We don't have those.
[03:58] <Takuan> knight rider -_-
[03:58] <Takuan> who's the voice of kitt
[03:58] <osaka> Sea_Manky: welcome to europe!
[03:59] <Lo-Volt> Oh wow, GameFly bought Shacknews today.
[03:59] <Lo-Volt> Though if you're in a certain region, you'd be stupid not to use the dominant bank there.
[03:59] <Lo-Volt> Chase in New York, for example.
[03:59] <Lo-Volt> Unless the bank is teetering.
[04:00] <Takuan> oh wow
[04:00] <Takuan> Tiduz: ki just saw it
[04:00] <Unison> i use chase too Lo-Volt
[04:00] <Lo-Volt> You can trip over Chase ATMs and locations in New York.
[04:00] <Sea_Manky> osaka: Don't you people have crazy shit like universal health care and stuff?  I don't know if it's worth having banks that aren't trying to rape my ass if I have to get affordable medical care too.
[04:00] <Lo-Volt> I don't use Chase, though.
[04:00] <Takuan> oh fuck i forgot lost is on abc.
[04:00] <Takuan> yay only preview
[04:00] <Unison> :O
[04:01] <Lo-Volt> I should, but JPM Chase is chasing (ugh) bad money and I get uncomfortable with it.
[04:01] <Lo-Volt> Otherwise, I'd have moved my money already.
[04:01] <Lo-Volt> And Citi? LOL, HELL NO.
[04:01] <Lo-Volt> Citi of Death, that bank is.
[04:02] <Sea_Manky> I'd have cancelled my citibank cards ages ago if it weren't for the fact that if you do ANYTHING EVER, your credit score drops.
[04:02] <Lo-Volt> Even debit?
[04:02] <Lo-Volt> I know credit scores take a hit for CCs, but...
[04:03] <Sea_Manky> credit cards
[04:03] <Takuan> Kate's so troublesome.
[04:03] <Sea_Manky> I don't bank with them, I just have CCs with them
[04:03] <Lo-Volt> I really wanted to kill my credit card last year, but I was rightly talked out of it.
[04:03] <Lo-Volt> Don't ever bank with them.
[04:03] <Sea_Manky> Wasn't planning on it
[04:03] <Lo-Volt> That bank is going to hell on a rocket.
[04:03] <Sea_Manky> They're a holdover from college, when I had no idea
[04:03] <Lo-Volt> And will take my city with it when it goes. New Yawk am cry.
[04:03] <Takuan> oh fuck okff
[04:03] <Lo-Volt> The big Canadian banks seem stable, though.
[04:03] <Takuan> kate -_-
[04:03] <Lo-Volt> I use TD nowadays.
[04:04] <Takuan> really?
[04:04] <Takuan> sweet!
[04:04] <IGotHimuroids> KATE IS HOT
[04:04] <Takuan> go TD!
[04:04] <Takuan> KUNT
[04:04] <Lo-Volt> Speaking of :D or -_-, The Dark Knight. Holy shit!
[04:04] <Sea_Manky> I'm not worried about bank stability, as I have about three orders of magnitude less money in my account than the FDIC covers. :P
[04:04] <Lo-Volt> Saw it last night, and oh God.
[04:04] <Lo-Volt> Still, I don't want to wait for the FDIC to either go to Congress to bail IT out or wait for payout.
[04:04] <Lo-Volt> Doesn't that take a few weeks?
[04:05] <Lo-Volt> Chris Nolan and Co. pull no punches.
[04:05] * rkSLEP is now known as rkSICK
[04:05] <Lo-Volt> Kill em All, etc.
[04:05] <Lelielle> canada regulates the banks reasonably well so we missed the huge crunch, but being very connected to the us we still are having some serious slowdown
[04:05] <Lo-Volt> Great film, but also really traumatic.
[04:05] <Lo-Volt> TD bought Commerce Bank in the Northeast US and rechristened it.
[04:06] <Lelielle> there arent enough people in canada to market good to
[04:06] <Lo-Volt> To solve that problem, apparently.
[04:06] <Tiduz> http://www.gametrailers.com/player/45108.html
[04:06] <OrinX> LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTT
[04:06] <dead> shut the fuck up orin
[04:06] <Sea_Manky> If my bank went under, the worst that would happen is that my auto-pay bills would need to be not-auto-paid. :X
[04:06] <dead> :D
[04:06] <OrinX> lol
[04:06] <WasabiKing> lol owned
[04:06] <OrinX> cat did it
[04:06] <Takuan> Tiduz: why you linking shit
[04:06] <WasabiKing> dead never says shit like that
[04:06] <Lo-Volt> Which is fine.
[04:06] <Lelielle> I have thought about changing over to a credit union but the service at TD is really good
[04:07] <dead> A man has limits
[04:07] <Lo-Volt> But if Citi's good-bank-bad-bank attempt fails, New York City as a going concern becomes a bigger if.
[04:07] <dead> dont test me
[04:07] <Lo-Volt> City and the Citi seem tied too closely.
[04:07] <dead> I might go off like bale!
[04:07] <Lo-Volt> Citi employed a lot of people in Manhattan, and our tax agents would shit themselves if or when that stops.
[04:08] <Tiduz> Takuan: i like tekken and sf
[04:08] <Tiduz> sue me
[04:08] <Tiduz> :D~
[04:08] <Tiduz> anyways time for bed
[04:08] <Lo-Volt> TD seems fine with me.
[04:08] <Lo-Volt> I like them enough not to go to another bank.
[04:08] <Takuan> but why wouuld you link shit you haven't even watched yourself
[04:08] <Takuan> lame.
[04:08] <Takuan> Lo-Volt: TD :bow
[04:08] <Takuan> The People's Bank
[04:08] <Lo-Volt> Commerce Bank was allegedly a little crooked.
[04:09] <Takuan> CIBC?
[04:09] <Takuan> no.
[04:09] <Lo-Volt> No, Commerce Bank in America.
[04:09] <Lelielle> cibc SUCKS

[04:33] <thesoapster> sigh
[04:35] <thesoapster> how do i keep myself motivated to keep on working out? i think my main motivation comes from girls...as in me feeling that i have a chance with them. but i think i too often become discouraged/convince myself it's not a possibility. that and in my regular daily activities i have a more than adequate level of fitness 
[04:36] * CajoleJuice has joined #GA
[04:37] <Takuan> lol swayere
[04:37] <thesoapster> i guess...a more appropriate question would be: if you were once fat and had that hopeless feeling about getting a girl...did you have a boost in self-confidence from getting into better shape?
[04:37] <Tre`> soap:  yes.
[04:38] <Takuan> i think fat people still see themselves as fat even after the fact
[04:38] <Takuan> frail psyches total
[04:38] <Tre`> that's true too
[04:38] <thesoapster> i've always seen myself as fat
[04:38] <thesoapster> well, ever since the 2nd grade passed
[04:38] <minty> fatty
[04:38] <CajoleJuice> lol fatties
[04:38] <minty> haha

[04:40] <Tre`> Cajole:  I actually grew up fat and got thin towards the end of high school
[04:40] <Tre`> like
[04:40] <Tre`> 50 lbs weight loss
[04:40] <Takuan> ahuahua
[04:40] <CajoleJuice> would've been my guess
[04:40] <thesoapster> and i guess some people's definitions of fat differ
[04:40] <Takuan> for what it's worth
[04:40] <Takuan> i'm a fat person in a skinny person's body
[04:40] <Lelielle> I've always been average, kind of on the thin side now, but stress keeps me from eating 
[04:40] <Tre`> fuck yo metabolism

[04:44] <jakehk> wut qtr
[04:44] <Takuan> tre, loock 'n load
[04:44] <Tre`> It's nothing like COH at all, really
[04:44] <Lelielle> sometimes you nee to find whatever mental problems might be making you eat unhealthily too, hard to get healthy when youre stressed or whatever
[04:44] <Tre`> and if it was, that'd be a good thing
[04:44] <Kagari> this is what he said: Remember Company of Heroes?  It's that, except with 40k units.  And possibly even simpler, as there is even less emphasis on a base.
[04:44] <thesoapster> Lelielle: hmm.
[04:44] <Tre`> wait
[04:44] <Tre`> did he call COH simple?
[04:44] <Tre`> your friend is a retard
[04:44] <Tre`> stop talking to him
[04:44] <Kagari> lol
[04:45] <Tre`> tell him I said that
[04:45] <thesoapster> coh is simple?
[04:45] <thesoapster> bwahahaha
[04:45] <Kagari> I only played CoH once
[04:45] <Kagari> so I cant judge
[04:45] <Tre`> since when is base building what makes an RTS complex?
[04:45] <Tre`> gtfo
[04:45] <Kagari> Yeah.  I played as the Tyranids.  They have three buildings.  The Main HQ, where you make all of your units, a Turret (presumeably one of the three generals would be able to build more, I didn't use the support one) and then a support building I could create with a special power.  That was it.
[04:45] <Lelielle> I mean people are not fortresses of willpower
[04:45] <Kagari> D:
[04:45] <CajoleJuice> someone said CoH is simple
[04:45] <CajoleJuice> wtf

[04:46] <Tre`> DOW2 3v3 is not very fun
[04:47] <minty> no 2v2?
[04:47] <CajoleJuice> why?
[04:47] <Tre`> warcock keeps trying to get me to do 3v3 ranked matches with him and shit
[04:47] <Tre`> and it's bleh every time
[04:47] <Tre`> something about DOW2 just doesn't work in 3v3

[05:51] <olubode> er, it isn't?
[05:51] <Sea_Manky> south florida under a MY FIST warning
[05:51] <Tre`> it's just a rekka combo (with easier input) with a high low mix up and a throw at the end
[05:51] * Armitage has quit IRC (Quit: )
[05:52] <Tre`> it's like if you mixed fei long and sagat
[05:52] <Takuan> shin: JO almost a triple double with blocks :|
[05:52] <Takuan> nice to see him coming back into form
[05:52] <Shinobi_Arshavin> JO was a fucking beast
[05:52] <Tre`> actually, I also think there might've been some characters in SFEX who had combos that were like that and ended in a throw
[05:52] <olubode> Tre`: but neither of those characters end with a throw that tosses the opponents to the other side of the screen
[05:52] <Takuan> too bad we suck
[05:52] <Shinobi_Arshavin> I lol'd at the shit talking he did after one block
[05:52] <Shinobi_Arshavin> dude
[05:53] <Shinobi_Arshavin> the raptors were great tonioght
[05:53] <Shinobi_Arshavin> no calderon
[05:53] <Tre`> olubode:  eh, the throw is just decoration
[05:53] <Shinobi_Arshavin> bosh goes out
[05:53] <Takuan> yeah but we fuckin' lost
[05:53] <olubode> Tre`: thats why I said SF proper.
[05:53] <Tre`> it still results in a knockdown
[05:53] <Takuan> oh bosh went out too?
[05:53] <Nikashi> Fuck
[05:53] <Shinobi_Arshavin> second night of a back to back against a rested lakers

[05:53] <Takuan> well
[05:53] <Nikashi> by a Balrog
[05:53] <Nikashi> yay for 50% throws you can't escape :/
[05:53] <Shinobi_Arshavin> both teams were shooting the lights out
[05:53] <Tre`> I don't really consider it much different just because it ends in a throw.  The throw's just an animation
[05:53] <Takuan> joey g had another 20pt game
[05:53] <Sea_Manky> you can escape it
[05:53] <Takuan> juhjuhjuhjoey
[05:53] <Shinobi_Arshavin> joey was great
[05:54] <Shinobi_Arshavin> it was a fun game
[05:54] <Sea_Manky> I usually don't take more than three or four headbutts from a balrog
[05:54] <Shinobi_Arshavin> I stuck around at the bar to watch it
[05:54] <Shinobi_Arshavin> since of course this tsn2/rogers spat hasn't been resolved yet
[05:54] <Nikashi> Sea_Manky: I was wailing ont he buttons

[06:32] <Unison> Electronic Arts, in a staggering display of ineptitude not seen since it decided not to support the Dreamcast, managed to lose $641m in Q3 2008, despite releasing FIFA, Madden, Need for Speed, Spore, Rock Band and more last year.
[06:32] <Nikashi> jakehk: I think it was on Sega or somethign

[06:32] <Unison> how do you lose $650 million on games in ONE QUARTER!?!?
[06:33] <Tony_Parker> EA down the drain since Peter Moore jumped ship while Xbox beats PS3
[06:33] <Shinobi_Arshavin> you take nintendo out of the gaming industry
[06:33] <WasabiKing> the biggest thief in the NBA just checked in
[06:33] <Unison> they could have bought Rare twice!
[06:33] <Shinobi_Arshavin> and it could be a billion in the red

[06:33] <CajoleJuice> or whatever
[06:33] <Shinobi_Arshavin> the license for godfather 2?
[06:33] <Unison> like what is the budget on roster updates for Madden?
[06:33] <CajoleJuice> and then he askes me if its illegal
[06:34] <CajoleJuice> like what the fuck
[06:34] <Unison> i blame Mirror's Edge hahaha
[06:34] <nerbo> it fails to paint the bigger picture at how much dough EA has pulled in over the last few years

[06:34] <Shinobi_Arshavin> at least I can point to them making hardware as their excuse
[06:34] <nerbo> and also how much their stock value accounted for their purse
[06:34] <Nikashi> CajoleJuice: Sounds like you need to fuck with him
[06:34] <Shinobi_Arshavin> the fuck excuse does ea have?
[06:34] <CajoleJuice> give me ideas
[06:34] <Unison> it must be Spore
[06:34] <Nikashi> Shinobi_Arshavin: Buying a fucking office in downtown Vancouver
[06:34] <Nikashi> that they now have to SELL
[06:34] <Unison> that probably cost a billion dollars to make

[07:56] <Nikashi> My mom used to be a communications officer in the army
[07:56] <Tre`> took meat
[07:56] <Nikashi> so she did this total secure radio voice
[07:56] <Kagari> worst i did was help my brother ducktape my other brother and lock him in a room
[07:56] <Tre`> the aforementioned deep freezer incident
[07:56] <Nikashi> "You are on a secure channel, the police are coming"
[07:56] <Nikashi> I ran inside crying
[07:56] <Tre`> my sister did something to piss me off when I was like 12 or so
[07:56] <Nikashi> She says she doesn't remember that
[07:56] <Nikashi> SURE
[07:56] <KimiSleep> when was that
[07:56] <Nikashi> I STILL HAVE NIGHTMARES

[09:24] <HadesGigas> do nintendo have like any games coming developed by them themselves other than Wii Sports?
[09:24] <HadesGigas> And I guess the Pikmin/DKJB ports if you want to count those
[09:25] <SantaC> i am worried that all these gamecube ports this year will be nintendos 2009 wii games
[09:25] <SantaC> :(
[09:25] * Bob_Coffee is now known as Bob_CoffeeAway
[09:28] <HadesGigas> seriously though.. like all their upcoming announced games are developed by foreign branches of Nintendo or different companies all together
[09:29] <HadesGigas> unless you count ones that Miyamoto or Reggie has mentioned in passing in interviews like Pikmin, Zelda, and Mario, which are likely 2010 anyway
[09:29] <Kagari> heh

[10:26] <bjork-SEGA> HONOLULU - Even as Hawaii's economy spirals downward and the state's budget runs short, the state is having to pay island residents a $1 tax rebate.
[10:27] <mrsolo_> eh?
[10:27] * nerbo has quit IRC (Quit: )
[10:27] <bjork-SEGA> Hawaii's Constitution requires that the government pay residents when there's a surplus in the state budget, although that surplus has long since disappeared.

[10:27] <mrsolo_> fail
[10:28] <bjork-SEGA> the maui news is sad, there's only like 20 total job listings and like 0 houses for sale

[10:29] <mrsolo_> 0 houses for sale that is good
[10:29] <mrsolo_> at least real estate isn't tanking
[10:30] <bjork-SEGA> I think a lot of people just lost their vacation homes last year
[10:30] <bjork-SEGA> tons of short sale listings on the realtor sites, with "bank" listed as the owner
[10:30] <mrsolo_> those are forclosures
[10:31] <bjork-SEGA> some of them are pretty cheap
[10:31] <bjork-SEGA> well, cheap for over there, anyway
[10:31] <mrsolo_> well
[10:31] <mrsolo_> real estate is tanking all over the place

[14:18] <KimiSleep> heh that happens to me
[14:18] <KimiSleep> I usually play along and then try making them embarresed cuz they can't remember me
[14:18] <KimiSleep> You'd think -I'd- be embarresed
[14:19] <osaka> Today, I sneezed so hard I herniated my back. After passing out from the pain I awoke on the floor covered in my own shit and piss. Unable to move, I had to wait in this state for four hours for my wife to return home from work, clean me up and take me to the hospital. FML

[14:47] <KimiSleep> man I really dunno which download to choose.. I guess I'll keep it going for another hour or two and just take whichever got the furthest or something
[14:53] <osaka> spotify wins
[14:53] <osaka> started playing coolio - gangsta's paradise :D
[14:53] <osaka> havent heard this song in like 10 years
[15:02] <KimiSleep> goddddaaaamn
[15:02] <KimiSleep> it's too fucking hot
[15:02] <lee_n> it's snowing here, heh
[15:03] <KimiSleep> I'm shirtless with short pants
[15:03] <KimiSleep> nearly sweating
[15:03] <KimiSleep> fucking winter this is
[15:03] <KimiSleep> well my room is particularly hot but still
[15:03] <KimiSleep> shouldn't be 27c outside
[15:04] * EviLoreTablet has joined #GA
[15:04] <osaka> i need 27c outside
[15:04] <osaka> let's switch kimi
[15:04] <osaka> wanna have -6c?
[15:04] <KimiSleep> that might be too steep
[15:05] <KimiSleep> I don't think I ever experienced -6
[15:05] * Y2Kev has joined #GA
[15:05] <osaka> worst this year has been -20
[15:05] <KimiSleep> nahI probably have, just once
[15:05] <osaka> dont think it'll get that low anymore
[15:05] <KimiSleep> I was at the north in the mountains, probably was colder than that
[15:09] <Kabouter> Move South osaka :P
[15:09] <Kabouter> The most we've had was like -15
[15:10] <Kabouter> :P
[15:12] <minty> hello my jewro friends
[15:19] <PopOnArrival> Hmm, made a UK account to download the Killzone 2 demo. Gonna shoot myself if it's like 1.5gigs and 3 minutes long. 
[15:20] <Kabouter> You never know
[15:20] <Kabouter> It might be a lot more than 1.5GB
[15:23] <minty> kz2 demo be out now?
[15:24] <PopOnArrival> Sony first party games have ridiculous sizes when it comes to demos.
[15:24] <PopOnArrival> It'll be out in a few hours according to the people in the killzone thread. 
[15:25] <minty> ahh
[15:25] <EviLoreTablet> shouldn't be a demo
[15:25] <EviLoreTablet> now no one will buy it etc.
[15:26] <minty> yeah. konami was smart
[15:27] <minty> releasing mgs4 demo like 4 months after the game came out
[15:32] <sp0rsk> youtube is slow
[15:38] <Shinobi_Arshavin> konami was smart? they sold like 300,000 copies of mgs4 from july till december!
[15:44] <EviLoreTablet> it's a dead platform after all
[15:48] <Hitokage> glorified blu-ray player
[15:49] <Kabouter> Wow
[15:49] <Kabouter> Halo Wars was not a cheap game to make
[15:49] <Kabouter> They spent some serious money on those cutscenes
[15:49] <PopOnArrival> Are they live action?
[15:49] <Kabouter> No
[15:49] <Kabouter> But really good CG
[15:54] * EviLoreTablet has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[15:56] <Shinobi_Arshavin> all that for wii level visuals in game
[15:58] * EviLoreTablet has joined #GA
[15:59] <Kabouter> Nah, the game doesn't look that bad for an RTS
[15:59] <Kabouter> I mean, not particularly great either, just not bad

[16:02] <Shinobi_Arshavin> heh
[16:02] <Shinobi_Arshavin> hey dark
[16:03] <Darkh23> hi
[16:03] <Darkh23> kz2 demo day!!!!!
[16:03] <Darkh23> everyone get pumped!!
[16:04] <Shinobi_Arshavin> yeah......
[16:04] <EviLoreTablet> once again entertaining the notion of selling off most of my media crap.  you know, I come close to pirating stuff I already own sometimes just because it's hassle free compared to the legit product.  I barely even use my movie collection anymore anyway, when I do want to watch something I can just netflix it.  heh.  
[16:05] <Shinobi_Arshavin> hehe
[16:05] <EviLoreTablet> of course, I'd get shit for it all if I sold it all together, and that'd mean shipping individually through amazon or something, ughhh
[16:07] <EviLoreTablet> I got too caught up in buying things legitimately just because I could.  one viewing doesn't justify a purchase, and I don't rewatch stuff I like for a long time, I wait until it's fresh again (several years...)
[16:08] <EviLoreTablet> of course I'm mainly thinking about this because I have a bunch of boxes sitting in my living room while I decide on a shelf arrangement.
[16:08] * EGM92_AnalRapist has joined #GA
[16:10] <Hitokage> I suggest going halfway with that
[16:11] <Hitokage> get rid of the stuff you shouldn't have bought, keep stuff you really like
[16:11] <Hitokage> besides
[16:11] <Hitokage> what will you do when Netflix goes out of business?
[16:11] <EviLoreTablet> well that's the thing.  the more I like something, the more I tend to wait LONGER to rewatch it.  like more = more memorable = takes longer to be fresh again
[16:11] <Hitokage> ...
[16:12] <stump> Honestly I ripped all of my DVDs and then boxed them for storage. Best of both worlds. Digital convenience + no active space taken up.
[16:13] <EviLoreTablet> well there's the dirty pirate method of ripping everything and then selling it :/
[16:13] <stump> ahahha
[16:13] <Hitokage> but then you'd never find anything
[16:13] <Hitokage> "it's in a spindle somewhere"
[16:14] <Kabouter> Buy HDD's!
[16:14] <EviLoreTablet> hdd space is cheap
[16:14] <Kabouter> Yeah, just buy like 20 1.5TB drives
[16:14] <Hitokage> hd crash
[16:14] <Kabouter> And you're golden
[16:14] <EviLoreTablet> raid arrays!
[16:15] <stump> At 1 gig a rip you could rip your entire collection (unless you REALLY got out of hand buying things) on one hard drive.
[16:15] <EviLoreTablet> I'd be storing images
[16:16] <EviLoreTablet> heh
[16:16] <Hitokage> "images"
[16:16] * EGM92_AnalRapist has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[16:17] <stump> EviLoreTablet: well you'd still be okay with a couple 1.5s unless you've got a sizable blu-ray collection
[16:17] <EviLoreTablet> yah
[16:19] * Unison_ has joined #GA
[16:25] <Kabouter> Ugh, Halo Wars is about as bog standard as it gets
[16:26] <Unison_> just pretend it doesnt exist
[16:26] <Unison_> it's worked for me so far
[16:26] <Kabouter> lol
[16:26] <Kabouter> It's like RA3 without the zany shit that made that game fun
[16:26] <Unison_> truth
[16:28] <Unison_> it does have the rich tapestry of the Halo backstory to fall back on though
[16:29] <Hitokage> EviLoreTablet: you could get into buying books
[16:29] <Hitokage> tangible value!
[16:29] <EviLoreTablet> well I bought a ton of graphic novels
[16:30] <EviLoreTablet> at least those would resell near 1:1 if I wanted to get rid of them
[16:30] <Hitokage> electronic reading sucks in comparison to paper
[16:30] <EviLoreTablet> *nod*
[16:30] <EviLoreTablet> when it comes down to it though I kinda want to give up buying media all together, except for games
[16:31] <Hitokage> commie
[16:31] <OrinX> avcables you here
[16:31] <OrinX> fuck
[16:31] <OrinX> jmrefdjotjg
[16:31] <Hitokage> --------->
[16:32] <sp0rsk> games are too god damn expensive
[16:32] <sp0rsk> and gaf is retarded
[16:33] <Hitokage> EviLoreTablet: well, I'm the kind of person who likes being able to watch something at the time I'm in the mood for it, so buying stuff works for me
[16:33] <EviLoreTablet> *nod*
[16:33] <Hitokage> but at least you're not like tre, who has a vendetta against rewatching anything ever
[16:34] <KimiSleep> what should my upload limit on bitorrent be.. I'm kinda playing with it and the effect seems to be half random
[16:34] <KimiSleep> sure I do unlimited while not downloading but what about when downloading
[16:34] <Hitokage> I use 20KB/s
[16:34] <sp0rsk> if i lived in australia, id probablys tart up an isp that doesnt suck ass
[16:34] <sp0rsk> then again, id never live in such a shithole
[16:35] <KimiSleep> my ISP is pretty shit too, I'm supposed to be getting 8Mbit but right now I'm only getting ~5Mbit but I don't have the time or patience to call them up right now
[16:35] <KimiSleep> isn't 20kbps kinda low though?
[16:35] <Hitokage> heh, the wildlife there does indeed make living there prohibitive
[16:36] <Hitokage> KimiSleep: not according to my download speed
[16:36] <KimiSleep> which is?
[16:36] <Hitokage> 100-400KB/s
[16:37] <sp0rsk> i downloaded this weeks lost at...3.3MB a second...
[16:38] <Hitokage> well good for you
[16:38] <sp0rsk> it is good for me
[16:38] <sp0rsk> cause i have to go to bed soon
[16:39] <sp0rsk> and i needed to encode it for my ipod so i can watch it on the train in the morning!
[16:39] <sp0rsk> next week is sf4...
[16:39] <Hitokage> I wish I had a computer capable of encoding something overnight
[16:39] <sp0rsk> you fo all people dont have a nice computer?
[16:40] <Sea_Manky> Hito: What do you have?
[16:40] <Hitokage> my desktop is an AthlonXP 3000+/400FSB w/ a Geforce 5900
[16:40] <Hitokage> my other computer is an iBook G4
[16:41] <Sea_Manky> I haven't the faintest clue how fast an athlon is supposed to be

[16:41] <Kabouter> http://images.gamersyde.com/gallery/public/10032/1781_0002.jpg < Hehe this looks familiar
[16:41] <Sea_Manky> but yeah, a low power G4 will take some time to encode shit
[16:41] <Hitokage> pentium 4 ish
[16:42] <Hitokage> as in, less than any of that newfangled x86-64 crap
[16:42] <Sea_Manky> my dual g5 takes about twice the run time to encode things, if I recall correctly
[16:42] <sp0rsk> my computer is a xp 3800+
[16:42] <sp0rsk> er
[16:42] <sp0rsk> x2
[16:42] <sp0rsk> sorry
[16:43] <Hitokage> that's a a64 :P
[16:43] <Hitokage> AXPs weren't made over 3200+
[16:43] <sp0rsk> yeah...
[16:43] <sp0rsk> i need a new mobo\ram\cpu though
[16:43] <sp0rsk> prolly get one before the end of the year
[16:43] <Kabouter> Why?
[16:43] <sp0rsk> waiting for i7 prices to drop
[16:43] <Kabouter> X2 3800+ isn't bad
[16:43] <sp0rsk> cause i like to keep my sh it up to date
[16:44] <sp0rsk> the ram and all that is kinda bottle necking my 8800gt
[16:44] <Hitokage> I'm holding out hope that Mac Mini is gonna get nvidia graphics with a c2d or better
[16:44] <Sea_Manky> I'd like to get a cheap intel mac just so I can dork around with the iphone devkit
[16:44] <Hitokage> because then I'd buy one
[16:44] * syllogism has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[16:44] <Sea_Manky> but I really can't afford to
[16:44] <Sea_Manky> ESPECIALLY since I just had to buy a new god damn monitor yesterday. >:|
[16:45] <sp0rsk> what monitor
[16:45] <sp0rsk> i got a new monitor last weekend
[16:45] <sp0rsk> 22inch acer widescreen
[16:45] <sp0rsk> under 200 bucks
[16:45] <Sea_Manky> a 21" widescreen asus
[16:45] <Sea_Manky> I was considering the Acer, but Asus had a better rep and was full HD for only $30 more
[16:46] <sp0rsk> having 2 screens is so awesome
[16:46] <sp0rsk> and wow looks so good on my widescreen
[16:46] <Sea_Manky> Well, I might use 2 screens to test out multiscreen handling code in my game libraries, but I'm gonna put this one in storage, the dim bottom is irritating as hell
[16:47] <sp0rsk> ah, i just got another screen cause i wanted it
[16:47] <Sea_Manky> heh, my budget isn't big enough for stuff I just want. :P
[16:47] <Sea_Manky> My lower backlight on this monitor went out yesterday
[16:48] <Sea_Manky> tried cracking it open, and pretty much determined I'd most likely destroy it trying to get to the backlight and inverter
[16:48] <Sea_Manky> And since my current emergency spare monitor is a huge ass 17" CRT with extreme bleeding, figure I might as well upgrade and make this the spare, since it's at least usable

[16:54] <EviLoreTablet> hrm, got to the world of ruin.  I must be min/maxing too much, atma weapon didn't hurt me at all :/
[16:56] <EviLoreTablet> or more likely that I just got lost on the floating continent for so long that I gained like 5 extra levels and got another genji glove off a dragon, heh.  that was an "OH WOW!" moment!
[16:56] * rkSICK is now known as rkSLEP
[16:58] <EviLoreTablet> I dunno why but I'm enjoying ff6 more this time than when I was at my height of jrpg-whoring.
[16:59] * EGM92_AnalRapist has joined #GA
[16:59] <EviLoreTablet> and the systems in this game are probably better than any ff since....if the stats besides vigor and magic power mattered, and uhhh maybe if evade worked, it'd be even better.
[17:04] <Kabouter> Hahahahaha. Chairman of a religious TV broadcaster here signed a document distancing himself from creationism, now the members of the broadcaster aren't happy. I can't believe the fool didn't see that one coming.
[17:05] <EviLoreTablet> well, I'm partial to ff8's junction system but I know it too well after a few playthroughs, to the point where I'm doing like 9999 damage normals super early in the game :/   At least ff6 has a shitload more character ability uniqueness than the later ones, while still allowing heavy customization.  
[17:06] <Kabouter> 61% of members believe the earth is 6000 years old
[17:06] <Kabouter> What a bunch of retards
[17:06] <KimiSleep> members of what?
[17:06] <KimiSleep> wait.. no..
[17:06] <Hitokage> EviLoreTablet: evade and m-evade definitely work when they're at 50+%
[17:06] <duckroll> it depends on what version he's playing
[17:06] <duckroll> Evade didnt work in the original
[17:07] <Hitokage> but you need Illumina/Paladin Shield to boost them that high
[17:07] <duckroll> it was only fixed in the GBA version
[17:07] <duckroll> FFVI = superbugged
[17:07] <Hitokage> duckroll: worked on my SNES cart
[17:07] <KimiSleep> duckroll believes the world is 41 years old
[17:07] <Hitokage> but again, once I had it over 100% they evaded everything
[17:07] <duckroll> only the M-Evade stat counts
[17:07] <duckroll> the Evade stat doesnt
[17:07] <Kabouter> A psychiatric patient, a 45 year old from Nis, Serbia cut off his penis with a kitchen knife, and then threw it into the toilet and flushed it. However, he underwent surgery in Nis’ hospital on time, and his life is not in danger, writes Press Online.
[17:07] <Hitokage> ah, so m-evade affects both?
[17:08] <duckroll> yes
[17:08] <duckroll> its bugggggged
[17:08] <Hitokage> ahhh
[17:08] <Hitokage> ok
[17:08] <EviLoreTablet> I'm playing snes 
[17:08] <duckroll> Square didnt really have good QC back then
[17:08] <duckroll> lol
[17:08] <EviLoreTablet> yeah I didn't know the gba fixed that
[17:08] <Kabouter> After he was transferred to the urology clinic, the young man admitted that he cut off his organ with a kitchen knife, threw it into the toilet, and flushed it. They did not find the severed organ, so it was impossible to sew it back on.
[17:08] <EviLoreTablet> I am playing a "bugfix edition" rom but uhhh who knows what that means exactly...
[17:09] <Hitokage> what about ps1 ver
[17:09] <duckroll> PS1 version is pretty bad
[17:09] <Hitokage> (nevermind the load times making it suck in general)
[17:09] <duckroll> no point playing it
[17:09] <EviLoreTablet> I own it, but looooad timessssssss
[17:09] <duckroll> SNES or GBA imo
[17:09] <duckroll> only real worthwhile options
[17:09] <Hitokage> EviLoreTablet: you should run from fights more
[17:10] <EviLoreTablet> gba's a sub-snes platform though, it annoys me in general.  saw in reviews that the gba version has worse music and significant censorship so I stuck with snes
[17:10] <Hitokage> sucking the fun out of boss engagements by spending your time with fodder
[17:10] <Hitokage> nevermind Atma goes down to a vanish/doom attack
[17:10] <EviLoreTablet> heh not doing anything cheap at least
[17:11] <Hitokage> jRPGs are more fun in general underleveled
[17:11] <EviLoreTablet> I referenced a faq for the stupid emperor party stuff but for some reason my 24th soldier was not counted and I didn't get the damn encounter reduce relic
[17:11] <Hitokage> grind less, more interesting bosses
[17:13] <EviLoreTablet> of course it's the opposite in ff8 heh, grind more for harder bosses
[17:13] <Hitokage> ff8 is weird like that
[17:14] <Hitokage> speaking of games being better when you grind less
[17:14] <EviLoreTablet> would have to try something like a no triple triad no drawing run
[17:14] <Hitokage> you never got around to vp2 did you
[17:14] <EviLoreTablet> nope
[17:14] <EviLoreTablet> I still need to finish vp1.........................................
[17:14] <Hitokage> although as I remember it... yeah
[17:14] <Hitokage> somebody borrowed vp1 and never returned it
[17:15] <EviLoreTablet> I think I was returned it eventually, saw it when I was packing
[17:15] <Hitokage> hah
[17:15] <EviLoreTablet> that stuff was several years ago.  I eventually got suikoden 2 back too, in absolutely awful sandpaper-on-the-disc condition with no manual
[17:15] <EviLoreTablet> that's when it was worth like $300 of course
[17:16] <EviLoreTablet> dunno how much it goes for now
[17:16] <EviLoreTablet> :/
[17:17] <EviLoreTablet> also GG square for putting petrify-on-death enemies in a solo mission for celes at the beginnning of world of ruin.  
[17:18] <EviLoreTablet> had to do it over and equip an anti-petrify relic 
[17:19] <Hitokage> haha
[17:19] <EviLoreTablet> only time I've died...
[17:19] <Hitokage> one thing that might be interesting is an esper-less ff6 run
[17:20] <EviLoreTablet> could just grind
[17:21] <Hitokage> or use auto-fire and use fast-forward through the river loop
[17:21] <EviLoreTablet> lolz
[17:21] <Unison_> Daniel Alvarez of Austin, Texas has been arrested on charges of aggravated assault after he attempted to strangle his girlfriend with a Wii controller cord, according to police.

[17:22] <Unison_> She was apparently enraged because the suspect ate her supply of Girl Scout Cookies.

[17:22] <KimiSleep> that's like a south park plot

[17:23] <Hitokage> .....androgynous
[17:23] <Unison_> The two struggled until they ended up in the living room, where Alvarez grabbed a Wii controller, according to the affidavit. He put his knees on her chest to pin her down and strangled her with the cord of the video game controller, according to the affidavit.
[17:23] <Unison_> hahaha
[17:23] <Unison_> seriously, looks like a dyke

[17:25] <Kabouter> I think I need a new avatar and nickname, I post in the Halo Wars demo thread saying I've played this same game before. And people think I'm a PC snob who thinks Halo Wars isn't deep enough.
[17:25] <Kabouter> It's like they only see who is posting and not what I actually post
[17:25] <Darkh23> lol
[17:25] <Darkh23> ooo the demo came out?
[17:25] <Kabouter> Yeah
[17:25] <Hitokage> that's what you get for being a PC snob
[17:25] <Darkh23> should be a good thread today then
[17:25] <Hitokage> :P
[17:25] <Unison_> Darkh23 did you see that Sessler video?
[17:25] <KimiSleep> may I suggest a killzone avatar
[17:26] <EviLoreTablet> wait wait, halo wars is still coming out?

[17:26] <EviLoreTablet> so ensemble died after finishing it?
[17:26] <Darkh23> Ghaleon isn't buying Halo Wars
[17:26] <Darkh23> that should tell you something
[17:26] <duckroll> EviLoreTablet: no
[17:26] <Darkh23> lol unison
[17:26] <Darkh23> did the kz2 thread have a hissy fiy?
[17:27] <duckroll> all non-Halo Wars staff were cleared out months ago
[17:27] <Unison_> haha i dunno
[17:27] <EviLoreTablet> ah
[17:27] <duckroll> and once Halo Wars is done, the rest will be cleared
[17:27] <Hitokage> that's motivating
[17:27] <Unison_> he also said: "Sit down and take a deep breath.. and while your mouth is open, shove your dick in it. That way I don't have to hear from you, and you can finally find a little satisfaction"

[00:24] <thesoapster> oh. 
[00:24] <Tiduz> if an rts isnt on pc it fails by default
[00:25] <thesoapster> Tiduz: 100% agree.
[00:25] <thesoapster> i would say the same goes for fps, but an exceptional few have squeaked through
[00:25] <olubode> lol
[00:25] <Tiduz> haha
[00:25] <Tiduz> i played cnc3 on 360
[00:25] <Tiduz> horrible.
[00:25] <thesoapster> lol
[00:26] <olubode> its a step below starcraft, but not by a huge amount
[00:26] <olubode> again, I know that SC vets will chew up most
[00:26] <olubode> but it's pretty cool
[00:26] <thesoapster> starcraft was made in nineteen fucking ninety eight
[00:26] <thesoapster> ELEVEN YEARS AGO
[00:27] <thesoapster> it's sad that it still kicks the shit out of most rts games today
[00:27] <thesoapster> goddamn i feel like playing it now
[00:27] <Jideo> well if blizzard 
[00:27] <Jideo> had made a sequel

[00:28] <Jideo> i wonder how the community would have gone 
[00:28] <thesoapster> oh, yeah
[00:28] <Tiduz> and they are raping you while doing it
[00:28] <Tiduz> Want to play as protoss? lulz buy this expansion first

[00:29] <Jideo> only in single player
[00:29] <Tiduz> didnt you know
[00:29] <Tiduz> scii is terran only story

[00:29] <Tiduz> terran is first up
[00:29] <Jideo> lol oh he didn't know
[00:29] <thesoapster> but that's just the campaign, right
[00:30] <fallout> yeah, just campaign
[00:30] <thesoapster> you can still skirmish/bnet with everyone
[00:30] <thesoapster> ok
[00:30] * JCX has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.6/2009011913])
[00:30] <fallout> and the campaigns are going to be about the same length as ALL of SC
[00:30] <thesoapster> well that doesn't bother me much. they probably want to make the story better/longer...who knows. 
[00:30] <Tiduz> still rape
[00:30] <thesoapster> right
[00:30] <Tiduz> i dont want 3 versions
[00:30] <Tiduz> >:|
[00:30] <thesoapster> lol
[00:30] <Tiduz> unless its cheaper
[00:30] <thesoapster> well i mean
[00:30] <fallout> you'd buy 2 expansions
[00:30] <thesoapster> it would seem to me that they're not all standalone 
[00:30] <Jideo> not really as if they're expansions
[00:30] * bluemaxmini has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[00:30] <Tiduz> yeah
[00:30] <Tiduz> overpriced expansions.
[00:30] <Shinobi_Arshavin> lakers = streak stoppers
[00:31] <Tiduz> They are DLCing pc owners
[00:31] <Tiduz> lol.
[00:31] <thesoapster> you buy one main version, then buy expansions for campaign
[00:31] * bluemaxmini has joined #GA
[00:31] <thesoapster> well until we see pricing...eh.
[00:31] <thesoapster> i played through sc and brood war campaign 
[00:31] <thesoapster> but really the best part was multiplay and skirmish
[00:32] <fallout> I like that they're putting more time into the campaigns ... Blizzard ones are about the only RTS campaigns I've really enjoyed

[00:40] <Lo-Volt> Just in time.
[00:40] <darkh23> why wouldn't they
[00:40] <shuri> pioneer getting out of the tv business?
[00:40] <Tiduz> i dunno, since they stopped
[00:40] <Tiduz> how would they give you a new one
[00:40] <WasabiKing> I think it's sorta why I don't really like mass effect for PC
[00:40] <WasabiKing> the controls are sorta fucking gimped
[00:40] <Lo-Volt> Keep enough replacement parts to meet the law, I guess.
[00:40] <Kabouter> It does play better with pad yes
[00:40] <darkh23> tiduz...companies are required by law to keep 7 years of parts for repairing shit in stock
[00:40] <WasabiKing> and the characters are essentially the same
[00:40] <Shinobi_Arshavin> pioneer to stick with making car stereos that aren't selling since nobody's buying any cars

[00:41] <Kabouter> There is no one as annoying as Carth
[00:41] <Lo-Volt> Well, I don't think a Pioneer car stereo is built to the standards of a Kuro.
[00:41] <WasabiKing> dude who questions his existence
[00:41] <Jideo> oh yeah shit
[00:41] <Kabouter> I mean, Kaidan is close

[00:44] <Kabouter> Yeah, the sidemissions are fucking shit WasabiKing
[00:44] <Kabouter> Don't bother with most
[00:44] <darkh23> "PC gamers want same DLC as consoles"  don't care
[00:44] <WasabiKing> however

[00:44] <Shinobi_Arshavin> yeah, pc gamers wanna spend 5 bucks on sf4 costumes, shut the fuck up
[00:44] <WasabiKing> and dodging
[00:44] <Kabouter> There is like one you really wanna do, about some rogue AI, you'll be contacted about it at one point by the admiral. Do that one WasabiKing.
[00:44] <WasabiKing> what fucking novel concepts
[00:44] <Tiduz> pc gamers can just mod the costumes in there
[00:45] <Tiduz> and nude patch it
[00:45] <Tiduz> lol.
[00:45] <WasabiKing> haha yeah
[00:45] <Shinobi_Arshavin> NO NO THEY WANT SAME DLC AS CONSOLERS LULZ
[00:45] <darkh23> "Stop charging for skimpy DLC"    uhhhh PC doesn't have that problem....
[00:45] <WasabiKing> PC gamers really are the master race
[00:45] <Shinobi_Arshavin> idiot
[00:45] <WasabiKing> accept
[00:45] <Shinobi_Arshavin> pc gaming just shits on consoles
[00:46] <Tiduz> http://i131.photobucket.com/albums/p294/bill0527/PIC-0056.jpg

[00:46] <Jideo> you can wasabi there is a zoom on the mako for accurate shooting
[00:46] <darkh23> catching up to my 3000
[00:46] <darkh23> lolz
[00:46] <Jideo> even though your recticle is already on the enmey..
[00:46] <Jideo> its a bit silly 
[00:47] <jakehk> shinobi
[00:47] <jakehk> how bout the best team in the world manchester united
[00:47] <WasabiKing> jide: guess I'm not pressing the right buttons
[00:47] <Jideo> i think its shift
[00:47] <Jideo> for the default key
[00:47] <WasabiKing> but the controls overall is SHIT
[00:47] <Jideo> indeed agreed
[00:47] * mrsolo has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[00:47] <WasabiKing> seriously consolized
[00:48] <BJ34> I wonder if my Gamerscore is that high
[00:48] <darkh23> thinking of getting the steam deal for GRAW 1&2
[00:48] <Kabouter> http://i43.tinypic.com/npnzf4.jpg < PC gaming ftw
[00:48] <darkh23> hmmm
[00:48] <WasabiKing> at least KotOR was better
[00:48] <WasabiKing> also I don't like how you have to hold down the spacebar
[00:48] <WasabiKing> to plan tactics
[00:48] <BJ34> It may be, because I played one game of Madden 07 and unlocked half the achievements by happy accident
[00:48] <darkh23> lol
[00:48] <WasabiKing> and the AI is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo shitty too
[00:48] <Lo-Volt> Oh, LOL, Pro Bowl.
[00:48] <Kabouter> It's weird
[00:48] <darkh23> EA achievements -- "press start -- 5 pointz!!!!"
[00:48] <BJ34> ACHIEVEMENT: Call Punt Block on 1st down.
[00:49] <Kabouter> There is so much shitty stuff about Mass Effect
[00:49] <darkh23> lol
[00:49] <Kabouter> But I still love the game
[00:49] <Shinobi_Arshavin> lulz @ pro bowl
[00:49] <Shinobi_Arshavin> aka the most pointless game on earth
[00:49] <WasabiKing> yeah
[00:49] <Kabouter> One more shitty thing btw, the conversations
[00:49] <WasabiKing> the worst of all the all star games
[00:49] <Shinobi_Arshavin> by a mile
[00:49] <Kabouter> Bioware still hasn't figured out how to give players more moral choices other than goody two shoes and asshole
[00:49] <Lo-Volt> It really is.
[00:49] <Lo-Volt> What is the point again?
[00:49] <WasabiKing> well
[00:49] <Shinobi_Arshavin> still if I was a player, I'd go
[00:49] <WasabiKing> you can up charm
[00:49] <Lo-Volt> Well...
[00:49] <Shinobi_Arshavin> tap up some hawaiian girls
[00:49] <WasabiKing> of course
[00:49] <DrForester> kabouter, least kotors choice system was better than fllout 3
[00:50] <WasabiKing> free trip
[00:50] <Lo-Volt> It is a nice locale.
[00:50] <DrForester> fallout 3's story makes no sense if you go evil
[00:50] <Lo-Volt> Sure.
[00:50] <Kabouter> Yes, but that just gives you more goody two shoes choices
[00:50] <Kabouter> And intimidate gives you more asshole choices
[00:50] <Lo-Volt> But I didn't ask that from their perspective.
[00:50] <Jideo> yeah i didn't like the fact that you're better off
[00:50] <BJ34> Pro Bowl is probably a nice negotiating tactic too
[00:50] <Jideo> picking a side from the start
[00:50] <Shinobi_Arshavin> LOL @ kobe
[00:50] <Shinobi_Arshavin> just disgusting
[00:50] <jakehk> what channel is pro bowl on
[00:50] <jakehk> nm
[00:51] <WasabiKing> nbc right?
[00:51] <Lo-Volt> For us, well, how is this fun or interesting? Nothing's on the line, no one is fighting at the end of a play.
[00:51] <Lo-Volt> NBC.
[00:51] <Shinobi_Arshavin> the Idontgiveafuck channel
[00:51] <WasabiKing> lol
[00:51] <Shinobi_Arshavin> same diff
[00:51] <WasabiKing> Journeyman!
[00:51] <jakehk> ill just watch to see the mentions of the world champion pittsburgh steelers
[00:51] <Shinobi_Arshavin> man, bron's defense on kobe was perfect
[00:51] <Kabouter> Though one thing Bioware did learn
[00:51] <BJ34> I think I had my TV on NBC earlier. Saw college gymnastics on and pressed record
[00:51] <Kabouter> Being asshole in Mass Effect is a lot more fun than it was in KotOR
[00:51] <Shinobi_Arshavin> haha jake
[00:51] <darkh23> damn this guy is hardcore....got 2x4s in his arcade stick   http://xs536.xs.to/xs536/09060/dsc01060797.jpg
[00:51] <Kabouter> In Mass Effect being an asshole means you punch people all the time
[00:51] <Kabouter> In the middle of conversations
[00:51] <jakehk> mass effect is gorbage
[00:52] <Armitard> mass defects
[00:52] <WasabiKing> I'm doing paragon first
[00:52] <WasabiKing> you like too human, so stfu
[00:52] <Kabouter> Who?
[00:52] * bluemaxmini has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[00:52] <Shinobi_Arshavin> cold
[00:52] <jakehk> so
[00:52] <WasabiKing> jake
[00:52] <jakehk> it was good
[00:52] <Kabouter> Wow
[00:52] <jakehk> for like a week
[00:52] <Kabouter> Too Human demo was fucking trash
[00:52] <darkh23> lol
[00:52] <darkh23> yeah
[00:52] <Kabouter> Not even just bad
[00:52] <Kabouter> TRASH
[00:52] <WasabiKing> For a week"
[00:53] <DrForester> <Kabouter> Too Human was fucking trash  <- fixed for ya
[00:53] <WasabiKing> you pimped it for a month
[00:53] <Lo-Volt> lol
[00:53] <jakehk> so
[00:53] <jakehk> u prolly play dem japanese games
[00:53] <jakehk> aint holdin that against u
[00:53] <Kabouter> lol
[00:53] <Shinobi_Arshavin> to be fair, jake was probably using the 'whichever way gaf goes, go the opposite' mentality
[00:53] <Kabouter> Japanese games lol
[00:53] <WasabiKing> then cried that people didn't give the game a chance
[00:53] <jakehk> i like rootin for tha underdog
[00:54] <Shinobi_Arshavin> yeah
[00:54] <Shinobi_Arshavin> of course I did that with pes
[00:54] <Lo-Volt> Is that what you call Dyack?
[00:54] <Shinobi_Arshavin> and it's turned to shit
[00:54] <jakehk> lol
[00:54] <Shinobi_Arshavin> so how's that worked out
[00:54] <WasabiKing> lol
[00:54] <Jideo> last i check dyack was flying so high Ballllllin
[00:54] <Shinobi_Arshavin> btw
[00:54] <jakehk> all i know about dyack is wut u f00s say in here
[00:54] <Shinobi_Arshavin> fifa update is expected tomorrow or tuesday
[00:54] <jakehk> why would i care about some guy who makes games
[00:54] <Lo-Volt> Well, I was gonna call him an asshole, but OK.
[00:54] <Jideo> i didn't even know who he was 
[00:55] <Jideo> until too human dropped
[00:55] <DrForester> people will lvoe dyack now that oo human bombed and his next game will be a Eternal Darkness sequel/prequel
[00:55] <Kabouter> Same here
[00:55] <Shinobi_Arshavin> dyack has shockingly said little since the npd charts showed too human to be barely relevant
[00:55] <jakehk> i think it got delayed shinobi
[00:55] <jakehk> til next week
[00:55] <Shinobi_Arshavin> too human's numbers would be impressive for a ps3 exclusive
[00:55] <Shinobi_Arshavin> yeah
[00:55] <Lo-Volt> SHOCKINGLY LITTLE.
[00:55] <Shinobi_Arshavin> some bug was found
[00:55] <Tre`> <Kabouter> Too Human was fucking trash
[00:56] <Shinobi_Arshavin> western conference pwning the eastern conference today
[00:56] <Shinobi_Arshavin> spurs > celtics
[00:56] <Shinobi_Arshavin> lakers > celtics
[00:56] <Lo-Volt> LOL Cleveland has a basketball team?
[00:56] <Shinobi_Arshavin> damn
[00:56] <Lo-Volt> Midwestern cities in general having b-ball teams, a curious concept.
[00:56] <Shinobi_Arshavin> man, the cavs are one of the best in the league
[00:56] <Shinobi_Arshavin> unbeaten at home
[00:56] <Shinobi_Arshavin> for the next 5 minutes anyway
[00:56] <Lo-Volt> Ha.
[00:57] <Lo-Volt> I still think it's funny.
[00:57] <Kabouter> «23:54:42» {Shinobi_Arshavin} dyack has shockingly said little since the npd charts showed too human to be barely relevant < Should've taken the Sony route of lying about huge sales in Europe
[00:57] <Lo-Volt> But then, I'm from New York. Out teams are real funny.
[00:57] <Shinobi_Arshavin> haha
[00:57] <WasabiKing> <Shinobi_Arshavin> dyack has shockingly said little since the npd charts showed too human to be barely relevant - probably ate himself into a depression
[00:57] <Lo-Volt> OUR* teams, too.
[00:57] <darkh23> lol
[00:57] <Shinobi_Arshavin> what basically happened is
[00:57] <darkh23> chocolate ice cream and cherry bon bons
[00:57] <Shinobi_Arshavin> he choked on a crow bone
[00:57] <Lo-Volt> A fat gym teacher, basically.
[00:57] <DrForester> Dyack:  "Too human is a mssive success, nearly everyoen in our office has gotten it and talks about it every day"
[00:57] <WasabiKing> lol shin and dark
[00:58] <Lo-Volt> I'm still stunned at the photo of Dyack in a wrestling single.
[00:58] <Lo-Volt> Singlet.
[00:58] <Lo-Volt> I'm too tired to type.
[00:58] <WasabiKing> it's such a massive success that the plans for the sequels are all but dead
[00:58] <Shinobi_Arshavin> dyack should've done some information minister shit
[00:58] <Lo-Volt> The first one did it all.
[00:58] <WasabiKing> it's a trilogy!
[00:58] <Shinobi_Arshavin> at least get a laugh out of the whole chirade
[00:58] <Lo-Volt> Who needs an improvement?
[00:58] <Jideo> to be fair using sales as a test for the quality of a game is unfair ;p as we all know too well
[00:58] <WasabiKing> lolz
[00:58] <Shinobi_Arshavin> of course
[00:58] <Shinobi_Arshavin> but the point is
[00:58] <Shinobi_Arshavin> he said the game would be a hit
[00:58] <Shinobi_Arshavin> and it bombed
[00:58] <WasabiKing> yeah but to get another you require sales
[00:59] <WasabiKing> he tried to make it all secretive
[00:59] <WasabiKing> to generate hype
[00:59] <WasabiKing> that failed
[00:59] <Shinobi_Arshavin> the beautiful thing about numbers is that they're black and white
[00:59] <Lo-Volt> http://blog.wired.com/photos/uncategorized/toohuman20070124032714014.jpg Don't forget.
[00:59] <Lo-Volt> Back row, third from right.
[00:59] * Danj is now known as Danj_sleep
[01:00] <Shinobi_Arshavin> there's just better ways to handle things then the way he did, which was to act like a fucking child
[01:00] <Lo-Volt> Dyack did have his moments.
[01:00] <Armitard> dyack had lots of moments
[01:00] <Lo-Volt> I was thinking his fleet actions against 1UP.
[01:01] <Lo-Volt> Always victorious there.
[01:01] <Shinobi_Arshavin> not hard to beat 1up
[01:01] <EGM92_AnalRapist> Listen all you need to know about Dyack is that he's french Canadian, it explains EVERYTHING
[01:01] <Lo-Volt> Well, yeah.
[01:01] <Shinobi_Arshavin> look how they wound up last month
[01:01] <Lo-Volt> Cold-blooded.
[01:01] <EGM92_AnalRapist> having 3 ex girlfriends all being french Canadian
[01:01] <Shinobi_Arshavin> wait, three?
[01:01] <Lo-Volt> I was just gonna say that the people who interviewed him got too drunk too often to fight him.
[01:01] <Lo-Volt> But, OK.
[01:02] <Shinobi_Arshavin> fool me once, shame on you...fool me twice, shame on me
[01:02] <Shinobi_Arshavin> fool me three times, i'm a fucking idiot
[01:02] <Lo-Volt> Lakers 101, Cleveland 91.
[01:02] <EGM92_AnalRapist> I feel sorry for people that work with Dyack
[01:02] <Armitard> yeah
[01:02] <BJ34> ugh, should not have google image searched for the wwf tag team "amazing french canadians"

[02:51] <darkh23> zzzzzzz
[02:51] <minty> should've went with the superior 360 version
[02:52] <minty> painless d/l, installation
[02:52] <darkh23> no thx to discs
[02:52] <Y2Kev> what is dark playing
[02:52] <Y2Kev> burnout?
[02:52] <darkh23> yep
[02:53] <minty> yeah a ps3 game..gasp
[02:53] <minty> btw y2. i didn't know you was into skate 2
[02:53] <Y2Kev> it's good
[02:53] <Y2Kev> they should have locked it at 30 fps
[02:53] <Y2Kev> not 60
[02:53] <minty> yeah
[02:53] <darkh23> yeah cause I'm always playing 360 games....gasp
[02:54] <minty> could've made everything a bit more detailed had they gone that route
[02:54] <jett> so skate 2 isn't a stable 60fps, not even on the treesitty edition?
[02:54] <Y2Kev> no
[02:54] <Y2Kev> in my experience it might even be a little better on ps3
[02:54] <Y2Kev> since it was lead
[02:54] <minty> no but a bit more smoother
[02:55] <Y2Kev> i don't think so
[02:55] <Y2Kev> i'm happy with the graphics
[02:55] <Y2Kev> but the framerate is a mess
[02:58] * pj has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[02:58] <Y2Kev> and there are some things about it that are retarded
[02:58] <Y2Kev> pedestrians are retarded
[02:58] <Y2Kev> why are they in the game
[02:59] <minty> should've made it like burnout. no pedestrians
[02:59] <Y2Kev> the pedestrians JUST get in the way
[02:59] <Y2Kev> like that's it
[02:59] <Y2Kev> the security guards are also retarded
[02:59] <Y2Kev> i should be able to pull out a gun
[02:59] <Y2Kev> and shoot them
[02:59] <Y2Kev> oh and the off-the-board controls are so lol
[02:59] <minty> buyers remorse..trade it in quick!
[03:00] <CajoleJuice> burnout has pedestrians in the form of cars
[03:00] <DrForester> man
[03:00] <CajoleJuice> lolz
[03:00] <DrForester> BBC america makes such horribel cuts to it's shows to fit them in
[03:00] <Y2Kev> no, i like it
[03:00] <Y2Kev> i think it's really fun
[03:00] <Y2Kev> but
[03:00] <Y2Kev> it was obviously rushed
[03:00] <Y2Kev> so EA could fire everyone
[03:00] <minty> haha

[03:08] <Y2Kev> yeah, in like 2003
[03:08] <thesoapster> i didn't
[03:08] <thesoapster> i pirated that shit and stopped play 2 days later
[03:08] <thesoapster> and was like "lol"
[03:09] <thesoapster> it was awful
[03:09] <minty> buu..1 million copies sold!
[03:09] <thesoapster> consumer numbers != quality 
[03:09] <thesoapster> just look at the jonas brothers

[03:10] <darkh23> no clue
[03:10] <darkh23> haven't played it since september
[03:10] <darkh23> lolz
[03:10] <thesoapster> XD
[03:10] * pj has joined #GA
[03:10] <darkh23> I'm feeling masochistic tonight...after Burnout installs and while I'm playing it I shall download Halo Snores
[03:11] <thesoapster> lol
[03:11] <thesoapster> i'm looking forward to that new halo 3 game where you play as the spec ops guy
[03:11] <thesoapster> that should be fun.
[03:11] <darkh23> Halo 2.49?
[03:11] <thesoapster> 3.49*
[03:11] <minty> i have to renew my xbl
[03:11] <thesoapster> or is it pre-3 story
[03:11] <darkh23> no no....Halo 2 HD 2.49
[03:11] <darkh23> that's the official title
[03:12] <thesoapster> i think you're lying to me.
[03:12] <thesoapster> :p
[03:12] <darkh23> best buy had 13 month cards for $30
[03:12] <darkh23> but that was last week
[03:12] <pj> dont bother with halo wars
[03:12] <minty> but it's so freaking annoying to take out theselive cards from them plastic boxes
[03:12] <thesoapster> odst
[03:12] <darkh23> thats the only way to renew...don't give them your damn credit card
[03:12] <pj> its exactly like every other console rts
[03:12] <minty> i actually have 2 of'em dark
[03:12] <darkh23> its suicide
[03:12] <thesoapster> orbital drop shock trooper
[03:12] <thesoapster> it's halo 3 :p
[03:12] <thesoapster> anyway. 
[03:12] <minty> and that free 3 month live that's coming with my gta4 dlc
[03:12] <darkh23> give them your credit card and they'll autorenew forever and ever!
[03:13] <minty> i'll be set until xbox 720 comes out
[03:13] <pj> their logic is that you shouldnt want to get rid of xbl anyway
[03:13] <darkh23> man gta4 dlc...I couldn't even finish the original game
[03:13] <pj> so what does it matter if they auto renew
[03:13] <thesoapster> i hope my 360 still turns on when that game comes out
[03:13] <pj> you'd do it anyway
[03:13] <minty> but...bikes!!
[03:13] <thesoapster> i haven't turned it on in months 
[03:13] <jman2050> wow
[03:13] <pj> bikes are the worst part of gta
[03:13] <jman2050> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6KCSmyWdbY
[03:13] <jman2050> this looks badass as hell
[03:13] <pj> they need to add more land and airplanes
[03:13] <pj> and parachutes
[03:13] <jman2050> so much glorious sprite work
[03:14] <pj> so i can jump off things
[03:14] <darkh23> god this update is 254MB and its going slower than the 3GB download (slight exaggeration)
[03:14] <minty> yeah like sr2
[03:14] <thesoapster> bikes in videogames are hilarious
[03:14] <pj> sr2 sucks though
[03:14] <minty> blasphmey
[03:14] <pj> i also wouldnt bother with the burnout update
[03:14] <pj> unless you play online
[03:14] <minty> yeah i think dark is getting it to play with other gaffers
[03:14] <darkh23> buh buh GAF said the colors were more vibrant
[03:15] <pj> it's at most 15.7% more vibrant
[03:15] <darkh23> I'm not paying for pass the controller party pack

[04:01] <stump> What does GAF have to do with anything?
[04:01] <jman2050> so are you gonna laugh maniacally behind the scenes?
[04:01] <Lo-Volt> I thought EviLore had this deal with NPD for that monthly data, right?
[04:02] <jman2050> while everyone argues endlessly about approximate sales totals of various 3rd party shovelware?

[04:06] <jman2050> aka people uner 40
[04:07] <jman2050> well no

[04:08] <jman2050> and a career .390 OBP
[04:08] <Shinobi_Arshavin> but that was the year where a whole bunch of people went nuts home run wise
[04:08] <jman2050> I think only Rickey is higher for that period
[04:08] <Shinobi_Arshavin> hehe

[04:15] <Shinobi_Arshavin> the only other one that's funnier

[04:17] <Shinobi_Arshavin> he's got less range at short than sylvester stallone as an actor
[04:17] <Gaime-^_^> it's because of his career-long yankee status

[05:07] <jett> amirite
[05:08] <jakehk> no
[05:08] <Unison> haha that was just a fad
[05:08] <Lo-Volt> The country stuff is light-years ahead of Katy Perry.
[05:08] <Tiduz> http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1066/3265373006_5b756666ca.jpg
[05:08] <Unison> they are thinning the blacks back out
[05:08] <Tiduz> lol
[05:08] <Unison> oh man Katy Perry was so awful
[05:08] <Unison> INSANELY BAD
[05:08] <Unison> i saw it while eating

[05:08] <Tiduz> but you can find multiple ones
[05:08] <Unison> not talent AT ALL
[05:08] <Lo-Volt> I was listening to Stone Roses' "...Adored" while watching Katy on mute.
[05:08] <Tiduz> i think theres 4 or 5
[05:08] <jett> the grammies showss me i'm completely out of touch with popular music
[05:08] <Lo-Volt> Stone Roses couldn't even save this.
[05:08] <jett> i barely know any of the nominated
[05:09] <Unison> i made a grammy nominees cd for my road trip over xmas
[05:09] <Unison> so i heard all of it at least once i guess
[05:09] <Lo-Volt> [22:08] <jett> the grammies shows me popular music is completely out of touch with good taste
[05:09] <Unison> mostly awful
[05:09] <Lo-Volt> Fixed.
[05:09] <Unison> all ballads with surging violins
[05:09] <Unison> lol
[05:09] <jett> there's a band called the stone roses? how more fucking derivative can you get
[05:09] <CajoleJuice> LOL jett
[05:09] <Lo-Volt> Say what you will about country, but at least this woman is singing honestly.
[05:09] <Tony_Parker> emo

[05:09] <Unison> lol
[05:10] <Lo-Volt> This woman means whatever she sings about.
[05:10] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> Hey, can anyone tell me if I'm right in thinking that in 3D Zeldas, Nintendo includes a beta forest as a demonstration that they do not intend to include?
[05:10] <jakehk> k its bad
[05:10] <jakehk> but u can respect it
[05:10] <Lo-Volt> Honest stage presence.
[05:10] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> That is, they include it because it's easy to demonstrate it?
[05:10] <Lo-Volt> Better facial expressions.
[05:10] <Lo-Volt> Just her, a guitarist and a mic.
[05:10] <jakehk> even tho this is the unsexiest singer ever
[05:10] <jett> no idea what u talking about hippie
[05:10] <Unison> yeah Perry was like the worst thing in ages
[05:11] <Unison> this song won best country song or something earlier
[05:11] <jakehk> WAAAAHHHH

[05:11] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> jett: You mean you don't understand what I'm saying, or you don't know?
[05:11] <Unison> but the chick is fat
[05:11] <Unison> lol
[05:11] <jakehk> ...
[05:11] <Lo-Volt> Good if she's fat.
[05:12] <jakehk> no wonder the stage is so dark
[05:12] <Unison> they have to use a long shot
[05:12] <Unison> haha
[05:12] <jett> i mean i've never heard anything like that
[05:12] <Unison> closeups don't flatter
[05:12] <Lo-Volt> jake: OH WAIT.
[05:12] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> If the former, in the beta for TWW, TP, and OoT, they all have forest areas, and I recall reading that because it was easy to render these areas, they include them to demonstrate the gameplay.
[05:12] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> Ah.
[05:12] <Unison> i think Coldplay is gonna lose album of the year to jimmi page

[05:13] <Unison> some of it has a mild groove
[05:13] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> Gaime: Import the DS one.
[05:13] <Lo-Volt> It matters not.
[05:13] <Unison> honestly, it's decent
[05:13] * Gaime-^_^ gives uni a copy of Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon and Goemon's Great Adventure
[05:14] <Lo-Volt> What matters is they meant whatever they were singing and no one did yet.
[05:14] <Lo-Volt> So they win.

[05:21] <Lo-Volt> GAF is gossiping that he hit her.
[05:21] <Unison> they both ditched the grammys
[05:21] <Oldschoolgamer> this video shows why she is top tier amongst females
[05:21] <Unison> and the LAPD is lookin' for him

[05:54] <Tiduz> Tre`
[05:54] <Tiduz> is that the usa theme song
[05:54] <Tiduz> lol
[05:54] <Tre`> no
[05:54] <Tiduz> oh good
[05:54] <Tre`> the USA theme song is the JP theme song with english lyrics
[05:54] <Kagari> well, i guess i am going to go to the grocery store
[05:54] <Kagari> :/
[05:55] <Tiduz> hahaha lol
[05:55] <Tiduz> ok
[05:55] <Kagari> my mom wants me to get some stuff
[05:55] <Tre`> could you pick up a 10 pack of magnums?
[05:55] <Tre`> thx
[05:55] <Oldschoolgamer> lol
[05:55] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> I wish LucasArts would re-release adventure games as downloadable titles.
[05:55] <Kagari> lol
[05:55] <Tre`> that would require LucasArts to have a brain
[05:55] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> Like on Steam and the console services.
[05:56] <Tre`> and we know they don't
[05:56] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> True.
[05:56] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> But I sure can wish!
[05:56] <Kagari> Lucasarts is dead
[05:56] <Tre`> EA could do the same thing with their backlog
[05:56] <Tre`> Lucasarts = StarWarsIndianaJonesArts
[05:56] <Kagari> not even indy much anymore
[05:56] <Kagari> :/
[05:56] <Takuan> no money in harrison ford :(
[05:57] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> So I wonder if we'll see much merging/buyouts
[05:57] <thesoapster> Tiduz: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oznzWcfzZm8 this is pretty crazy. 99% on that song...goddamn 
[05:57] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> I think LucasArts may be bought out. The few big successes they have are not going to carry them.
[05:58] <Tiduz> thesoapster
[05:58] <Tiduz> someone managed 100%
[05:58] <thesoapster> yeah i know
[05:58] <thesoapster> but no video of it :p
[05:58] <thesoapster> it's a bit crazier to see them going at it
[05:58] <Takuan> http://thesuperficial.com/2009/02/katy_perry_has_talent.php?bfm_index=7 :D~
[05:58] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> I wish Guitar Hero would use a cartoonier style.
[05:58] <Oldschoolgamer> "L.I. Joe and Demon Hyo beat Combofiend and Gootecks in the 2v2. 2-1 sets."
[05:58] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> Remember GHIIXB's commercials?
[05:58] <Oldschoolgamer> Philly represent
[05:58] <New_Age_Retro_Hippie> That'd be nice, if it was doable.

[06:08] <jman2050> kz2 is about as wowsome as a console FPS can be, which is not a lot

[06:09] <Takuan> soap: the anime. i've never seen it, and it's totally not what i thought ti was

[06:27] <Lo-Volt> Especially when In Rainbows was such a, err, subdued affair? I know I can't explain myself well on things like this.

[06:29] <Lo-Volt> OK Computer is just such a rough sounding album to me. I think I'm starting to dislike albums where the vocalist relies on singing the way Yorke did in 1997.
[06:29] <Gaime-^_^> sounds really happy
[06:29] <dead> amnesiac and HTTF are huge pieces of shit though
[06:29] <dead> In Rainbows was a big improvement
[06:29] <Tre`> no
[06:29] <Tre`> Bends is for white people
[06:29] <jman2050> wait
[06:29] <Tre`> same as Kid A
[06:29] <jman2050> waitwait
[06:29] <IGotHimuroids> lmao te
[06:29] <IGotHimuroids> tre
[06:30] <jman2050> the main villain of Mario and Luigi 2 is Fawful?

[06:30] <Tiduz> ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[06:30] <jman2050> day 1 purchase
[06:30] <jman2050> erm
[06:30] <IGotHimuroids> there's some rock i just don't get 
[06:30] <Lo-Volt> OK Computer feels like an instrumental assault.
[06:30] <jman2050> Mario and Luigi 3
[06:30] <thesoapster> Gaime-^_^: nine inch nails song. probably one of their heaviest
[06:30] <IGotHimuroids> i like a portion of the bends, but i'd agree it's overrated in terms of radiohead albums
[06:31] <Lo-Volt> The later stuff sounds... rape me for saying it, but it sounds relatively elegant. Does that make more sense?
[06:31] <Unison> i just think that complaining OK Computer is abrasive makes no sense
[06:31] <Unison> as only Electioneering is particularly abrasive
[06:31] <dead> how is OK Computer abrasive
[06:31] <dead> its nearly as "safe" as teh bends
[06:31] <dead> Amenesiac is abrasive
[06:31] <dead> not OKC
[06:31] <Unison> it's "pretty" more often than it's aggressive
[06:32] <Tre`> besides
[06:32] <Tre`> abrasive isn't always bad
[06:32] <Tre`> the best album of the past 5 years was pretty abrasive
[06:33] <Lo-Volt> I always blow it explaining which albums I like and why.
[06:33] <Lo-Volt> I forfeit.
[06:33] <darkh23> blah stupid work....could drive around in burnout all night
[06:33] <Unison> what is that Tre`?
[06:33] <Tre`> Boris - Pink
[06:33] <dead> im sure people live abrasive music
[06:33] <Unison> oh that is too much for me
[06:33] <Tiduz> Unison
[06:33] <Tiduz> http://bossip.com/82103/lapd-chris-brown-under-investigation-for-beating-woman-did-he-hit-rihanna/
[06:33] <Unison> i listened to it and can appreciate it
[06:33] <Tiduz> hahahahahahahahahhahaha
[06:33] <Unison> but it is too much for me
[06:33] <dead> otherwise a fucking animal collective album wouldnt have  a thread on OT
[06:33] <dead> ugh
[06:33] <Tre`> it's a good measure of how big your balls are
[06:33] <Tre`> if you're lacking
[06:33] <Tre`> you won't like it
[06:33] <Tre`> Unison might be about average
[06:34] <Unison> LOL Rihanna gave him herpes
[06:34] <Lo-Volt> Err, can I at least say Yorke carries his tune better by the time Rainbows shows up and save some face?
[06:34] <Unison> i only listened to it like twice
[06:34] <Lo-Volt> Rihanna apparently gave CB herpes, hence the black eye.
[06:34] <Tre`> hahaha
[06:34] <Unison> when i saw it on some top ten lists
[06:34] <Tiduz> lol @ the pic too
[06:34] <Lo-Volt> GAF: "Good Boy Gone Bad."
[06:34] <Lo-Volt> http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/rihanna-and-chris-bra03f04.jpg
[06:34] <Lo-Volt> That one?
[06:34] <dead> can he press charges for her giving him an STD
[06:34] <dead> assuming she knew she had it
[06:35] <Tre`> Why is he upset
[06:35] <Tre`> herpes is treatable
[06:35] <Tiduz> es that one
[06:35] <Tiduz> yes*
[06:35] <Tre`> dead:  assuming she gave it to him
[06:35] <Tiduz> hitting a woman
[06:35] <Tiduz> smh
[06:35] <EviLore> treeeeeee
[06:35] <dead> well yeah
[06:35] <Tre`> I'm not going to criminalize the victim
[06:35] <Tre`> or pander to the woman
[06:35] <dead> fuck em both
[06:35] <dead> lol
[06:35] <Tre`> evilore:  almost!
[06:35] <Tre`> whose team am I on
[06:35] <Lo-Volt> I think it's because herpes is not curable.
[06:35] <Unison> i hope it ruins both of their careers
[06:35] <Unison> and we never have to see them again
[06:35] <Lo-Volt> Right? You are always at risk of passing it on.
[06:36] <dead> yeah
[06:36] <Tre`> aight, lemme throw this away and grab a drink
[06:36] <Lo-Volt> Not that he should hit someone, but I'd be pissed at that.
[06:36] <Unison> either that, or i hope they become the new ike & tina, and they beat each other up for the next 20 years
[06:36] <Lo-Volt> Tina could actually sing her heart out.
[06:36] <Tre`> and make amazing, classic music, unison?
[06:36] <Lo-Volt> Big difference already.
[06:36] <Unison> haha true
[06:36] <Unison> they are hacks
[06:36] <Lo-Volt> OH GOD TRE AND I AGREE ON MUSIC.
[06:36] <dead> I dont even know who the fuck chris brown is
[06:36] <Lo-Volt> Also, I really need to step my game up on expressing musical tastes.
[06:36] <Lo-Volt> :|
[06:37] <Lo-Volt> Did voltron get banned yet, by the way?
[06:37] <Unison> i actually prefer Marvin & Tammy
[06:37] <Unison> to Ike & Tina

[06:37] <Lo-Volt> No, he was arrested.
[06:37] <Unison> hahaha
[06:37] <Unison> what a pussy
[06:37] <Lo-Volt> That's the video.
[06:38] <Unison> i hope he gets beat up in prison
[06:38] <Lo-Volt> Fuck that video, can't see shit.

[06:39] <Lo-Volt> How did this mofo become a state governor?
[06:40] <Unison> i dunno, but i hope Val Kilmer becomes one too
[06:40] <Lo-Volt> Watch and see.
[06:40] <Lo-Volt> I wish he said that about passing a budget.

[07:40] <Gaime-^_^> 4-6 = namek, ginyu, frieza, right?
[07:40] <Kagari> no
[07:40] <Kagari> season 2 was namek
[07:40] <Gaime-^_^> oh
[07:40] <Kagari> 3 was freeza
[07:40] <Kagari> 4 is android saga
[07:40] <Gaime-^_^> 5 = imperfect cell, 6 = perfect cell?
[07:40] <Kagari> right
[07:41] <Gaime-^_^> you know what's kind of sad?
[07:41] <Gaime-^_^> it took funimation longer to dub the entire series
[07:41] <Gaime-^_^> than it did for the series to be made in japanese
[07:41] <Kagari> well
[07:41] <Kagari> true
[07:41] <Kagari> also, the dubbing work in the last season is really bad 
[07:42] <Kagari> i saw some clips on youtube
[07:42] <Kagari> :/
[07:42] <EviLore> don't watch dubs
[07:42] <EviLore> etc.
[07:42] <Kagari> at least early on it was decent
[07:42] <Kagari> but then watching in Japanese...
[07:42] <EviLore> watch shit in its original language.
[07:42] <Kagari> is way better
[07:42] <Gaime-^_^> by "last season" you mean kid buu?
[07:42] <TToB> Okay may as well quit while I'm ahed.
[07:42] <Kagari> nah, just the entire buu saga
[07:42] <TToB> Beat the ever living fuck out of Fei Long ;)
[07:42] <Kagari> the dubbing is horrid
[07:42] <Gaime-^_^> oh
[07:42] <Kagari> and they changed too many lines
[07:42] <Kagari> ugggggh
[07:42] <Gaime-^_^> yeah they did
[07:42] <TToB> Also got lucky beating a really good Z player I played against yesterday
[07:43] <Gaime-^_^> part of the reason why everyone is so confused about the strength of characters, too
[07:43] <Kagari> yeah...
[07:43] <Kagari> well, I watched those episodes back on fansub VHS years ago
[07:43] <Kagari> lol
[07:43] <Gaime-^_^> like, in japanese, Goku says "Yeah... Dabura doesn't seem all that tough.   About 7 years ago, we fought this guy named Cell.  He's probably around the same strength"
[07:44] <Oldschoolgamer> man. where are the vids from sinsation. >:(
[07:44] <Gaime-^_^> in the funi dub, goku's like "Maybe we would have had trouble with Dabura a few years ago.  You see, about 7 years ago, we fought this guy named Cell.  Now THAT was tough."
[07:44] <Kagari> lolz, funi
[07:44] <Gaime-^_^> like, they just completely change around stuff for no reason....
[07:45] <Kagari> yes, yes they do
[07:45] <Kagari> they also changed the music
[07:45] <dead> im gunna send you to the next dimension
[07:45] <Kagari> :/
[07:45] <duckroll> Gaime-^_^: i don't see no changing there
[07:45] <duckroll> unless you suck at english
[07:45] <dead> the US music is the worst shit I ever herd
[07:45] <dead> heard even
[07:45] <Gaime-^_^> and why is it that english dubs always feel the need to have dialogue at every point in the show
[07:45] <Kagari> IT
[07:45] <Kagari> IT'S MORE EPIC THAT WAY
[07:45] <duckroll> they're saying the Dadura is about the same strength as Cell 7 years ago
[07:45] <Kagari> :(
[07:45] <duckroll> and 7 years ago they sucked
[07:46] <Gaime-^_^> like, gohan's SSJ2 transformation.... funi dub has him doing this monologue  "Android 16.... you loved life.  And you were just an android.  I watched you die.   but I won't have it any more!"
[07:46] <Gaime-^_^> japanese just has hime stand there in stunned silence and then snap
[07:47] <Kagari> lol gaime
[07:47] <Gaime-^_^> also I noticed a lot of vegeta's dialogue gets changed a LOT
[07:47] <Kagari> there's a lot more silence in the Japanese
[07:48] <Gaime-^_^> espeically his death speech to goku against frieza
[07:48] <Gaime-^_^> it's completely different.

[08:21] <Armitage_DAFT> i remember reading an article online a few years ago about this computer that every few seconds would send a prayer, in text, to a random port of a random ip address
[08:21] <pj> jews dont believe in god
[08:21] <Armitage_DAFT> what about money?
[08:21] <pj> yeah but unless the prayer asks for donations i dont see why he would care
[08:24] <Armitage_DAFT> anyways i'm trying to find out more about this example in particular and the broader artsy idea in general
[08:24] <Armitage_DAFT> but i can't find it
[08:24] <Armitage_DAFT> i keep getting islamic prayer reminders and shit
[08:25] <Armitage_DAFT> specifically, what's a good way to insure that the text "gets there"?  i understand nothing will happen at the other end, the point is the sending of it
[08:26] <pj> depends on how it's being sent
[08:27] <Armitage_DAFT> it doesn't really matter, it'll be text typed in, and then shot out into the void
[08:27] <Armitage_DAFT> doesn't have to be a specific format or anything
[08:28] <pj> the internet doesnt work that way
[08:28] <Armitage_DAFT> i understand that

[01:05] <mrsolo_> Today, I went to my first strip club for my friends birthday. I also found out what my girlfriend does for a living. FML <- fake
[01:05] <mrsolo_> Today, in art class we finally had the critique for the self portraits we've been working on for a month. We critique a few and come to mine. Everyone is silent. Finally, one girl says "I'm just going to be blunt. It doesn't look like you. You're not that pretty." Everyone nods. FML
[01:05] <mrsolo_> hahaha
[01:05] <GaimeGuy> fmylife is like the new bash.org

[01:06] <Diablos`> Today, I farted in my cubicle thinking no one would smell it. Two seconds later, everyone came to my cubicle to wish me a happy birthday. FML
[01:06] <Diablos`> ahahaha
[01:06] <GaimeGuy> LOL
[01:06] <mrsolo_> hahahah
[01:08] <GaimeGuy> "Today, I heard my sister masturbating in her room. I took the dog around the block to get out of the house, and I came back to see her exiting her room....my electric tothbrush in her hand. FML"
[01:08] <Diablos`> Today, I went to get a condom because my boyfriend and I were going to have sex for the first time. When I opened the drawer, I saw that every single condom had a Jesus pin stabbed through it, and a note on top of the box: "love mom." FML
[01:08] <Diablos`> Christianity ftl
[01:08] <GaimeGuy> O_o
[01:09] <GaimeGuy> okay, seriously, poking holes in your child's condoms because you don't agree with them using contraception?

[01:11] <GaimeGuy> "Today, I wanted to have a good lunch with my wife before fasting for my surgery which I may not survive, she decided getting her hair cut was more important. I ate alone. FML"  <--- :(
[01:11] <OsgXsf4> I don't think it has anything to do with contraception
[01:11] <OsgXsf4> seems like she didn't want them fucking, period
[01:11] <Diablos`> "I'm a fun woman that likes to enjoy life. Keeping myself and those around me happy is of major importance. Spontaneity is appreciated, so is intelligence and class. Looking for someone that can balance their friends/job/relationship appropriately." Fuck you, bitch
[01:11] <GaimeGuy> o.o
[01:11] <OsgXsf4> did I miss something diablos?
[01:12] <GaimeGuy> "Today, I handed my PhD dissertation, which I have spent the past year researching and writing full-time. Last night, my roommate set an autocorrect on Word that changed "neither" to "nigger." I didn't notice until after I handed it in. My professor is black. FML"  <--- uh.... O_O

[01:17] <OsgXsf4> I'm 360 only atm
[01:17] <Sea_Manky> mrsolo: 295 today
[01:18] <Sea_Manky> Still not near my limit, but it's getting _really_ tough
[01:18] <mrsolo_> wow
[01:18] <WasabiKing> SHIT
[01:18] <WasabiKing> dhalsim
[01:18] <WasabiKing> lol
[01:18] <Sea_Manky> I'm doing well with my form tho
[01:18] <Tre`> haha
[01:18] <WasabiKing> waste of a character
[01:18] <mrsolo_> isn't dhalsim gimped in sf iv?
[01:18] <SanjuroTsubaki> i mean it is on the borderline of full out orgasm, without the cleaning up
[01:18] <OsgXsf4> don't you mean...isn't ken gimped.
[01:18] <OsgXsf4> wtf
[01:18] <SanjuroTsubaki> fuck'
[01:18] <minty> is he? i think he is ok
[01:18] <OsgXsf4> sim is okay
[01:19] <SanjuroTsubaki> no he is fine
[01:19] <SanjuroTsubaki> guile is the only one with a noticeable hit in power
[01:19] <Sea_Manky> dhalsim just plays completely differently in SF4
[01:19] <Tre`> sim is really good
[01:19] <Sea_Manky> I love using him in SF2, in SF4 nothing of his worked for me.
[01:19] <WasabiKing> yeah manky
[01:19] <mrsolo_> ya ..some one in shoryuken says drills are waste of time now
[01:19] <mrsolo_> yoga tower is interesting though :-)
[01:19] * nerbo has quit IRC (Quit: )
[01:20] <WasabiKing> lol
[01:20] <Tre`> the thing is
[01:20] <Tre`> dhalsim's about his air teleport now
[01:20] <Sea_Manky> before, standing forwards and roundhouses were useful against people jumping over yoga fires, not anymore
[01:20] <WasabiKing> I wonder if I could have blasted you back
[01:20] <mrsolo_> then again someone complains about cammy too
[01:20] <mrsolo_> none of her move is safe etc
[01:20] <WasabiKing> cammy is awesome
[01:20] <Tre`> his air teleport is really good
[01:20] <WasabiKing> must try
[01:20] <Tre`> especially since you can do an instant overhead air teleport
[01:21] <WasabiKing> ooh gen
[01:21] <mrsolo_> sea: that that was standard tactic as far as i remember
[01:21] <Sea_Manky> mrsolo: Yeah, and when I used him in SF4, they NEVER hit.
[01:22] <Sea_Manky> I dunno if it was the extra rubbery animation they added, but the damn things were just way too slow.
[01:22] <OsgXsf4> yay
[01:22] <OsgXsf4> I did my first spd
[01:22] <OsgXsf4> did they make this easier too?
[01:22] <Sea_Manky> anyway
[01:22] <OsgXsf4> I never played/play gief
[01:22] <minty> congrats!
[01:22] <minty> yeah it's a bit easier
[01:22] <Sea_Manky> time to rest while my wife starts on the meatloaf. :d
[01:22] <Sea_Manky> a lot easier
[01:23] <Sea_Manky> All the moves are a lot easier to do
[01:23] <Sea_Manky> My main problem was remembering to hit three buttons for ultras.
[01:23] <WasabiKing> nice tre
[01:23] <WasabiKing> manky: rent or buy?
[01:24] <Sea_Manky> TToB gamefly'd it
[01:24] <WasabiKing> ah
[01:24] <Lelielle> a friend came over who hadn't played SF since 2 and he got into it like riding a bike
[01:25] <Sea_Manky> Yeah, that's how alpha tricked me.
[01:25] <Sea_Manky> long gap blurs the memory
[01:25] <Lelielle> lol
[01:26] <Lelielle> it was like  watching someone meeting an old best friend at a reuinion and the friend is even more cool now
[01:26] <OsgXsf4> WOW. I'm still never playing gief, but i've done 5 ultras with him just now
[01:26] <OsgXsf4> The only special I ever landed with him was the change into dark mode in the Vs games
[01:27] <GaimeGuy> osg!
[01:27] <mrsolo_> i watched my daugher's vega played with ranked gief another day
[01:27] <Sea_Manky> I'd probably be all over SF4 if HDR hadn't come out
[01:27] <mrsolo_> first round he couldn't made off the random moves..she actually managed to win!
[01:27] <minty> how old is she now solo? 5?
[01:27] <DrForester> LOL
[01:27] <mrsolo_> then he proceeded to butchered her in round 2 and 3

We would not have begun importing and selling these swords if we knew that Square Enix would respond so aggressively to stop us. We will never make this mistake again."

[01:37] <EGM92> are any of you running OSX???
[01:38] <Sea_Manky> yes
[01:38] <EGM92> manky I had to reinstall leopard on my MBP
[01:38] <Tiduz\`> It has been shouted from many a roof top that the PS3 will have 10 year lifespan, but Sony has finally shown some doubt about this. Speaking in an interview, David Reeves he noted that he is not sure of the lifespan, indicating that it could even be just 8 years.
[01:38] <Sea_Manky> k
[01:38] <Tiduz\`> boom.
[01:38] <EGM92> Now  I need to do some software updates
[01:39] <minty> that's 8 years too long
[01:39] <EGM92> it's asking me for my admin pass, but the fields doesn't have my username by default anymore.
[01:39] <Tiduz\`> lol minty
[01:39] <Sea_Manky> type it in
[01:39] <Tiduz\`> h8er
[01:39] <EGM92> And my admin pass no longer works, though it's the same pass I login to my account with
[01:39] <Tiduz\`> >:|
[01:39] <minty> kill it already. releases ps3.6 with more ram
[01:39] <Tiduz\`> you just want hsg with boob and grass physics
[01:39] <Tiduz\`> A female gamer indicates that she was banned from Xbox LIVE as she identified herself as a lesbian in her profile. After appealing to MS, they gave her a response that other gamers found her sexual orientation offensive, hence the ban.
[01:39] <Sea_Manky> did you put your account login in there?
[01:39] <Tiduz\`> hahahahahahahahahahaha
[01:40] <Tiduz\`> owned
[01:40] <EGM92> yes I did
[01:40] <Sea_Manky> Only thing I can think of is that your account doesn't have administrator priviledges.
[01:40] <EGM92> wtf.
[01:40] <EGM92> How can I change that?
[01:41] <Tiduz\`> ''A designer of Street Fighter HD remix has attacked Street Fighter IV. He is in disagreement with reviews and says the game is not simple and it certainly is not casual friendly.''
[01:41] <Tiduz\`> wat
[01:41] <Sea_Manky> go to Accounts in system preferences, poke around there
[01:41] <minty> can't you boot from you osx disc and rest your admi pw?
[01:41] <Jideo> yeah david sirlin 
[01:41] <minty> rest=reset
[01:41] <shuri> yeah you can, minty
[01:41] <Sea_Manky> If your account is an admin, it should say so
[01:41] <shuri> its in the option
[01:41] <shuri> you can reset your password from any osx disc
[01:42] <Tre`> david sirlin's arguing with the casual fighting game playing reviewers that it's not, in fact, casual friendly
[01:42] <EGM92> under accounts, my account is "Standard"
[01:42] <Sea_Manky> if it's not, do like minty and shuri said, and make sure to add admin rights to it
[01:42] <Sea_Manky> yeah, it's not an admin account
[01:42] <EGM92> I don't have my OSX discs with me
[01:42] <EGM92> they're at home in my desk
[01:43] <Sea_Manky> no other admin accounts on there?
[01:43] <EGM92> Nope, I only use this laptop
[01:43] <Sea_Manky> then you'll have to wait to install those updates.
[01:44] <Sea_Manky> wait, is your root account enabled?
[01:44] <EGM92> root account?
[01:44] <thesoapster> lolz
[01:44] <Sea_Manky> yeah, every unix based system has a root account with total control
[01:44] <thesoapster> EGM92: is this your laptop? 
[01:44] <EGM92> yes
[01:44] <thesoapster> how are you a standard
[01:44] <Sea_Manky> you typically don't use it, but if you have it enabled you could use it to add admin privs to yours
[01:44] * pj has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[01:45] <EGM92> soap again, that's a good fucking question
[01:45] <thesoapster> usually primary user is in with admin privs
[01:45] <EGM92> I repaired Leopard and my pass stopped working
[01:45] <thesoapster> ok, you're in leopard
[01:45] <thesoapster> go to applications > utilities > directory utility 
[01:46] <thesoapster> i don't know if you can hit the lock to unlock it and make changes or not with your password...
[01:46] <thesoapster> somehow i don't think you'd be able to
[01:46] <EGM92> No Directory Servers Configured
[01:46] <Sea_Manky> any locks will require an admin password
[01:46] <thesoapster> yeah
[01:47] <thesoapster> right
[01:47] <thesoapster> that's what i'm worried about
[01:47] <Sea_Manky> longshot, try using the account name "root" and your password
[01:47] <thesoapster> does the lock say "click lock to make changes" or whatever?
[01:47] <EGM92> yes
[01:47] <Sea_Manky> if you had root enabled, the password should be the same
[01:47] <thesoapster> dammit
[01:47] <thesoapster> Sea_Manky: thing is...unless you go there and enable it yourself
[01:47] <thesoapster> it's not XD
[01:47] <Sea_Manky> yeah
[01:47] <thesoapster> i think you're locked out of your own fucking laptop lol
[01:48] <EGM92> WHAT THE FUCK
[01:48] <Sea_Manky> I dunno, if he can somehow install leopard with a non-admin account, maybe root is magically there.  :X
[01:48] <EGM92> Peice of shit apple
[01:48] <thesoapster> EGM92: are there ANY leopard discs around? 
[01:48] <EGM92> I have a OSX86 disk but that's not the same
[01:48] <Lelielle> http://up.2chan.net/d/src/1235402688349.jpg  -heh
[01:48] <thesoapster> :(
[01:48] <Sea_Manky> you're not locked out, but you won't be able to install anything that requires admin privs
[01:48] <thesoapster> right
[01:48] <osaka> the sf4 thread s fucking retarded
[01:49] <osaka> noobs whining about shoto players using hadoken and shoryuken
[01:49] <osaka> i mean what the fuck
[01:49] <EGM92> so I won't be able to do anything I normally do
[01:49] <EGM92> fuck OSX
[01:49] <osaka> OH MY GOD THIS GUY IS NOT LETTING ME CLOSE
[01:49] <EGM92> and fuck everything to do with apple that POS
[01:49] <thesoapster> EGM92: is this on a mac? 
[01:49] <EGM92> My MBP
[01:49] <Sea_Manky> sorry your machine has actual security that works.
[01:49] <thesoapster> hm
[01:49] <thesoapster> that's bizarre 
[01:49] <thesoapster> you said you reinstalled leopard? 
[01:50] <thesoapster> like an archive/install? 
[01:50] <shuri> look
[01:50] <shuri> all those fucks in the sf4 thread
[01:50] <shuri> they all try to pretend they are hardcore fighting games
[01:50] <shuri> but you see posts for them struggling against the cpu on medium
[01:50] <EGM92> Can I get into the repair from a Tiger dvd?
[01:50] <shuri> and crying about getting raped on xbl
[01:50] <shuri> 95% of gaf is filled with wannabes these days
[01:50] <thesoapster> EGM92: worth a try
[01:50] <shuri> its unbearable.
[01:51] <thesoapster> i know you can boot from it
[01:51] <Tre`> shuri:   duh
[01:51] <thesoapster> and you should be able to use a number of the same utilities 
[01:51] <thesoapster> but if you wanted to do a reinstall of the os 
[01:51] <thesoapster> you'd need leopard
[01:51] <thesoapster> but just like disk utility...i think you could run that off the tiger disc when booted and it'd work fine even if you're on leopard 
[01:51] <EGM92> pressing c takes me to a recovery menu right?
[01:52] <thesoapster> that boots to cd
[01:52] <Jideo> yeah shuri see its not casual friendly ;p
[01:52] <thesoapster> i'm not entirely sure what the recovery menu is... XD
[01:53] <EGM92> How am I supposed to reset the password with a leopard CD?
[01:53] <thesoapster> when you boot to the dvd 
[01:53] <thesoapster> by holding c on startup
[01:53] <shuri> i dont have the manual for sf4 :|
[01:53] <shuri> damn rental.
[01:53] <thesoapster> there is an option in one of the menus (ignore the installer menu) to change the os x password
[01:53] <EGM92> no doesn't work.
[01:54] <shuri> so i figured out you can do that knockdown attack that also 'parries' when you hit both mediums
[01:54] <shuri> its pretty neat
[01:54] <shuri> I really miss parrying tho.
[01:54] <shuri> like in sf3
[01:54] <Lelielle> http://dat.2chan.net/20/src/1234332232681.jpg :D~~~~ I haven't had strawberry shortcake in ages
[01:54] <osaka> shuri: i know what you mean haha
[01:54] <osaka> i admit that i suck though
[01:54] <osaka> i wanna learn!
[01:54] <minty> focas!
[01:55] <OsgXsf4> challenge mode is kinda difficult
[01:55] <osaka> i dont act all pro like the majority though but i do understand that turtling and zoning is a part of the game though
[01:55] <Tre`> people only liked parries because they could randomly get one
[01:55] <shuri> yep
[01:55] <Lelielle> SF4 has some cool mizxing up with the ex moves
[01:55] <Tre`> made them feel like daigo
[01:55] <Tiduz\`> focus attack dash trough a hadoken
[01:55] <Tiduz\`> is nice
[01:55] <shuri> so what other techniques are there in sf4? the thread is unreadable and i dont feel like going thru 120 pages of tools
[01:55] <shuri> yeah focus attack is the name of what i was describing
[01:55] <shuri> you have the super and ultra moves
[01:56] <minty> you got taunts
[01:56] <Lelielle> ex duo button moves
[01:56] <minty> cammy's butt
[01:56] <TEEEPO> MINTY IS AMAZING
[01:56] <minty> sakura's pantsu, etc etc
[01:56] <TEEEPO> at sf4
[01:56] <TEEEPO> best on gaf
[01:56] <minty> lies

[01:57] <thesoapster> ok, EGM92
[01:57] <minty> even cack is prob better than me

[01:59] <Tiduz\`> Omg

[01:59] <Tiduz\`> the chain has been broken
[01:59] <Tiduz\`> VGCats gaf thread
[01:59] <Tiduz\`> nooooooooo
[01:59] <Tiduz\`> went so long without one
[01:59] <Tiduz\`> http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e68/Wonder_Leone/1235578820281.gif
[01:59] <Tiduz\`> WTF hahahaha
[02:00] <Lelielle> ????
[02:00] <thesoapster> WOW
[02:00] <OsgXsf4> ahaha
[02:00] <minty> haha
[02:00] <Lelielle> you should see Miku miku dance
[02:00] <minty> america fark yeah
[02:00] <thesoapster> EGM92: anyway, after you do the passwd, reset your root password 
[02:00] <thesoapster> i've read that if you change the pass like that it enables you to login as root
[02:00] <thesoapster> you can then change your account to admin
[02:01] <thesoapster> hope that helps.
[02:01] <thesoapster> otherwise, lolz
[02:01] <Sea_Manky> orly, I didn't know you could enable the root account just by trying su
[02:02] <thesoapster> no, if you do passwd
[02:02] <Sea_Manky> anyway, bacon weave complete, meatloaf in oven! :d~~~~~~
[02:02] <thesoapster> changing the root password
[02:02] <thesoapster> but that's the thing
[02:02] <thesoapster> if he does sudo passwd 
[02:02] <thesoapster> i don't know how the sudo will run
[02:02] <Tiduz\`> ''Ubisoft announces new release date for "Prince Of Persia: Epilogue" on PSN & XBL – coming up on March 5th. Looking forward to see Elika again!''
[02:02] <Tiduz\`> wheeeee
[02:02] <Tiduz\`> sold
[02:02] <thesoapster> even if he's booted to the dvd
[02:02] <minty> haha
[02:02] <minty> elika dies again?!
[02:02] <minty> oh wait spoiler
[02:02] <Sea_Manky> sudo always requires the root password, so what happens if you try to run it without the root account enabled?
[02:02] <minty> .clear!!
[02:03] <thesoapster> not the root password per se
[02:03] <mrsolo_> sudo doesn't require root password
[02:03] * Takuan has joined #GA
[02:03] <thesoapster> but the account that you're logged in under's password...if it's an admin
[02:03] <mrsolo_> su require root pasword
[02:03] <GaimeGuy> obviously the system overheats and explodes
[02:03] <Sea_Manky> whoops, right
[02:03] <mrsolo_> but if your /etc/sudoers file is corrupted.. your doomed
[02:03] <minty> yeah sudo requres root pw
[02:03] <thesoapster> DOOMED
[02:03] <mrsolo_> sudo doesn't NOT require root pw
[02:03] <thesoapster> lol no it doesn't
[02:03] <thesoapster> silly minty
[02:04] <mrsolo_> hit yourself with gold fish minty
[02:04] <minty> it doesn't? mind blown
[02:04] <Sea_Manky> I just wonder how the hell he managed to install osx with a non-admin account
[02:04] <thesoapster> lol
[02:04] <thesoapster> Sea_Manky: yeah...
[02:04] <thesoapster> i would like to see that one in action
[02:04] <mrsolo_> again.. may be it was
[02:04] <thesoapster> as i've _never_ heard of that
[02:04] <mrsolo_> may be upgrade fucked up sudoers
[02:04] <minty> hey i haven't used osx in like ages
[02:04] <Tiduz\`> minty: Parkinson is a bitch.
[02:04] <Sea_Manky> minty: It's a unix thing really
[02:04] <Sea_Manky> I mixed up my su and sudo
[02:05] <minty> yeah that's one thing i liked about osx. i got to play with all these unix cmds
[02:05] <Sea_Manky> I thought that maybe the first time you attempted su it might allow you to set up root
[02:05] <Sea_Manky> of course, that would only make sense if you were an admin account anyway. :P
[02:05] <mrsolo_> naw
[02:05] <thesoapster> as of 10.5 leopard mac os x is an actual unix os...more unix than linux.
[02:05] <thesoapster> :p
[02:05] <mrsolo_> sudo bash than passwd
[02:06] <minty> ahh i see
[02:06] <mrsolo_> i dunno.. i usually setup root pw in osx because sudoer screws up all the time under osx
[02:06] <Sea_Manky> hmmm, and with no admin account to be seen...
[02:06] <Sea_Manky> Yeah, I always enable root
[02:06] <mrsolo_> even though it is..less safe
[02:07] <Tiduz\`> my mactard friend
[02:07] <Tiduz\`> pasted this to me
[02:07] <Tiduz\`> http://t-shirts.cafepress.com/item/krazyeuro-designs-dark-tshirt/95080322
[02:07] <Tiduz\`> and laughed hard
[02:07] <Tiduz\`> i dont get it.
[02:07] <thesoapster> rofl
[02:07] <thesoapster> that's the os x "hour glass"
[02:07] <Sea_Manky> That's the spinning beachball that replaced the watch cursor
[02:07] <thesoapster> the beach ball of death
[02:07] <mrsolo_> haha
[02:07] <mrsolo_> ya osx hour glass
[02:07] <thesoapster> so called because some apps hang
[02:07] <Tiduz\`> i never touched a mac
[02:07] <Tiduz\`> oh

[02:07] <Tiduz\`> lolz
[02:08] <minty> i encoutered that beach ball alot when i used osx 10.0 developer disc and 10.1
[02:08] <thesoapster> if you don't actually quit the apps sometimes they'll just hang 
[02:08] <Lelielle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5ZsjDeh6dg
[02:08] <thesoapster> and you'll be left with the beachball...
[02:08] <minty> it was so slow back then ;<
[02:08] <thesoapster> first mac i owned had panther on it
[02:08] <GaimeGuy> ah the beachball/hourglass  :(

[02:51] <mrsolo_> especially someone pour that hot oil on you heehee
[02:51] <Takuan> apparently they've ruined the witch elf with the new patch
[02:52] <mrsolo_> oh?
[02:52] <darkh23> new patch is out for WAR?
[02:52] <mrsolo_> witch elf isn't that poweful to begin with
[02:52] <Takuan> i think it's in testing phases
[02:52] <Takuan> the posts i read were made just yesterday or the day before
[02:52] * thesoapster has quit IRC (Quit: thesoapster)
[02:54] <Takuan> looting is annoying
[02:54] <mrsolo_> ..While I understand the concern over loosing the Armor Debuff on Peirce armor the Witch Elves (and Witch Hunters)... <- wtf?
[02:56] <jman2050> .
[02:58] <mrsolo_> man
[02:58] <mrsolo_> like wow.. they doing it wrong to balance the class
[02:59] <mrsolo_> we surviability is near zero
[02:59] <mrsolo_> it is really 1 vs 1 trade
[02:59] <mrsolo_> at best
[02:59] * pj has joined #GA
[03:00] <mrsolo_> too bad.. because class mechanic is better than wow rogue
[03:00] <Tre`> are they nerfing witch elves?
[03:00] <mrsolo_> ya
[03:00] <Tre`> or have they already?
[03:00] <mrsolo_> already done
[03:00] <mrsolo_> i think
[03:00] <Tre`> because it was pretty lol that witch elves could tear through a fucking ironbreaker
[03:00] <Tre`> their natural god damn nemesis
[03:01] <mrsolo_> hmm my we couldn't
[03:01] <mrsolo_> that was weeks back though
[03:01] <Takuan> Tre`: next patch i think, people are already crying
[03:01] <Tre`> oh yes, yes you could, originally
[03:01] <Tre`> I'm talking months ago
[03:01] <Tre`> like near launch
[03:01] <mrsolo_> ah
[03:01] <mrsolo_> i started we late..didn't see that
[03:01] <mrsolo_> so that that wasn't right
[03:01] <Lelielle> zombies are the new vampires
[03:01] <Tre`> one of the elixirs that pretty much nullified armor
[03:02] <Tre`> so you could DPS one down in seconds before it even wore off
[03:02] <mrsolo_> you know...ironbreaker has this..bash people down thing
[03:02] <mrsolo_> or 'be gone you bug' thing
[03:02] <Tre`> a fucking heavy armor melee class should not have to kite a light armor melee class
[03:02] <Sea_Manky> oh yeah, meatloaf is ready! :D
[03:02] <mrsolo_> generally when i played my we.. ib is a royal pain to deal with

[03:36] <WasabiKing> it's not that bad on PSN games except for rednecks and wiggers
[03:36] * DrForester has joined #GA
[03:36] <Takuan> not posisble
[03:36] <mrsolo_> takuan: well there is.. but hardly important you get them naturally
[03:36] <mrsolo_> just do pvp and when you ranked get that stuffs for tier 1
[03:36] <Takuan> what do you mean
[03:36] <mrsolo_> from tier 2 and on. just do some quests
[03:36] <mrsolo_> those are sufficient
[03:37] <Orin_Hamma> i tell ya man
[03:37] <Orin_Hamma> zangief is top tier
[03:37] <Takuan> what's tier 1 and 2
[03:37] <WasabiKing> orin you have sf iv?
[03:37] <minty> so is sagayt
[03:37] <mrsolo_> taier 1 is level 1-11, not the gear itself
[03:37] <mrsolo_> your toon's level
[03:37] <WasabiKing> sagat is awesome
[03:37] <Orin_Hamma> <mrsolo_> takuan: there is no gear to get
[03:37] <Orin_Hamma> wat
[03:37] <Takuan> fagat
[03:37] <minty> orinchan is waiting for teh pc ver
[03:37] <WasabiKing> boxer is cool too
[03:37] <WasabiKing> oh yeah
[03:38] <minty> so he can pirate it
[03:38] <darkh23> wooo ULTRA COMBO MASTER
[03:38] <darkh23> lolz
[03:38] <Orin_Hamma> you can get renown gear at the city takuan
[03:38] <WasabiKing> lol
[03:38] <mrsolo_> in gtheory there are gears..but not that important
[03:38] <WasabiKing> I need the super combo one
[03:38] <mrsolo_> ya renoun stuffs that's tier 4 and thing
[03:38] <mrsolo_> don't worry about it now
[03:38] * Orin_Hamma slaps mrsolo_ around a bit with a large trout
[03:38] <mrsolo_> grab an boomstick and jump in have fun
[03:38] <Orin_Hamma> there is tier 1 -4 renown gear
[03:38] <mrsolo_> you have lobster hand after all
[03:38] <mrsolo_> right
[03:39] <Orin_Hamma> everytime you go up a renown level you can check to see if you can buy anything
[03:39] <Orin_Hamma> or you can do quest and get gear
[03:39] * Garrett has joined #GA
[03:39] <Orin_Hamma> that usually sucks
[03:39] <mrsolo_> right
[03:39] <mrsolo_> not hard to do
[03:39] <mrsolo_> the thing is..bright wizard will toast you naked or otherwise.. does't matter :-)
[03:39] <Orin_Hamma> or you can get good gear by getting influence in the RVR zone, which takes forever
[03:39] <darkh23> wow I'm a lot better at QCF ultras now
[03:39] <darkh23> go go hrap
[03:39] <Nikashi> darkh23: I can at least buffer them well with a pad
[03:40] <mrsolo_> oh ya
[03:40] <mrsolo_> influence award
[03:40] <mrsolo_> still not hard to do
[03:40] <Orin_Hamma> personnally I just do RVR Instances and buy renown gear and do quest when nothings popping
[03:40] <mrsolo_> they make some difference..frankly not much of a difference
[03:40] <Orin_Hamma> i cant be bothered with Open RVR infuence
[03:40] <mrsolo_> i like this aspect better than wow
[03:40] <darkh23> I couldnt do them at all on a pad nik
[03:40] <mrsolo_> team play is more imortant
[03:40] <Orin_Hamma> i do love ORVR fights tho
[03:41] <Orin_Hamma> unless i have an idiot team who likes to attack tanks first
[03:41] * PopOnArrival has joined #GA
[03:41] <mrsolo_> but.. its iron blocker.. must attack midgets!
[03:41] * LeliDS has joined #GA
[03:42] <mrsolo_> dunno.. sometime it makes sense to attack tanks
[03:42] <mrsolo_> depend on the game i guess
[03:42] <mrsolo_> shadow warrior has this thing call acid arrow, very useful
[03:43] <mrsolo_> festering arrow very useful too
[03:43] <Orin_Hamma> i fucking had shadow Warriors
[03:43] <Orin_Hamma> so god dammed useless
[03:43] <mrsolo_> oh?
[03:43] <mrsolo_> play with with bad ones?
[03:44] <Orin_Hamma> every RVR battle, the team with the most archers always lose
[03:44] <Orin_Hamma> haha
[03:44] <mrsolo_> heh
[03:44] <Takuan> Shadow Warriors?
[03:44] <Takuan> Dork Elves?
[03:44] <mrsolo_> hmm
[03:44] <mrsolo_> no
[03:44] <Takuan> What they be?
[03:44] <mrsolo_> in your face elve
[03:44] <mrsolo_> go read up
[03:44] <Orin_Hamma> give me a nice amount of White Lions or Witch Elves and you tear shit up fast
[03:45] <mrsolo_> shadow warrior is hmm hybrid
[03:45] <mrsolo_> it has stances like wow warrior
[03:45] <mrsolo_> in generall a support class and kinda difficult to play right
[03:45] <Takuan> but what is it
[03:45] <mrsolo_> well in a way it is like druid
[03:45] <Orin_Hamma> Ranged DPS
[03:45] <Orin_Hamma> uses a Bow
[03:45] <mrsolo_> not really 
[03:45] <mrsolo_> not anynore
[03:46] <mrsolo_> it can dps nowdays
[03:46] <mrsolo_> melee i mean
[03:46] <Tiduz\`> wat
[03:46] <Tiduz\`>  Samuel L. Jackson signs on to play Nick Fury for NINE Marvel films!
[03:46] <mrsolo_> they change it awhile ago so range atrribute converts to strength when in assault stance now
[03:46] <Takuan> solo: what race is it?
[03:46] <mrsolo_> order, elf
[03:46] <Orin_Hamma> Sure shadow warrios can  meele, and get dropped in 3 seconds
[03:47] <mrsolo_> nope
[03:47] <Orin_Hamma> dude
[03:47] <Orin_Hamma> there armor is crap
[03:47] <mrsolo_> dude you need to get in the problem
[03:47] <mrsolo_> their armor is medium in assault
[03:47] <mrsolo_> same as others
[03:47] <mrsolo_> in the program that is
[03:47] <Orin_Hamma> Witch Elf VS Shawdow Warrior
[03:47] <Orin_Hamma> WE wins
[03:47] <Orin_Hamma> Maurader vs Shadow Warrior
[03:47] <mrsolo_> we loose against assault
[03:47] <Orin_Hamma> Maurader WIns
[03:47] <mrsolo_> wrong again
[03:47] <mrsolo_> that was true
[03:48] <mrsolo_> not anymore
[03:48] <Orin_Hamma> I dont know what game yer playing mrsolo
[03:48] <mrsolo_> the issue is..like druid.you have to spec into assault
[03:48] <Orin_Hamma> but Shadow Warriors aint designed for meele
[03:48] <mrsolo_> otherwise yes..they win
[03:48] <mrsolo_> no.. shadow warrios is designed as hybrid
[03:48] <mrsolo_> they can melee
[03:49] <mrsolo_> just not in scount/skirmish spec
[03:49] <mrsolo_> in fact assault spec, bow is there for..decoration haha
[03:49] <mrsolo_> basically bump debuff before jump into melee range
[03:49] <mrsolo_> pump that is

[04:19] <SanjuroTsubaki> however nothing worth talking about
[04:20] <SanjuroTsubaki> he is a great director who should be stripped of all writing duties and executive decisions

[04:21] <jett> i think michael bay is entirely worthless
[04:21] <jett> to me

[05:47] <Lemurs> the first time I brought a check in when i opened the account they cashed it
[05:47] <thesoapster> no trip to the bank
[05:47] <Lemurs> and they baited and switched.

[05:47] <Lemurs> When I closed it the asshole made a comment about my amount of money i had in the account.
[05:47] <Lemurs> One day I saw his boss at the bank and told him.

[05:48] <Lemurs> told him.
[05:48] <TheOMan> What a jackass.
[05:49] <Lemurs> Then a while later I came back and his picture was removed from the BANK DIRECTOR thing
[05:49] <NinSoX> Is there any way to get unbanned from a perm ban? I learned my lesson
[05:49] <Lemurs> replaced with some other person

[06:00] <Lemurs> http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v491/omg_platypus/StratCaseFrontWhole.jpg
[06:00] <duckroll> i heard KZ2 is headed to the 360

[06:00] <jett> don't forget the iphone
[06:00] <jett> the wii version would get an iphone port
[06:00] <duckroll> no
[06:01] <Lemurs> The EJ strat is the first Strat I ever played with an open mind.
[06:01] <duckroll> the iphone one is a puzzle game
[06:01] <Lemurs> I used to hate strats.
[06:01] <duckroll> its different
[06:01] <Lemurs> I was a dumb little kid.
[06:01] <duckroll> its like whack the mole
[06:01] <Kagari> KILLZONE TOUCH
[06:01] <Lemurs> 12 or 13.
[06:01] <Y2Kev> FML @ top chef
[06:01] <duckroll> except you whack Helghast heads
[06:01] <NinSoX> he also said the Halo ODST team was grouped specifically to make a game that looks better than K2

[06:02] <minty> haha
[06:03] <jett> if i'm lucky i may get it this weekend
[06:03] <jett> if not, bleh
[06:03] <NinSoX> i've not been following k2. i expect to be blown away this friday
[06:04] <duckroll> jett: lol
[06:04] <duckroll> my plan is to unlock the medic and engineer by the time you fuckers come online

[06:05] <warcock> yeah
[06:05] <jett> well that's dumb
[06:05] <duckroll> he said when they tested it internally, all classes are unlocked
[06:05] <duckroll> so no one noticed a "problem"
[06:05] <duckroll> lololol
[06:05] <jett> took me like 30 hours to unlock the sniper
[06:05] <LeliTDS> tom selleck on daily show, wow
[06:06] <duckroll> the bastard started working on the grind once the servers went online
[06:06] <jett> those fuckng idiots
[06:06] <LeliTDS> wonder what he's up to
[06:06] <NinSoX> that's going to cause some unbalanced matches
[06:06] <duckroll> its worse than CoD4
[06:06] <duckroll> but when you get high enough its really fun
[06:06] <Lemurs> takuan
[06:06] <Lemurs> transparent white
[06:06] <Lemurs> best finishe ver
[06:07] <minty> oh wait, worse than cod4? gaw
[06:07] <jett> ninsox: nah not really it was pretty balanced still
[06:07] <jett> the regular rifle is great
[06:07] <minty> i don't like to grind just to get some lousy weapons
[06:07] <duckroll> i think its less of a balance issue and more of a fun factor issue
[06:07] <duckroll> the bottom line is not that you can't win, but classes are just MORE FUN
[06:08] <jett> to be honest i didn't like the sniper class as much as i thought i would
[06:08] <NinSoX> grind and sell your K2 accounts
[06:08] <duckroll> although, it could be a balance issue if all the engineers end up on one side in certain maps though

[06:20] <SanjuroTsubaki> all he will do here is eddie house's job
[06:20] <SanjuroTsubaki> and house sucks

[07:19] <BossG> heh, if i had any time for gaming, I would like to own a force feedback racing wheel, and a couple of joysticks for fighting games...nothing but a dream now though
[07:19] <BossG> heh, for that game, all you would need a wii remote...
[07:19] * jakehk has joined #GA
[07:19] <bjork-SEGA> so I helped the boss move the liquor from his restaurant
[07:20] <LeliTDS> well to have the pull that a firehose would, but much less
[07:20] <bjork-SEGA> probably $60,000 worth
[07:20] * bjork-SEGA sore
[07:20] <LeliTDS> ow
[07:20] <GaimeGuy> that's a lot of liquor
[07:24] <Nikashi> Did you pocket any
[07:25] <bjork-SEGA> nah
[07:25] <bjork-SEGA> I don't drink
[07:26] <bjork-SEGA> but he's got tons of shit, it's ridiculous
[07:26] <bjork-SEGA> maybe it's more than $60k
[07:26] * Bob_Coffee has joined #GA
[07:26] <bjork-SEGA> 1000 bottles of wine

[07:30] <BossG> listening to random idiots
[07:31] <BossG> with their ugly ass faces on my screen
[07:31] <BossG> back that goddamn camera up...
[07:31] <nerbo> twitter is only cool if you know/keep in touch with a group for a particular purpose
[07:31] <nerbo> when twitter is used like a purposed, group SMS service, it's pretty cool
[07:32] <Nikashi> Someone needs to send political cartoonists an open memo
[07:32] <Nikashi> "LIST OF ANIMALS YOU CAN NO LONGER MAKE COMPARISON TO THE CURRENT BLACK PRESIDENT"
[07:32] <BossG> lol...that shit is common sense, but they don't get it.
[07:32] <nerbo> nah, they get it
[07:32] <Nikashi> 1. MONKEYS ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE
[07:33] <nerbo> they're generating conroversy
[07:33] <Nikashi> Yes we know our last president was a moron monkey face
[07:33] <Nikashi> but he was white so it's ok
[07:33] <nerbo> i.e. selling papers/pageviews
[07:33] <Nikashi> and he did have a face like a chimp

[07:33] * Garrett has joined #GA
[07:34] <bjork-SEGA> instead of sending cartoonists a memo
[07:34] <BossG> heh, I doubt it's just as innocent as generating controversy, there's some deep seated hatred that they can't keep under wraps
[07:34] <bjork-SEGA> how about sending pussyasses like Al Sharpton a letter bomb
[07:34] <bjork-SEGA> you've milked the victim shtick for like 60 years, give it a rest
[07:35] * Danj_sleep is now known as Danj
[07:35] <Nikashi> BossG: They haven't been able to say 'HNIC' and it kills them
[07:35] <Danj> morning all
[07:35] <BossG> white folk subscribe to negative stereotypes about blacks every day, I've seen it myself, and i have to get in the ass of somebody, for instance, calling Tony Dungy lazy for retiring at the age of 57, from football....
[07:35] <bjork-SEGA> then we can back to real business. Like DC2 being the reason the world economy will improve
[07:35] <Nikashi> "THE JOKE IS RIGHT THERE PLEASE LET US MAKE IT ONCE"
[07:35] <BossG> can't think of a better word than lazy...stupid ass rednecks
[07:35] <BossG> but telling, imo
[07:36] <LeliTDS> then theres ironic hipster racism
[07:36] <Bob_Coffee> the DC2 will save earth from alien invasion!
[07:36] <bjork-SEGA> why are white people automatically rednecks
[07:36] <BossG> the audacity of some folks who think they have the benefit of the doubt to say some shit like that...
[07:36] <Nikashi> BossG: I do my best not to fall victim to prejudices, but i still have that stupid  'oh hey a black guy oh fuck I hope he doesn't think I'm some redneck asshat oh fuck he's looking at me, what do I do' fucking retardedness
[07:36] <bjork-SEGA> I don't
[07:36] <Bob_Coffee> and it'll revive the awe inspring force of Segata Sanshiro. the reason the DC lost, is they lacked Segata's guidence!
[07:37] <bjork-SEGA> I have that "that guy thinks I'm a bigot and that makes him a bigot himself"
[07:37] <Nikashi> And I know that he's going
[07:37] <bjork-SEGA> then I end up being the coolest guy he met all day, so we end up being friendly
[07:37] <Nikashi> "Why the fuck is that white guy all nervous, fucking racist"
[07:38] <LeliTDS> we internalize all kinds of bad stuff
[07:38] <bjork-SEGA> the return no one asked for:
[07:38] <bjork-SEGA> Former WCW wrestler Van Hammer is coming out of retirement for a match against Champ Champagne at Maryland Championship Wrestling’s “Xtreme Measures” show on April 11, reports Kevin Eck of The Baltimore Sun.
[07:38] <HadesGigas> haha Van Hammer
[07:38] <bjork-SEGA> and what in the hell is a champ champagne
[07:38] <bjork-SEGA> sounds like some d-grade rapper
[07:39] <LeliTDS> or a lounge singer
[07:39] <HadesGigas> He's no Chris Champagne Kanyon
[07:39] <Nikashi> who better than kanyon

[07:40] <bjork-SEGA> pat patterson what
[07:40] <Shinobi_ShamWow> diamond dallas kanyon
[07:40] <HadesGigas> except they were pretend queer, and he is real queer (or claims to be)

[07:40] <Nikashi> HadesGigas: Yeah well I never beleve anything in wrestling

[07:42] <Nikashi> to a high school party it seems
[07:42] <LeliTDS> I  used to be amazed by super shammies as a kid
[07:42] <BossG> bjork, fyi, I don't lump in rednecks and internet nerds together...these folks I was talking about are country bumpkins saying some stupid shit
[07:42] <bjork-SEGA> I said white people
[07:43] <Nikashi> BossG: I just try to be aware of my dumb shit and not do it
[07:43] * Bob_Coffee has joined #GA
[07:43] <LeliTDS> there are fauxgressives,
[07:43] <Nikashi> but I don't hold too many negative racial views anyways it's all just white guilt lol
[07:43] <bjork-SEGA> or is that the black equivalent of "not all blacks are n-words, honest"
[07:43] <SanjuroTsubaki> I like to think I'm diverse
[07:43] <bjork-SEGA> yawn
[07:43] <bjork-SEGA> people are people
[07:43] <SanjuroTsubaki> I get a taquito from 7/11 once every 2 months
[07:44] <Nikashi> Yeah but we still shouldn't ignore the fact we're a bit different, but they're superficial differences that don't matter
[07:44] <bjork-SEGA> everyone's different
[07:44] <bjork-SEGA> everyone is unique like being a very special snowflake
[07:44] * bjork-SEGA vomit
[07:44] <Nikashi> but people who say they don't see race are LYING
[07:44] <avcables> lol snowflake
[07:44] <Nikashi> they see it and choose not to acknowledge it sure
[07:44] <HadesGigas> Stephen Colbert is not a liar
[07:44] <bjork-SEGA> race is a way to push people's buttons
[07:44] <bjork-SEGA> that's all
[07:45] <Nikashi> HadesGigas: Oh go play more Senko no Ronde
[07:45] <Nikashi> I bet you pick Ciullan
[07:45] <Nikashi> pedo
[07:45] <SanjuroTsubaki> if i saw a bunch of white kids wearing AE shirts and such in front of my house in comparison to a bunch of black kids wearing thug wear....yeah I would sterotype
[07:45] <HadesGigas> I made the mistake of picking either her or that other one when i first played it
[07:45] <Nikashi> um
[07:45] <Nikashi> Ciullan is not a her
[07:45] <Nikashi> it's a hi
[07:45] <Nikashi> him
[07:45] <Nikashi> Shota 
[07:45] <HadesGigas> then got to their super impossible end boss and thought it was the regular end boss
[07:45] <Tony_Parker> Clips/Celtics 84 all
[07:45] <Nikashi> not loli
[07:45] <HadesGigas> oh then maybe i mean someone else? i dunno their names
[07:46] <Nikashi> ... you'd remember the boy that's dressed like a girl
[07:46] <HadesGigas> two of them have that giant squid thing as an end boss

[07:47] <HadesGigas> also i have no idea what the plot of that game is about, reading during the middle of a shump, great idea
[07:48] <SanjuroTsubaki> sort of boy
[07:48] <Nikashi> Android in drag
[07:48] <BossG> boyish looking girl if I had to guess
[07:48] <Nikashi> no
[07:48] <HadesGigas> all i know is that all the endings make it seem like everyone fails and are miserable 
[07:48] <Nikashi> it's a boy
[07:48] <Nikashi> even says so in the manual
[07:48] <Nikashi> and in the game text lol
[07:49] <bjork-SEGA> that's a boy?
[07:49] <SanjuroTsubaki> i suck at SF4 trial mode
[07:49] <Nikashi> Yes
[07:49] <bjork-SEGA> is it son of bridget from GG
[07:49] <Nikashi> and why are you surprised bjork
[07:49] <bjork-SEGA> I don't play some fruity mech shit
[07:49] <BossG> it's all brownhole to him
[07:49] <bjork-SEGA> so I'd have no way of knowing
[07:49] <Nikashi> but yeah that's a more conservative outfit than in the game
[07:49] <Nikashi> it's not mech shit
[07:49] <bjork-SEGA> yeah, exactly
[07:49] <Nikashi> it's danmaku vs fighting
[07:49] <bjork-SEGA> yawn
[07:50] <BossG> as long as there something to stick your dick into, right? :)

[07:51] <Tony_Parker> man this game is all types of awesome
[07:51] <Tony_Parker> one of the best teams vs. one of the worst 
[07:51] <BossG> safe to say, that does not give me a boner
[07:51] <HadesGigas> hmm looks like the first person i played as was Enrula
[07:52] <bjork-SEGA> hey, when you get a boner, do your nipples get hard?
[07:52] <HadesGigas> since i couldn't beat the end boss so settled for beating score attack instead
[07:52] <bjork-SEGA> cause mine don't, and apparently they're supposed to
[07:52] <HadesGigas> then didn't play it again for like a year
[07:52] <HadesGigas> er Ernula*

[07:59] <SanjuroTsubaki> from the flea market
[07:59] <bjork-SEGA> that other shit is ok
[08:00] <HadesGigas> star trek doesn't screem white trash to me
[08:00] <bjork-SEGA> yeah
[08:00] <SanjuroTsubaki> well maybe something else
[08:00] <bjork-SEGA> star trek screams shut-in more than anything
[08:00] <HadesGigas> white nerrrrrrd, yes
[08:00] <bjork-SEGA> wrasslin shirts all depends on who you have
[08:00] <SanjuroTsubaki> well my flea market consists of those things
[08:00] <bjork-SEGA> if you have like a 619 shirt, get cancer
[08:00] <SanjuroTsubaki> not just star trek
[08:00] <SanjuroTsubaki> but boxed figures
[08:01] <SanjuroTsubaki> i don't have any of those things lol
[08:01] <SanjuroTsubaki> i always wanted a wrestling shirt when i was younger
[08:01] <SanjuroTsubaki> but never got one
[08:01] <bjork-SEGA> I had a bret hart shirt
[08:01] <SanjuroTsubaki> now they all are pretty lame
[08:01] <SanjuroTsubaki> unless it is a hulkamania shirt
[08:01] <bjork-SEGA> hulk is old hat
[08:01] <bjork-SEGA> macho man is the new retro hotness
[08:02] <SanjuroTsubaki> he needs to come back
[08:02] <SanjuroTsubaki> i'm debating going to raw next week
[08:02] <bjork-SEGA> can't
[08:02] <bjork-SEGA> he fingered SMH when she was 14 or some shit
[08:02] <SanjuroTsubaki> i haven't gone to a wwe event since wm14
[08:02] <SanjuroTsubaki> yeahyeah
[08:03] <SanjuroTsubaki> vince cares more about money than a vendetta
[08:03] <bjork-SEGA> doubtful
[08:03] <SanjuroTsubaki> him and hogan would draw bigger card than anyone they have now
[08:03] <bjork-SEGA> no
[08:03] <SanjuroTsubaki> unless a current superstar dies
[08:03] <SanjuroTsubaki> then the raw will do well
[08:03] <bjork-SEGA> hogan's not the draw he was even a few years ago
[08:03] <SanjuroTsubaki> more so than their current roster
[08:03] <SanjuroTsubaki> not as big, no
[08:04] <SanjuroTsubaki> i watch more when he is around
[08:04] <bjork-SEGA> you underestimate
[08:04] <bjork-SEGA> but will you drop $40 on a ppv?
[08:04] <bjork-SEGA> do you go buy the figures and shirts?
[08:04] <SanjuroTsubaki> last time i did he headlined it
[08:04] <bjork-SEGA> er... $49 now, I guess
[08:04] <SanjuroTsubaki> ill buy a shirt

[14:18] <EviLore> hrm, I just read the first two issues of Girls (luna brothers).  hrm.  kiiinda felt like it could be veering towards bad anime 13 year old wish fulfillment crap, but it's throwing curve balls.  dunno.  art is nice.  will have to pir8 a little more before I decide I guess.

[14:21] <dead> elephantmen is suprisingly cool
[14:21] <dead> blade runner meets pachyderms
[14:22] <BossG> though I am really trying to avoid most miniseries, if I can be assured of a tpb collection of it.
[14:23] <BossG> some publishers, like boom! studios and IDW jump in quickly with the collections, and those two have the audacity to charge 3.99$ for a single comic...makes it easier to wait

[14:24] <OsgXafk> I was sure mine was going to connect and dan's connected
[14:24] <OsgXafk> lol
[14:24] <Nikashi> OsgXafk: I no longer fear your Boxer :D
[14:24] * OsgXafk is now known as Oldschoolgamer
[14:24] <Oldschoolgamer> don't worry. I'll upgrade it
[14:24] <Nikashi> Everyone asks me how I got sakura in her gym outfit
[14:24] <Oldschoolgamer> :)
[14:24] <Nikashi> lol
[14:24] <Nikashi> it's color 10
[14:25] <Oldschoolgamer> i can't play sakura at all
[14:25] <Nikashi> I am ok with her
[14:25] <Oldschoolgamer> LOL @ Sagat
[14:25] <Oldschoolgamer> roundhouse for victory
[14:25] <Oldschoolgamer> that beat out everything you did with Rufus
[14:25] <Oldschoolgamer> his kick has crazy priority over stuff
[14:25] <Oldschoolgamer> o_O
[14:26] <Nikashi> that was literally my first time playing him competitively
[14:26] <Oldschoolgamer> mine with sagat
[14:26] <Nikashi> Yeah but you knew his moves
[14:26] <Oldschoolgamer> from super turbo
[14:26] <Oldschoolgamer> lolol
[14:26] <Nikashi> yeah which are all the same
[14:27] <Nikashi> except easier knee
[14:27] <Nikashi> sakura was all beat up
[14:27] <Oldschoolgamer> your rose shut down my bison. :(
[14:27] <Nikashi> I noticed that
[14:27] <Nikashi> lol
[14:27] <Nikashi> haha
[14:27] <Nikashi> my dan shut down everyone
[14:27] <Oldschoolgamer> cept boxer
[14:27] <Nikashi> dude
[14:27] <Nikashi> last game was a shutout
[14:27] <Oldschoolgamer> that ultra though
[14:27] <Nikashi> hehe
[14:27] <Oldschoolgamer> what the hell
[14:27] <Nikashi> 3 wins to 0
[14:27] <Nikashi> Dan's ultra has massive massive priority
[14:28] <Nikashi> over everything
[14:28] <Nikashi> goes through everything
[14:28] <Oldschoolgamer> I'm not going to be able to get over that. It's like something you would see in a versus game
[14:28] <Nikashi> I can ultra into a raging demon
[14:28] <Nikashi> and I'll hit
[14:28] <Nikashi> hehe
[14:28] <Nikashi> I did that to your Akuma too didn't I
[14:28] <Oldschoolgamer> my akuma is scrubby
[14:28] <Nikashi> Mine raeped yours
[14:28] <Nikashi> lol
[14:28] <Oldschoolgamer> did enough to take down gouken
[14:28] <Nikashi> and actually hit a raging demon
[14:28] <Nikashi> gasp
[14:28] <Oldschoolgamer> yeaaaa
[14:29] <Oldschoolgamer> I dunno what I was thinking ducking there
[14:29] <Oldschoolgamer> lol
[14:29] <Nikashi> hehe
[14:29] <Oldschoolgamer> i need to fight cammy more
[14:29] <Oldschoolgamer> she is annoying

[14:29] <Oldschoolgamer> yep. :(
[14:29] <Oldschoolgamer> meanie
[14:29] <Oldschoolgamer> :(
[14:29] <Nikashi> dan is allowed ot taunt tho
[14:29] <Nikashi> did you like the different taunts I got?
[14:30] <Oldschoolgamer> ya
[14:30] <Nikashi> I like the one where he stands on one foot
[14:30] <Nikashi> and just kinda gets bored
[14:30] <Oldschoolgamer> I need to get some for boxer.
[14:30] <Nikashi> they're easy to get
[14:30] <Nikashi> survival and timetrial normal
[14:30] <Oldschoolgamer> how?
[14:30] <Oldschoolgamer> ah. okay.
[14:30] <Nikashi> that's it
[14:30] <Nikashi> gets you all the colors and personal actions I think
[14:30] <Nikashi> because I noticed I got all the ven ones when I only did survival normal
[14:31] <Nikashi> but having more taunts is an awesome feature
[14:31] <Oldschoolgamer> cool. I haven't done those yet
[14:31] <Nikashi> and now I can ogle the girls more
[14:31] <Oldschoolgamer> lolol
[14:31] <Nikashi> because they have sluttier outfits
[14:31] <Oldschoolgamer> chun li. Why do I want to play her like she's in third strike.... :/

[14:33] <Oldschoolgamer> everytime I would get 5 away
[14:33] <Oldschoolgamer> i'd fuck up
[14:33] <Oldschoolgamer> lol
[14:33] <BudokaiMR2> are you both on the dpad?
[14:33] <Nikashi> I am 
[14:33] <Oldschoolgamer> yes
[14:33] <Nikashi> And we're playing 5 rounds
[14:33] <BudokaiMR2> how the hell does that work
[14:33] <Nikashi> so avoid flukeouts
[14:33] <BudokaiMR2> like seriously
[14:33] <Nikashi> BudokaiMR2: I modded my d pad
[14:33] <Oldschoolgamer> it SUCKS
[14:34] <Oldschoolgamer> mine isn't modded
[14:34] <Oldschoolgamer> :/
[14:34] <Nikashi> so it's responsive enough to not be horrible
[14:34] <BudokaiMR2> that dpad doesnt even work for fucking weapon changing
[14:34] <BudokaiMR2> like in oblivion
[14:34] <Nikashi> I filed down the sides
[14:34] <BudokaiMR2> trying to change skills and shit
[14:34] <Nikashi> works 10x better now
[14:34] <Oldschoolgamer> i need to mod mine. I was fucking up on buffalo headbutts 
[14:34] <Oldschoolgamer> or whatever
[14:34] <BudokaiMR2> i <3 my stick
[14:34] <Nikashi> I am getting a stick eventually
[14:34] <Oldschoolgamer> me too
[14:34] <Nikashi> but I can still play adaquately on a pad in the meantime 
[14:34] <BudokaiMR2> i like the HRAP3 a lot
[14:34] <Nikashi> I can't FADC in a combo but I can do it during a match
[14:34] <BudokaiMR2> i switched out the buttons because hori aren't my style
[14:35] <Nikashi> To fake out
[14:35] <Oldschoolgamer> i can't fadc into boxer's ultra
[14:35] <Oldschoolgamer> :/
[14:35] <BudokaiMR2> FADC is hard in combos
[14:35] <Nikashi> I can usually FA into dan's ultra
[14:35] <BudokaiMR2> i can do it in other times
[14:35] <Nikashi> hitting it more frequently
[14:35] <BudokaiMR2> but i cant do the EX version in matches
[14:35] <Nikashi> I ex focus attack to ex gale kick sometimes
[14:35] <Nikashi> out of dans' standing kick
[14:35] <Nikashi> For the reconrd
[14:36] <Nikashi> record*
[14:36] <Nikashi> I was stoned out of my mind
[14:36] <Nikashi> so that's how I play when stoned

[00:18] <Magus> i swear rhytm game don't work with the normal wiimote :/
[00:18] <Gattsu25> because it's not needed
[00:18] <Magus> it's not that hard to understand
[00:19] <Eric> wonder if samba would have worked if it had motion plus
[00:19] <Gattsu25> rhythm games don't work on the Wii.  Wiimote+ won't change that
[00:19] <Magus> gatsu - samba de amigo could have benefited a lot from it,if it just detected the height instead of the inclination
[00:19] <Tre`> motion plus doesn't immediately don't make the wiimote not a laggy piece of shit

[00:24] <Gattsu25> it's amazing how freaking jaw dropping the patterns are

[00:25] <Magus> that would be bad

[00:26] <Maxrpg> i can't play 12 because I have an HDTV and FF12 look like ASS
[00:26] <Gattsu25> Magus, I sorta agree with you when it comes to MMOs
[00:26] <Tiduz\`> 12 is horrible.
[00:27] <Tiduz\`> FFXIII is FFX in HD almost
[00:27] <Tiduz\`> do want
[00:27] <Maxrpg> do want
[00:27] <Gattsu25> they start off fun and the enjoyment tapers off as the time between levels increases
[00:27] * Propagandhim has joined #GA
[00:28] <Gattsu25> but I enjoyed the rigid nature of FFXI
[00:28] <Shuri> i think the last ff game i enjoyed was ff4
[00:28] <jett\awesomecharted> eric: seems you can actually put your make-up on wrong or something
[00:28] <jett\awesomecharted> too much lipstick
[00:28] <Shuri> when it came out, i was straight in the target demographic
[00:28] <Gattsu25> (not the rigid requirements of the players, mind you)
[00:28] <Propagandhim> was hoping for a new handheld :(
[00:28] <Gattsu25> I loved that a group had to have great synergy or they would suffer
[00:28] <jett\awesomecharted> tiduz: you better get ready for gambits
[00:28] <jett\awesomecharted> they're totally coming back
[00:29] <Gattsu25> and I loved how the game actively punished bad players
[00:29] <Gattsu25> jett: nothing new
[00:30] <Gattsu25> all the best RPGs have 'gambitsof some sort
[00:31] <jett\awesomecharted> o rly
[00:31] <Gattsu25> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=16134796&postcount=1    <--  Holy shit is that thing ugly
[00:31] <Gattsu25> yes
[00:31] <Gattsu25> they used to call them AI scripts
[00:32] <Jide> probably old but - http://cerberus.mirror.waffleimages.com/files/52/52be62221a8a6ede6571b056ea64bfa399eebddb.jpg - LOL
[00:33] <jett\awesomecharted> lol...
[00:33] * Propagandhim has quit IRC (Quit: )
[00:34] <Tiduz\`> jett\awesomecharted: Gambits = no sale
[00:34] <Gattsu25> IWD2 and BG2 shit on all your FFs and DQs
[00:35] <Magus> meh
[00:36] <Tiduz\`> wtf is iwd2
[00:36] <Magus> my experience with black island rpg basicaly amount to being bored and frustated by the original baldur's gate
[00:36] <Acosta> icewind dale 2
[00:36] <Magus> and then i never got another chance to play another one
[00:36] <Tiduz\`> oh
[00:36] <Gattsu25> Baldur's Gate is Bioware
[00:36] <Gattsu25> not Black Isle
[00:36] <Magus> you sure?
[00:36] <Gattsu25> you check for me
[00:37] <mrsolo>  bg1, bg2 expansions were fun
[00:37] <Gattsu25> people who are wrong should do their own work, me says
[00:37] <mrsolo> bug dang..those games are ancient now
[00:37] <Magus> Black Isle Studios is most famous for working on the Fallout and Baldur's Gate series of computer role-playing games, though it only published the Baldur's Gate series.
[00:37] * Dimmuxx has joined #GA
[00:37] <Magus> ah-ah!
[00:37] <Magus> i win
[00:37] <Magus> o/
[00:38] <Gattsu25> old games, sure...but they've advanced farther than jRPGs that are still stuck between Ultima I and Ultima II
[00:38] <Magus> eh who cares
[00:38] <itsgreen> lol FF14: See, they'd like to clarify yesterday's announcement that the game was "exclusive" to the PS3. It's not. There'll also be a PC version. Following that, however, a carefully-worded statement said "in terms of all other hardware, including Microsoft consoles, we are considering all other options at this time".
[00:38] <Magus> i'd rather have something i enjoy than just wawing "MY GAME IS ADVANCED BECAUSE I CAN KICK KITTENS"
[00:39] <Magus> "OH AND NO RANDOM TURNED BATTLE,THOSE SUCKS"
[00:39] <mrsolo> ya.. who wants our cheese burger to evolve!
[00:39] <Magus> (turn based)
[00:39] <mrsolo> cheese burger is a cheese burge! good is one is still good!
[00:39] <Magus> mrsolo - bacon burger > cheese burger
[00:39] <Gattsu25> and I'd rather kick kittens than play as another spiky haired anime kid off to save the world
[00:40] <Magus> i'm happy for you then ^_^
[00:40] <mrsolo> beside  isn't jrpg dying in u.s.? haven't seen a major one lately
[00:40] <mrsolo> person 4 is hardly major...
[00:40] <mrsolo> persona
[00:40] <mrsolo> ...
[00:40] <Magus> eeehhh the one who did the big stuff was square
[00:40] <Magus> and she's too busy wanking over FF13
[00:40] <Magus> so we are basicaly screwed :/
[00:41] <Gattsu25> square's output in the past, while better than it is now...never really was that great
[00:41] <Gattsu25> actually, I take that back
[00:41] <Magus> square output was legendary
[00:41] <mrsolo> what happen to dragon quest hmm?
[00:42] <Magus> mrsolo - on ds!
[00:42] <mrsolo>   psff
[00:42] <Magus> then maybe we get one on the wii
[00:42] <Gattsu25> Square's SNES output never really appealed to me
[00:42] <Magus> but the wii suxors
[00:42] <Magus> gatsu - aim higher
[00:42] <Gattsu25> I don't even like Chrono Trigger, and that's supposedly a top-tier game
[00:42] <Maxrpg> bacon burger mmmmm
[00:42] <Magus> i'm talking about PSX
[00:42] <Magus> you have no soul gatsu :/
[00:43] <Magus> NO SOUL
[00:43] * Magus goes to cry
[00:43] <mrsolo> hmm dq is q4 09 or later
[00:43] <mrsolo> geez
[00:43] <mrsolo> talk about dry spell
[00:43] <Gattsu25> PSX saw FF9 and Vagrant Story
[00:43] <Gattsu25> first was okay and I really enjoyed VS
[00:43] <Magus> and FF7 and xenogear and parasite eve and brave fencer musashi and suikoden and lunar silver star story
[00:43] <Magus> those were the good times :/
[00:43] <Gattsu25> umm....Einhander was nice (fuck the spelling, I'm talking about that shooter)
[00:43] <Magus> now all we get are atlus game which i never seems to enjoy
[00:43] <mrsolo> vs is like wet dream for control freak
[00:44] <Gattsu25> FF7 was overrated
[00:44] <mrsolo> gattsu25: are you a control freak?
[00:44] <Gattsu25> Xeno* is shit
[00:44] <Gattsu25> never played PE and I enjoyed brave fencer but it went on for too long
[00:44] <Gattsu25> sorta
[00:44] <mrsolo> einh* is nice
[00:44] <mrsolo> sort
[00:44] <mrsolo> short, even for a shooter
[00:45] <Gattsu25> If a game is going to 'hardcore', it might as well go all the way...which is why I enjoyed Vagrant Story
[00:45] <Magus> for being shit xenogear got tons of work behind it,i don't think there was a ps2 game that got half the work behind it
[00:45] <Magus> ppfftt
[00:45] <Magus> vagrant story
[00:45] <Magus> I'M PINGING BOSS FOR 1 POINT OF DAMAGE!
[00:45] <Magus> THIS IS SO AWESOME!
[00:45] <mrsolo> what weapon? which hand? oh my? can't decide!
[00:45] <Gattsu25> who cares?  DNF had a lot of work behind it and it still ended up as a cancelled vaporware title that looked like it wouldn't have been any fun
[00:46] <Jide> yeah 21.31 21.32 lol !!!
[00:46] <mrsolo> so for xenogear
[00:46] <mrsolo> as for xenogear
[00:46] <mrsolo> i dunno.. didn't finish it myself
[00:46] <mrsolo> got really bored midway through
[00:47] <Gattsu25> Magus: funny how everyone who hated VS states that they do 1 damage against bosses...like admitting that you don't understand the weapon system is a good way of degrading the quality of a title
[00:47] <Magus> i finished it but i can't really remember much about the ending except that it had naked people and that it was very similiar to lunar ending
[00:47] <Magus> gatsu - i finished vagrant story
[00:47] <Magus> i can understand the weapon system all i want,i just end up bashing tons of lizard everytime i have to defeat a dragon
[00:48] <Magus> and there is no way to play with your weapon system against the final boss
[00:48] <Gattsu25> I liked how Xenogears had jumping puzzles, unique concept for an RPG...that's all I can say that's positive though
[00:48] <Magus> in fact it's no surprise that you get damage skill that ignore EVERYTHING
[00:48] <Magus> god bless those or else you would never get anywhere
[00:48] <Gattsu25> Xenosaga, on the other hand, had NOTHING going for it
[00:50] <mrsolo> see.. all those games
[00:50] <mrsolo> they are ps2
[00:50] <mrsolo> not ps3!
[00:50] <mrsolo> this console generation is a total lost
[00:50] <Magus> WAGGLE DESTROYED EVERYTHING
[00:50] <jake3hk> sugar ray leonard at e3 pimpin fn4
[00:50] <Magus> I AM APOWAGLYSE DESTROYER OF CONSOLES
[00:50] <Gattsu25> waggle, outside of boom blox, just has never been enjoyable
[00:51] <Magus> eh you are soooooo wrong
[00:51] <mrsolo> jrpg has nothing to show for this generation
[00:51] <mrsolo> sad
[00:51] <Magus> mrsolo - square got fucked
[00:51] <Magus> konami got fucked
[00:51] <Gattsu25> flower was fun...but only due to the aesthetic of the game...the controls could have been done on an analog controller and worked as well, IMO
[00:51] <Magus> you leave those two and you get nothing...
[00:51] <mrsolo> altus
[00:51] <mrsolo> don't forget altus!
[00:52] <Magus> i don't like atlus game and they keep making PS2 games recycling everything they can :/
[00:52] <Gattsu25> atlus is just about the only jRPG house worth watching, nowadays
[00:52] <Magus> i'd rather pick N1 game
[00:52] <Maxrpg> xseeeeed
[00:52] <Magus> xseed is a publisher ^_^'
[00:53] <Eric> marvelous then
[00:53] <Gattsu25> N1...N1...hmm...what do they make?
[00:53] <Nikashi> Hello all
[00:53] <Gattsu25> yo
[00:53] <Lelielle> http://i143.photobucket.com/albums/r155/Cleinhun/DSCN1041.jpg?t=1221269823  -lol silly

[00:53] <Kabouter> http://www.cepr.net/images/stories/report_images/psd-figure-1.jpg
[00:54] <TEEEPO> sick
[00:55] <Kabouter> It's why the US is #1 really, all those socialist states are weak
[00:55] <Lelielle> lol
[00:55] <mrsolo> so ya my next rpg will be...
[00:55] <mrsolo> whatever blizzard pumps out
[00:55] <Kabouter> I mean, Luxembourg GDP is only like 110k/capita
[00:56] <Lelielle> work life balance ftw
[00:56] * tsef has joined #GA
[00:56] <Kabouter> And Norway only has 95k
[00:56] <Kabouter> Damn pooros
[00:56] <KimiNewt> hahahaha
[00:56] <KimiNewt> holy shit
[00:56] <KimiNewt> worst day ever for my sim
[00:57] <mrsolo> didn't get laid?
[00:57] <KimiNewt> they're having a birthday party for their baby, they're blowing the candles and suddenly - FIRE
[00:57] <Magus> mrsolo - knights in the nightmare
[00:57] <KimiNewt> the mother and child are in flames
[00:57] <KimiNewt> mother dies
[00:57] <Magus> altough it has a 50% chance of sucking
[00:57] <KimiNewt> cake burns
[00:57] <mrsolo> 50% sucking or no game
[00:57] <mrsolo> i take 50%
[00:57] <Kabouter> Yeah, the cake burning is really terrible KimiNewt
[00:58] <KimiNewt> it was hilarious because it happened in second
[00:58] <Kabouter> Clearly on par with the mother burning to death
[00:58] <KimiNewt> also did you see the "Fire" moodlet
[00:58] <Kabouter> No, I've only had a fire once
[00:58] <Kabouter> When I forgot to take something out of the stove
[00:58] <KimiNewt> "Contrary to popular belief being on fire is not healthy" or some such
[00:58] <KimiNewt> well it happened to me thrice
[00:58] <KimiNewt> once someone died
[00:58] <KimiNewt> I saved beforehand though
[00:59] <KimiNewt> you get -200 mood while on fire
[00:59] <KimiNewt> there's an option to run to the shower and turn yourself off
[00:59] <KimiNewt> but she was carrying her child and it wouldn't let me put him down
[00:59] <Magus> murderer! :O
[01:00] <KimiNewt> It wasn't on purpose for once
[01:00] <KimiNewt> the baby just lay on the floor next to his mother's remains
[01:00] <KimiNewt> it was funny because the only option was "Clean up
[01:00] <KimiNewt> http://i43.tinypic.com/20krhck.jpg
[01:01] <Orbi> ...how many candles were there to actually start a fire?
[01:01] <KimiNewt> 1
[01:01] <Kabouter> Haha awesome
[01:01] <KimiNewt> anyway I saved beforehand so I'll try again
[01:01] <KimiNewt> that child was a mistake
[01:02] <Orbi> what the hells happening with that shower as well
[01:02] <Lelielle> cake was made with flour sugar eggs....and sterno
[01:02] <KimiNewt> also did this happen to you kab http://i42.tinypic.com/s5vbrr.jpg
[01:02] <Kabouter> As I said before, no
[01:02] <KimiNewt> oh sorry
[01:02] <DrForester> and the konami conference has begun...
[01:02] <KimiNewt> missed it
[01:02] * ZombieSupaStar has quit IRC (Quit: )
[01:02] <DrForester> with nothing
[01:02] <KimiNewt> it happened twice now
[01:02] <Kabouter> My sim did once get a bowl of cereal stuck on her hand though
[01:02] <Kabouter> Until I restarted the game
[01:02] <jake3hk> yhelo olivia munn legs
[01:02] <KimiNewt> that's nothing like a guitar stuck in the neck
[01:03] <Kabouter> Haha
[01:03] <KimiNewt> I loove the loading quips
[01:03] <Orbi> i am so getting the sims 3 now
[01:03] <Orbi> sounds awesome
[01:03] <KimiNewt> "Sequencing Llama Genome"
[01:03] <KimiNewt> "Unloading Loading Screens"
[01:03] * Kawasaki has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[01:04] <DrForester> QUEST 64!
[01:04] <DrForester> no doubt in Konami's plans
[01:04] <Eric> world of goo had loading like that
[01:04] <Orbi> all of the sims have had loading like that :P
[01:04] * EGM92 has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[01:04] <jake3hk> olivia gettin chunky
[01:04] * EGM92 has joined #GA
[01:04] <KimiNewt> really?
[01:04] <KimiNewt> I thought it was serious in the other ones
[01:04] <KimiNewt> and this is a parody of those
[01:05] <KimiNewt> I guess I never read the old ones too much?
[01:05] <EviLore> battlefield bad company 2 coming to pc, heh
[01:05] <Lelielle> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_No_Corrida  -geez sounds like a fun film....@_@
[01:05] <Orbi> me neither, it always loaded so fast
[01:05] <Orbi> i think some of them were jokes
[01:05] <KimiNewt> though I have to admit not THAT much changed
[01:05] <KimiNewt> and the buying options are soo limited, waiting for expansions
[01:06] <Orbi> meh
[01:07] <Orbi> i never played sims 2 so i might as well go for it
[01:08] <KimiNewt> oh shit
[01:08] <KimiNewt> I forgot I had school tomorrow
[01:09] <KimiNewt> and that I was supposed to do my biology work
[01:09] <KimiNewt> damn you EA
[01:09] <kassatsu> did konami start yet?
[01:09] * Kawasaki has joined #GA
[01:09] <jake3hk> they havin a presser?
[01:10] <Kabouter> I think by far the biggest change for The Sims 3 is that there is the option to have the rest of the game world change
[01:10] <KimiNewt> yeah but
[01:10] <Kabouter> In The Sims 2, other sims never aged, they never got married, they never had kids etc.
[01:10] <KimiNewt> I've been in relationship with some teen
[01:10] <KimiNewt> suddenly she goes young adult on my ass
[01:10] <Kabouter> Sucks to be you!
[01:11] <KimiNewt> What I never liked about the sims
[01:11] <Eric> dump her and get a new teen?
[01:11] <KimiNewt> is that you can basically press fast forward and it'll go on without you
[01:11] <KimiNewt> Probably better than if you had touched it
[01:12] <Eric> that's the lesson! playing god is hard!!
[01:12] <KimiNewt> also Kab, can the sims get fat?
[01:12] <Kabouter> Yes
[01:12] <Kabouter> Eat when their food bar ish igh
[01:12] <KimiNewt> I figured they can but it hadn't happened yet
[01:12] <duckroll> CASTEVANIA TIME
[01:12] <duckroll> EVERYONE
[01:12] <duckroll> GET HYPE
[01:12] <KimiNewt> oh
[01:12] <duckroll> PICK UP HYPE
[01:12] <duckroll> HYPE UP
[01:13] <KimiNewt> Also: Can you cheat on sims?
[01:13] <KimiNewt> and can you engage in homosexual relationships?
[01:13] <KimiNewt> since I saw you always have the "Romance" option or whatever
[01:13] <duckroll> Room is at capacity now. A lot of people turned away. Hope we get underway soon.
[01:13] <Kabouter> Yes and yes
[01:13] <duckroll> LOL
[01:13] <KimiNewt> That would be pretty bold
[01:13] <Kabouter> There is also gay marriage
[01:13] <KimiNewt> Cool
[01:13] <KimiNewt> Can you adopt a baby
[01:13] <KimiNewt> Bold of EA, very nice
[01:15] <KimiNewt> In the same vain: can you accidentally get a baby during woohoo or not get a baby when "trying for a baby"
[01:15] <TEEEPO> hmm
[01:15] <Kabouter> You can adopt a baby yes
[01:15] <Kabouter> I don't know about the WooHoo thing
[01:15] <TEEEPO> some of the gameplay footage of mag
[01:15] <TEEEPO> looks a hell of a lot better then what was shown at the press confrence
[01:15] <Eric> does the baby turn gay when raided by gays?
[01:15] <Eric> lol raided
[01:15] <Eric> raised
[01:16] <Kabouter> It's all player choice
[01:16] <Kabouter> I dunno about the AI
[01:16] <TEEEPO> what game
[01:16] <Eric> so gay is a choice then!
[01:16] <Kabouter> But if you are playing a char, they are never inherently any sexuality
[01:16] <Lelielle> lol
[01:16] <EviLore> god of war 3 doesn't have screen tearing!?!  blasphemy!
[01:17] <KimiNewt> so the pets expansion

[01:58] <DrForester> E3 was great this year.  Solid conferences from the big 3, and the epic faulure of failures from Ubisoft that will go down in history
[01:58] <Eric> http://www.gametrailers.com/video/gc-2008-lords-of/38751 lords of shadow trailer from last year
[01:58] <Eric> when no one cared about it cause it didn't have castlevania in the title
[01:59] <ghst> e3 was an imagination graveyard, i gave a shit about 3 games, all of which were iterations.
[01:59] <DrForester> wait so it's entirely possible the castlevnia name was just slappe don it at the last minute to generate hype..?
[01:59] <Eric> not possible

[02:02] <kassatsu> Over at the Atlus E3 booth you may spot an interesting title being displayed - Trine, and on an Xbox 360.

[02:02] <kassatsu> do xbots care about this game now?
[02:02] <DrForester> Only real strong points of ubisoft conference were splinter cell, red steel 2 and the Rabbids Animal Abuse demo

[03:00] <Tiduz\`> jaw meet floor.
[03:00] * GaimeGuy has joined #GA
[03:00] <KimiNewt> that's against his whole agenda I suppose
[03:00] <KimiNewt> I don't see how people expect a non-peaceful situation to last somehow 
[03:00] <EGM92> like the shit in the trailer???
[03:01] <KimiNewt> like my dad for example
[03:01] <Tiduz\`> it looked GREAT
[03:01] <Tiduz\`> better than 1
[03:01] <KimiNewt> says peace is impossible
[03:01] <Tiduz\`> and it was multi
[03:01] <EGM92> Does everything blow up?
[03:01] <mrsolo> kminewt: which is? what one israel death to arabs?
[03:01] <Tiduz\`> Havent played much, didnt see much blow up
[03:01] <Tiduz\`> but the graphics are insane
[03:01] <EGM92> how did you get into the beta??
[03:01] <KimiNewt> Preetty much when it comes down to it mrsolo
[03:01] <Tiduz\`> Infamous preorder
[03:01] <KimiNewt> I don't get that shit
[03:01] <KimiNewt> what the fuck do they want if not peace
[03:02] <mrsolo> forever war
[03:02] <KimiNewt> they can't kick them off the land
[03:02] * PopOnArrival has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[03:02] <EGM92> has there been a lot of PSN titles announced at E3?
[03:02] <KimiNewt> it's retarded
[03:02] <KimiNewt> I don't care nor have time for this shit
[03:03] <KimiNewt> this whole nation is based on shit in the first place
[03:03] <Tiduz\`> EGM92 not really
[03:03] <Tiduz\`> But...
[03:03] <Tiduz\`> FAT PRINCESS PSP :o
[03:03] <jett\awesomecharted> castlevania looks pretty good
[03:03] <KimiNewt> andb because people can't say "Alright, the foundations are shit but we're all here now and we better make the fucking best out of it"
[03:03] * PopOnArrival has joined #GA
[03:03] <mrsolo> another castlevania?....zzzzz
[03:03] <Somnia> ugh my head is hurting so fucking bad
[03:03] <Somnia> day 4 of no soda
[03:03] <KimiNewt> anyway mrsolo
[03:03] <Tiduz\`> jett\awesomecharted: i only saw him kneeling and cracking his whip
[03:03] <Tiduz\`> wheres the gameplay
[03:03] <Tiduz\`> ''Gene Doctors Milk Mice; Yield Human Breast Milk Protein''
[03:03] <Tiduz\`> lolwat
[03:04] <mrsolo> kiminewt: i dunno.. i think if israsel keep doing this way
[03:04] <mrsolo> iran will send out nukes first
[03:04] <KimiNewt> Gah
[03:04] <KimiNewt> Just don't send them my way
[03:04] <KimiNewt> It could be good
[03:04] <Somnia> so I stopped listening to ListenUP's show last night because of garnett...giantbomb was so much better
[03:04] <KimiNewt> if Iran bombs the shit out of this place
[03:04] <KimiNewt> Everyone will step in and fuck up Iran as well
[03:04] <KimiNewt> the whole middle east is fucked
[03:04] <mrsolo> iranians aren't even arabs
[03:04] <Lelielle> mice and us are similiar enough to do stuff like that 
[03:05] <KimiNewt> so maybe they'll shut up for 50 years
[03:05] <Lelielle> theyre persian
[03:05] <Tiduz\`> EGM92
[03:05] <Tiduz\`> did you finish infamous ?
[03:05] <Tiduz\`> or anyone here?
[03:05] <KimiNewt> same thing for most people
[03:05] <osaka> what were the capcom mystery games?
[03:05] <Lelielle> persians have a pretty neat history
[03:05] <Tiduz\`> Resident evil PSP
[03:05] <Tiduz\`> lulz
[03:05] <KimiNewt> People here, and I assume on the other side, are so tied to nationalism and religion
[03:05] <KimiNewt> it pisses me off sometimes
[03:05] <Tiduz\`> and tatsunoko
[03:06] <TEEEPO> yeh yeh we do
[03:06] <mrsolo> they aren't the same! duh.. narrow minded people living in your hood eh kimi?
[03:06] <Lelielle> those aerious wedge issues that keep people from seeing jow alike they are
[03:06] <Lelielle> how
[03:06] <KimiNewt> Yes, I truly hope it isn't the same everywhere
[03:06] <Tiduz\`> EGM92: DavidEllisGot a ton of extra beta codes for Uncharted 2. Expect details on tonight's Listen Up.
[03:06] <KimiNewt> I've only been with these people
[03:07] <KimiNewt> I expect the intelligensia has more left-wing opinions but are also the type of people not to get involved
[03:07] <Somnia> oh fuck crazy Cane dude from Red Steel 2 Ubi showing it on g4
[03:07] <KimiNewt> and I don't care that I'm implying that dumb people are right winged
[03:07] <jett\awesomecharted> U2 DESPERATELY needs a "ring" sound when you kill someone, like Killzone 2
[03:07] <jett\awesomecharted> I have no idea when I've killed people in this beta
[03:07] <Tiduz\`> Monkey island is coming up at Gamepsot e3 feed
[03:07] <Somnia> ya or maybe a better visualizer so you know
[03:07] <TEEEPO> people need
[03:07] <Somnia> otherwise <3 <3 Uncharted 2
[03:07] <mrsolo> kimi: right wing people are pretty much same everywhere..just different issue
[03:07] <TEEEPO> to know how to play ctf
[03:07] <jett\awesomecharted> that too
[03:07] <Lelielle> any classic lucasarts remakes are ok by me
[03:08] <Tiduz\`> Im probably gonna get stoned for this
[03:08] <Somnia> people need to learn how to throw the fucking treasure
[03:08] <Somnia> its stupid
[03:08] <KimiNewt> If they'd all just sit down and like..
[03:08] <KimiNewt> write a spreadsheet
[03:08] <Tiduz\`> but am i the only one who liked the grenade explosions from one better?
[03:08] <jett\awesomecharted> how DO you throw shit?
[03:08] <ghst> monkey island isnt just a remake though
[03:08] <Tiduz\`> The smoke from that looked awesome
[03:08] <Somnia> L2
[03:08] <KimiNewt> a cost/benefit sheet of what they're doing
[03:08] <jett\awesomecharted> i picked up a canister, but I had no idea how to throw it
[03:08] <Lelielle> conservatism is based a lot of keeping information away from people 
[03:08] <KimiNewt> maybe they'll realise they're dumbasses
[03:08] <Somnia> just like a gernade jett
[03:08] <Tiduz\`> Tales of monkey island after that ghst
[03:08] <Somnia> hold L2
[03:08] <jett\awesomecharted> all right
[03:08] <jett\awesomecharted> tiduz: it's a beta
[03:08] <Tiduz\`> no i mean from SP too
[03:08] <Tiduz\`> the explosion itself
[03:08] <TEEEPO> l2
[03:08] <ghst> yeah, that's what i meant. that's what i'm looking forward to anyway.
[03:08] <TEEEPO> same as the grenade

[03:15] <Lelielle> wow, its so pretty
[03:15] <Somnia> dunno
[03:15] <Somnia> but it looks awesome as hell
[03:15] <jett\awesomecharted> i don't think ayami is working on this game
[03:15] <Lelielle> like the backgrounds in DMC4 but nicer
[03:15] <jett\awesomecharted> or yamane
[03:15] <Lelielle> huh, looks like her designs
[03:15] <jett\awesomecharted> they don't look like women, so no
[03:16] <jett\awesomecharted> yamane definitely didn't compose the music in the trailer though
[03:16] <Lelielle> the lady who did the narration for GoW is awesome too
[03:16] <Tiduz\`> holyshittits
[03:17] <Tiduz\`> buying castlevania

[03:18] <DrForester> Jason Issacs:  Need a generican evil british guy voice?  I"M YOUR MAN!
[03:18] <EviLore> interesting trailer
[03:18] <EviLore> looks sorta like god of war
[03:18] <Lelielle> yeah, but better
[03:18] <jake3hk> ^
[03:19] <TEEEPO> eh
[03:19] <jett\awesomecharted> better? not really
[03:19] <jett\awesomecharted> it's a god of war clone
[03:19] <jett\awesomecharted> guy even has the same movements as kratos
[03:19] <Lelielle> but its castlevania
[03:19] <jett\awesomecharted> it's kinda ridiculous
[03:19] <Lelielle> GoW had some cheese factor
[03:20] <jett\awesomecharted> the cheese in gow is awesome
[03:20] <Lelielle> i don't like cheese in dark games like that
[03:20] <jett\awesomecharted> SotN has the best cheese though
[03:20] <jett\awesomecharted> gow isn't that dark
[03:20] <Lelielle> castlevania just has bad VA usually
[03:20] <Acosta> gow is quite festive actually
[03:20] * PopOnArrival has joined #GA
[03:20] <GaimeGuy> Nikniknik
[03:21] <TEEEPO> gow is fucking awesome
[03:21] <Lelielle> he might have left for da ferry home
[03:21] <GaimeGuy> lel, your brother better be playing PW
[03:21] <TEEEPO> castlevania hasn't been since sotn
[03:21] <EviLore> sotn, never matched
[03:21] <BJ-Unit> Dawn of Sorrow was fun
[03:21] <Lelielle> Gow is cool yes, but I like the creatures and stuff in Castlevania, and I'm a huge greek/roman myth fan
[03:21] <Acosta> I really enjoy the portable castlevania
[03:21] <Bob_Coffee> i liked Ooe as much as sotn.
[03:22] <DrForester> They just taked the CV name onto a game no one was hyped ofr, wasn't lord of chadows shown last year?  no CV int he title?
[03:22] <Acosta> actually finishing potait and is really fun
[03:22] <Bob_Coffee> dawn was nice, for julius mode, which was better than the main game. por had cool music, but kinda sucked.
[03:22] <TEEEPO> just a trailer
[03:22] <jake3hk> yhelo munn
[03:22] <BJ-Unit> :) mantis asking me if I liked Castlevania
[03:22] <Bob_Coffee> i should give portrait another run one of these days
[03:22] <Lelielle> WHAT IS A MAN!?
[03:22] <Lelielle> lol
[03:23] <EGM92> So is Dracula in this?
[03:23] <jake3hk> draculas castle at the beginning of it
[03:23] <Bob_Coffee> isnt he always? with exception of aos and dos.
[03:23] <EGM92> then no he isn't bob, you fucking retard.
[03:24] <jett\awesomecharted> isn't the main character in those Alucard?
[03:24] <jett\awesomecharted> er
[03:24] <jett\awesomecharted> DRACULA
[03:24] <Lelielle> lol
[03:24] <Bob_Coffee> yea, kinda.
[03:25] <jett\awesomecharted> this game is thankfully forgetting all about the IGAverse
[03:26] <Acosta> portrait is fun, but quite easy
[03:26] <Acosta> they are totally overpowered

[03:41] <jett\awesomecharted> what is it with these fucking ninthings defending iga's castlevania
[03:42] <jett\awesomecharted> i wish i could ban them all

[04:21] <EGM92> Moses explaining to the jews about the burning bush was pretty funny
[04:21] <Lelielle> theres a vid with sarah silverman talking about "oh man, he's too edgy even for me"
[04:21] <BJ-Unit> Oh wow, I didn't know the Braves got Nate McLouth

[04:21] <Shuri> The studio is keeping mum on the new take, simply calling a "contemporized adaptation." 
[04:21] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> now they're remaking 90's movies
[04:22] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> awesome
[04:22] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> total recall is so bad ass
[04:22] <BJ-Unit> No wonder Schafer got sent down

[04:22] <Lelielle> http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=54277991  -lol

[04:23] <Shuri> now its all cgi, no nudity and shaky cams
[04:23] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> no one getting impaled
[04:23] <Shuri> and it LOOKS SHITTIER
[04:23] <Unison> yeah shuri
[04:23] <Unison> no famous actresses do nudity now
[04:23] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> no arnie using a body as a human shield
[04:23] <Shuri> and it SOMEHOW ends up costing 10x the budget of the original
[04:23] <Unison> in the 80s they ALL did
[04:23] <Shuri> arnie didnt use any body
[04:23] <Shuri> he used the body of a RANDOM DUDE 
[04:23] <Maxrpg> unison: in the 80s they were nobodies
[04:23] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> lol
[04:23] <Unison> anyone showed their tits in the 80s
[04:23] <Unison> no max
[04:23] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> well he wasn't random
[04:23] <Unison> in mainstream movies
[04:23] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> he happened to be standing in front of him and got shot the fuck up
[04:23] <Unison> big actresses would show their tits all the time
[04:23] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> and arnie's like
[04:23] <Shuri> i think he was just the guy behind him on the levator
[04:23] <Unison> now it is a big fucking occasion
[04:23] * Firestorm has joined #GA
[04:23] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> "Well shit, no use letting this body go to waste!"
[04:24] <Maxrpg> unison; times change
[04:24] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> lol
[04:24] <Unison> for the worse!

[04:24] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> see nudity I don't care about
[04:24] <Shuri> yeah
[04:24] <Maxrpg> nudity is liek w/e
[04:24] <Lelielle> well the US has become more puritan but progressive at the same time, weird
[04:24] <Unison> i dont need to see that
[04:24] <Shuri> but more like the violence, the vibe
[04:24] <Unison> but i want to
[04:24] <Unison> hahaha
[04:24] <Unison> yeah shuri
[04:24] <Unison> i agree
[04:24] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> but proper action, decent violence, it's gone downhill
[04:24] <Maxrpg> the vibe.. shuri wants to get off when he goes into the theater
[04:24] <Unison> it is just prudish now
[04:24] <Maxrpg> grindhouse?
[04:24] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> too much cg bullshit
[04:24] <Shuri> Taken brought me back to early '90 flicks
[04:24] <Shuri> like The Last Boyscott
[04:24] <Maxrpg> taken was awesome
[04:24] <Shuri> non stop action, men being men
[04:24] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> where's the stunt work, the minature se pieces
[04:24] <Lelielle> with tabloids I wouldn't want to do nudity as an actress
[04:24] <Maxrpg> just beat the fuck out of people
[04:25] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> yep
[04:25] <Maxrpg> shinobi: costlier now? lol
[04:25] <Shuri> its all cgi for explosions, and even blood
[04:25] <Unison> i am not ashamed of my body
[04:25] <Unison> fuck it
[04:25] <Unison> if i had a personal trainer
[04:25] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> haha
[04:25] <Shuri> whats weird is how movies nowadays feels super fast
[04:25] <Shuri> they are always rushing 
[04:25] <Unison> i'd be naked in all movies!
[04:25] <Shuri> from a scene to the other
[04:25] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> then you wouldn' thave anyone watch your movies
[04:25] <Maxrpg> cgi on the cheap
[04:25] <Unison> haha shin
[04:25] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> there's miri egm
[04:25] <Shuri> so all the big action flicks feel super short and empty
[04:25] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> goddamnit
[04:25] <Maxrpg> shuri: case in point star trek
[04:25] <Lelielle> i'm all for non sexual nudity, people have no idea what naked people look like these days...cept for themselves
[04:25] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> it's like 3 seconds and she's gone

[04:26] <Unison> it's no big deal
[04:26] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> what's hilarious unison

[04:26] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> OMG I CAN SEE HIS BLUE DICK OMG SO DISTRACTING
[04:26] <Unison> cg-dick
[04:26] <Shuri> its like that  for all movies now
[04:26] <Lelielle> win puritan thinking all nuditt is sexual, which is kinda a big barrier
[04:26] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> I'm like...really?
[04:26] <Maxrpg> shinobi: if its a guy people will make noise
[04:26] <Shuri> but i cant stand random shit being cgi
[04:26] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> are you that fucking immature?
[04:26] <Shuri> i miss real explosions
[04:26] <Maxrpg> male nudity = bad female nudity = good / double standard HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[04:26] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> I guess
[04:27] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> but I mean
[04:27] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> I'm not big on male nudity
[04:27] <Lelielle>  i am
[04:27] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> but in watchmen it isn't really noticable

[04:27] <Unison> i dont even care about female nudity in movies 
[04:27] <Unison> honestly
[04:27] <Maxrpg> shinobi: i would be pissed if the guy is supposed to be nude in the movie and they took it away because people bitched
[04:27] <Unison> whatever

[04:27] <Unison> on principle
[04:27] <Lelielle> i saw Viggo's weiner
[04:27] * Wes_ has quit IRC (Quit: Wow! What a great client! Bersirc 2.2 [ http://www.bersirc.org/ - Open Source IRC ])

[04:28] <Maxrpg> get your ass to mars
[04:28] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> that's my favourite scene
[04:28] <Lelielle> discussion is too much work i guess, "i have to explain stuff to my kid nau!!???"
[04:28] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> motherfuck just shoots the shit out of the rats
[04:28] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> GET YOUR ASS TO MARS *repeat*
[04:28] <Maxrpg> heh
[04:28] * Somnia has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[04:28] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> rat guts rolling down the screen
[04:29] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> just priceless
[04:29] <Lelielle> my dad was pretty good as not censoring my viewing and explaining things
[04:29] <Maxrpg> also the scene from t2 when he tries to smile and then frowns, meme ahoy
[04:29] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> haha
[04:29] <Lelielle> i mean within reason
[04:29] <Maxrpg> i love that meme
[04:29] <Maxrpg> its priceless, like t2
[04:29] <Lelielle> but I saw films like the wild bunch fairly early on
[04:29] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> robocop had some priceless scenes
[04:29] <DrForester> The PG calssic "Airplane" had nudity
[04:29] <Maxrpg> oh btw if you have punch out FUCK great tiger
[04:29] <DrForester> how it got a PG... no one knows...
[04:29] <Maxrpg> shinobi: bitches, leave
[04:29] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> yeah forester
[04:29] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> lol
[04:30] <Maxrpg> movies back then were slack, most people knew not to take kids to them
[04:30] <Shuri> starship trooper was the last '80 style movie
[04:30] <Maxrpg> nowadays kids have infected everything
[04:30] <Unison> yeah shuri
[04:30] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> raiders of the lost ark would probably be rated pg13 now
[04:30] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> same with jaws
[04:30] <Unison> ST had no shape
[04:30] <Maxrpg> tv, movies, video games
[04:30] <Unison> *shame
[04:30] <Unison> haha
[04:30] <DrForester> Shinobi, for the purposes of not getting mya ss banned... i made sure to cut off my ubisoft gif right before the boobs...
[04:30] <DrForester> http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v247/DrForester/UbisoftShirley.gif
[04:30] <Shuri> toys!
[04:30] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> hell I'm surprised jaws wasn't rated R
[04:30] <Shuri> ultra violence!
[04:30] <DrForester> On the other hand, had I left them in I might be a GAF hero...
[04:30] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> lol
[04:31] <Maxrpg> unison: everything is dumbed down for the pursuit of the dollar, the more people you can get to see your movie/watch your tv/buy your game the better
[04:31] <Maxrpg> after all there are more kids in the world than adults
[04:31] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> airplane = greatest comedy/slapstick movie EVER
[04:31] <Lelielle> more violence less realistic sex
[04:31] <Maxrpg> have you ever seen a grown man naked
[04:31] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> see that's why T3 haters can kiss my ass
[04:31] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> at least T3 was rated R
[04:31] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> no bullshit compromising
[04:31] <DrForester> I love my airplan eubisoft .gif...
[04:31] <jake3hk> for no reason
[04:31] <DrForester> because i got to use airplane
[04:31] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> haha yeah
[04:31] <BJ-Unit> Still waiting for the Nats game to start, yawn. They probably won't make a decision for another 30 minutes. Gotta be fun getting to a game and waiting for 3 hours for it to possibly start
[04:31] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> T3 really wasn't even a hard R
[04:32] <Lelielle> I liked Top secret ok
[04:32] <jake3hk> it could be rated pg13
[04:32] <jake3hk> er
[04:32] <jake3hk> pg
[04:32] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> it's like a semi soft pg13 really
[04:32] <jett\awesomecharted> i have no idea why T3 is R
[04:32] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> there's like one scene that's over the top
[04:32] <jett\awesomecharted> seriously
[04:32] <DrForester> T2 wasn't even a hard R.   T2 was rated R jsut becasue fo the rip off hand scene
[04:32] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> where she puts her arm through that cop
[04:32] <jett\awesomecharted> is there ven swearing in the movie? blood? i don't remember
[04:32] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> yeah
[04:32] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> there's some swearing
[04:32] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> couple f bombs, but that's it
[04:32] <DrForester> you can get by with swearing in PG films
[04:33] <jake3hk> t3 fails for being rated r and not having the terminator chick naked for half the movie
[04:33] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> with the s word you can
[04:33] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> it's a bit harder with the f bomb
[04:33] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> haha
[04:33] <Maxrpg> pg or pg13 can have one fuck right?
[04:33] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> yeah
[04:33] <BJ-Unit> and boobies! Weekend at Bernies 2 PG boobies from like 30 feet away
[04:33] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> trivia (everyone should know this)
[04:33] <DrForester> BJ airplane had boobies from abotu 2ft away and got a PG
[04:33] <Lelielle> well the MPAA is pretty dumbass   violence=ok  women getting herself off=nc-17  (and there is no nudity)
[04:33] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> name the movie that ushered in the pg13 rating
[04:33] <DrForester> Shinobi, Jurassic Park?
[04:33] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> nope
[04:34] <Maxrpg> what was the rating for jerry maquire
[04:34] <Maxrpg> maguire
[04:34] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> 10 years before
[04:34] <darkh23> temple of doom
[04:34] <BJ-Unit> I'ma have to look up when they even implemented PG-13
[04:34] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> it was a speilberg flick though
[04:34] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> *ding ding*
[04:34] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> temple it was
[04:34] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> which makes sense
[04:34] <Lelielle> this film has not yet been rated sums up all the idiocy 
[04:34] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> what with kids getting their asses whipped
[04:34] <Shuri> dude
[04:34] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> and the most bad ass human sacrifice scene of all time
[04:34] <Shuri> temple of doom is my favorite indiana jones flick
[04:34] <jake3hk> tru
[04:35] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> raiders > all for me
[04:35] <Shuri> it's so epic
[04:35] <Lelielle> yeah
[04:35] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> in fact raiders is just about my favourite movie ever
[04:35] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> along with jaws
[04:35] <Shuri> if i rate the trilogy.. 
[04:35] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> but I love temple as well
[04:35] <jett\awesomecharted> LOL at the airplane! gif
[04:35] <Maxrpg> what was narnia's rating
[04:35] <Shuri> i'd say 1) temple 2) last crusade 3) raiders
[04:35] <Maxrpg> the firstone
[04:35] <happy_phantom> :3 "I'm curious why you even own a ps3, you've said yourself you're not interested in shooters, so what exactly do you play?"
[04:35] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> damn
[04:35] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> raiders third?
[04:35] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> cold as haagen dasz
[04:35] <Shuri> well
[04:35] <jett\awesomecharted> shinobi: i dunno, Apocalpyto's sacrifice scene is up there
[04:36] <Shuri> i would put it equal to last crusade
[04:36] <Shuri> theres nothing wrong with it
[04:36] <Shuri> its just that LC felt more epic i guess
[04:36] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> dude, he pulled his still beating heart out of his chest!
[04:36] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> and he was still alive!
[04:36] <darkh23> I loved last crusade despite all the haters
[04:36] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> then watched it burn the fuck up as he got lowered into the lava!!!
[04:36] <DrForester> wait...
[04:36] <Shuri> that's the power of the sankara rocks!
[04:36] <DrForester> Last crusade had haters?
[04:36] <Maxrpg> narnia was rated pg
[04:36] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> last crusade is fine
[04:36] <darkh23> tons of last crusade haters
[04:36] <jett\awesomecharted> shinobi: lulz they do the same in apocalypto, except afterwards they show him the heart, cut off his head, and we have a first person view of his head rolling dowm some stairs
[04:36] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> it just feels like a sanitized raiders
[04:36] <Bob_CoffeeAway> kali maaa kali maaa shokdiday!
[04:36] <DrForester> WTF hates Last Crusade?
[04:36] <jake3hk> lol
[04:36] <Maxrpg> the sacrificial scene where they killed the lion
[04:36] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> LOL jett
[04:36] <Maxrpg> that was some crazy shit
[04:37] <Shuri> it must be some internet thing
[04:37] <jake3hk> every scene in temple owns
[04:37] <Shuri> kinda like how the internet hates Godfather 3
[04:37] <jake3hk> the lao che plane
[04:37] <Shuri> but i cant really see anything all that wrong with it
[04:37] <Maxrpg> KALI MAAAAAA
[04:37] <Maxrpg> KALI MAAAAA
[04:37] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> take everything away from last crusade and it still rules simply because of connery
[04:37] <jake3hk> the sky dive, the sacrifice the bridge
[04:37] <Maxrpg> connery hell yeah
[04:37] <jett\awesomecharted> yeah connery is too good
[04:37] <jake3hk> NICE TRY LAO CHE
[04:37] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> *Slap* "That's for blasphemy."
[04:38] <Shuri> i remember being shocked as a kid when indy's friend got killed

[00:00] <ghst> cook the shit that is in your freezer
[00:00] <ghst> then you can fill it again
[00:00] <Sea_Manky> I do
[00:00] <KimiNewt> manky
[00:00] <Sea_Manky> But I'd like to have more variety
[00:00] <KimiNewt> what do you cook if you're too tired/hungry to cook
[00:01] <KimiNewt> you know what I mean
[00:01] <ghst> do you only leave your house  once a month or something?
[00:01] <Sea_Manky> ... I cook the stuff I've frozen
[00:01] <Sea_Manky> that's the point
[00:01] <KimiNewt> well alright
[00:01] <KimiNewt> what if you have no stuff froze
[00:01] <Sea_Manky> ghst: Sure.  I don't eat out though.
[00:01] <Sea_Manky> Kimi: Impossible.
[00:01] <KimiNewt> a tragic oversight has caused to to remain without leftovers
[00:01] <Sea_Manky> Oversight?
[00:02] <KimiNewt> yes
[00:02] <KimiNewt> you did not expect so many people to show up! ate up all your food!
[00:02] <KimiNewt> there was an eruption and you forgot to lava-secure your freezer
[00:02] <Sea_Manky> Dude, I currently have to _plan_ my large batches of cooking because I don't have enough room to store everything I'd like to have available constantly.
[00:02] <mintywk> tiduz: ohh.a rather plain looking game runs relatively well on a super powerful pc!! let's celebrate!!
[00:03] <KimiNewt> so you would say it is absolutly impossible for you to be without food
[00:03] <KimiNewt> Intersting
[00:04] <Sea_Manky> Currently in my freezer: about sixty fried chicken wings, several large servings of beef with barley soup, probably 50 or so potstickers, about six pounds of french fries, a couple big servings of baked pasta, several pounds of ground beef, a couple pounds of eye of round which I will be doubling this very night, and several bowls of cream of broccoli soup
[00:04] <Sea_Manky> oh, and a big container of homemade ice cream
[00:04] <Sea_Manky> And there's more stuff I _want_ to make so it'll be available.
[00:05] <ghst> what the hell
[00:05] <Sea_Manky> Oh, and I forgot the ten pounds of chicken breast
[00:05] <Sea_Manky> Shit, let me go look and see if I've forgotten anything
[00:05] <ghst> are you some kind of cave giant?
[00:06] <Sea_Manky> Okay, that seems to be it, aside from the one last container of roma tomato sauce
[00:06] <Sea_Manky> so that's ANOTHER batch of shit I need to make
[00:06] <KimiNewt> this sounds like an oversight to me
[00:07] <Sea_Manky> It won't be once I have my new freezer!
[00:07] <Sea_Manky> Coz right now, I simply don't have room to make more sauce, or a batch of cream of chicken like I'd like to, or pierogies, or lasagna
[00:07] * milh31 has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[00:07] <Sea_Manky> A second flavor of ice cream would be dandy too
[00:08] <Sea_Manky> man, this is gonna rock. :D
[00:08] <KimiNewt> do you ever make non-meat lasagna, does it taste like shit
[00:08] <KimiNewt> vegetarian I suppose
[00:08] <Sea_Manky> no, I don't
[00:08] <Sea_Manky> But there's nothing wrong with meatless pasta
[00:08] <KimiNewt> I dunno
[00:08] <KimiNewt> It feels.. missing to me.. incomplete
[00:08] <Sea_Manky> well, I prefer it with meat too, but I don't mind a plain cheese lasagna
[00:09] <mintywk> cream of broccoli soup
[00:09] <mintywk> ;x
[00:09] <Sea_Manky> I can also go back to making homemade mashed potatoes again! :D
[00:09] <Sea_Manky> minty: That's my wife's. :P
[00:11] <Sea_Manky> hmmm
[00:11] <Sea_Manky> I wonder if I can mass cook and freeze chicken fried steaks for easy reheating. :d
[00:11] <Sea_Manky> but nah, I wouldn't be able to do the gravy right
[00:11] <Sea_Manky> gotta do it right when you make the steaks
[00:12] <Sea_Manky> now, let's take a peek at this eye of round cut, see if I want to make a roast tonight
[00:14] <Tiduz> Sims 3 sells 1.4 million in its first week

[00:28] <KimiNewt> what kinda phrase is that
[00:28] <bjork-wtf> it means you stay home alone a lot or something
[00:28] <Lelielle> kid that both parents are gone when they get home from school
[00:30] * stump has joined #GA
[00:33] <KimiNewt> yeah I got that but it's odd that there's an odd phrase like that for that
[00:33] <Sea_Manky> Chubby Checker needs to be sued for misleading marketing.
[00:33] <KimiNewt> are parents supposed to be at home at all times
[00:33] * mintywk has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.6/2009011913])
[00:33] <KimiNewt> oh yeah
[00:33] <Lelielle> well traditionally they were
[00:33] <KimiNewt> I remember this one time I was watching Dead Like Me
[00:33] <Lelielle> mom at least
[00:33] <Lelielle> nuclear fmaily model
[00:33] <KimiNewt> and there was an episode where a babysitter for a 9 year old I think ditched
[00:34] <KimiNewt> and the kid was left alone and when cops came for some reason they later questioned the mother for negligence
[00:34] <Sea_Manky> having a parent available 24/7 is better for kids
[00:34] <KimiNewt> can that kinda shit actually happen in the states?
[00:34] <Lelielle> yeah
[00:34] <KimiNewt> or was it bullshit
[00:34] <KimiNewt> My parents were home for me until I got to school
[00:34] <Lelielle> cost of living usually doesn't allow a stay at home nowadays
[00:34] <Sea_Manky> yeah, which is part of the problem
[00:34] <KimiNewt> Yeah it seems bizzare for a parent to be home at 3pm or soemthing
[00:35] <KimiNewt> my parents would come back at like 8pmish
[00:35] <KimiNewt> Never bothered us though
[00:35] <Lelielle> i had other adults in the neighborhood that looked after us when parents were working
[00:36] <BJ43> If my parents had done that to me we'd be on a first name basis
[00:36] <KimiNewt> but where you're nine or something
[00:36] <KimiNewt> you can take care of yourself for a few hours obviously, are there laws agaisnt this
[00:36] <bjork-wtf> I stayed home alone a lot
[00:36] <Lelielle> i was left to my own devices a lot
[00:36] <bjork-wtf> it was cool
[00:36] <bjork-wtf> see
[00:36] <Lelielle> didn't get into much trouble
[00:36] <bjork-wtf> if you wanna be one of the cool kids, you had to be neglected as a youth
[00:36] * bjork-wtf highfive nyanko
[00:37] <KimiNewt> my mom always left me lunch in the fridge
[00:37] <KimiNewt> what else do I need
[00:37] <KimiNewt> I wasn't gonna jump off the roof
[00:38] <KimiNewt> wont it cause issues if a kid is with his parent almost all the time
[00:39] <Sea_Manky> yes, I'm totally sure everyone had issues before double income parents were invented.  ROLL FUCKING EYES

[00:39] <Lelielle> ah they finished
[00:39] <KimiNewt> these days it would seem overly spoiled
[00:40] <Sea_Manky> And that's the problem.  We consider a basic part of human development and growth a luxury.
[00:40] <Sea_Manky> Meanwhile, how big has the whole medicate yourself culture gotten?
[00:41] <Sea_Manky> our priorities are fucked up.

[00:44] <KimiNewt> so we better find ways to make the best of what we have now?
[00:44] <Sea_Manky> shut up kid.
[00:44] <KimiNewt> Beh

[00:57] <Wes> But The Fear and Not Fair are pretty good
[00:57] <KimiNewt> I can't even explain why it's funny
[00:58] <KimiNewt> Is it because it's oddly vulgar? is it because of the "very much"? is it because she's complaining about a 4channer or something?

[00:59] <KimiNewt> I might not like it as much as their old ones, it's very different. I haven't decided yet
[00:59] <KimiNewt> Djya not like em?
[01:00] <Wes> I haven't heard them in mainstream music for ages
[01:00] <Wes> like a decade? not sure

[01:01] <Gattsu25> I'm off to go see my brother who's in Philly atm
[01:01] <Wes> baggy trousers that was it
[01:01] <KimiNewt> the school song
[01:01] <KimiNewt> pulling hair and eating dirt
[01:01] <Gattsu25> he's going to have surgery tomorrow to remove the cancer in his colon
[01:01] <Wes> used to be played all the time at my school discos back in the day
[01:01] <Wes> that and Cooton Eye Joe
[01:01] <Wes> Botton*
[01:01] <Wes> Cotton****
[01:02] <KimiNewt> they had an album in 99'
[01:02] <KimiNewt> I don't think I've listened to all of their songs actually, and they've also a few ones that I dislike
[01:02] <KimiNewt> it reached fifth on the uk charts apparently? the new album that is
[01:03] <stump> some guy 2 miles from me landed 112 planes in flight control :(
[01:03] <Wes> Well it completely passed me by but I haven't listened to the radio much lately.

[01:03] <KimiNewt> Had a story or at least a theme
[01:04] <KimiNewt> These ones, some of them completely don't and some are hard to stitch up a theme
[01:04] <KimiNewt> and most of the songs aren't as cheerful

[01:05] <Kab_Laptop> Last month the best selling PC game in the US was The Sims 2 Double Deluxe
[01:05] <EviLore> it prints money
[01:05] <Kab_Laptop> Seriously
[01:06] <Kab_Laptop> WoW and The Sims ALWAYS dominate that chart
[01:06] <KimiNewt> It's probably shit easy to churn out those "Stuff Packs" too
[01:06] <Wes> Never really had an interested in Madness to be honest. They seemed a bit too wacky for my liking.
[01:06] <Kab_Laptop> It's like no other PC game has legs
[01:06] <KimiNewt> Wacky's good
[01:06] <stump> Futurama renewed.
[01:06] <Kab_Laptop> Madness? The band Madness?
[01:06] <KimiNewt> yeah
[01:06] <Kab_Laptop> I.e. creators of the worst music to ever curse this world?
[01:06] <KimiNewt> but they're all old now, you know
[01:06] <KimiNewt> What
[01:06] <Kab_Laptop> I HATE Madness
[01:06] <Kab_Laptop> I hate it with a passion
[01:06] <KimiNewt> well, that's just, like, your opinion man
[01:06] <Sea_Manky> stump: OH REALLY IN ALL CAPS
[01:07] <KimiNewt> I love it
[01:07] <Kab_Laptop> I'd rather listen to Vengaboys all day than to one Madness song
[01:07] <KimiNewt> I don't even know who those are
[01:07] <Sea_Manky> stump: link already! >:|
[01:07] <Kab_Laptop> Seriously?
[01:07] <KimiNewt> No, I was lying
[01:08] <KimiNewt> yes I have no idea who those are

[01:08] <KimiNewt> how am I to know of a dutch eurodance band
[01:08] <Sea_Manky> how did comedy central get it?!?
[01:08] <stump> KimiNewt: the venga bus is coming! everybody's coming! new york to san francisco! something something something!
[01:08] <Kab_Laptop> Also, the 'seriously?' was a statement :P
[01:08] <KimiNewt> okay I know that song
[01:09] <stump> KimiNewt: i guess they were popular before you were born
[01:09] <KimiNewt> it was a joke
[01:09] <Kab_Laptop> There's a mountain of crap in the related items 
[01:09] <KimiNewt> I know of the song I wasn't familiar with the band's name
[01:09] <KimiNewt> no thanks
[01:09] <Kab_Laptop> Nothing that compares to Madness though
[01:09] <Shuri> KimiNewt fails again
[01:09] <KimiNewt> Why do you hate em so much
[01:09] <KimiNewt> fuck off shuri
[01:09] <Kab_Laptop> Because their songs are terrible
[01:09] <Kab_Laptop> No complex reasoning here
[01:09] <KimiNewt> Okay
[01:09] <Shuri> KimiNewt fails again!
[01:09] <Sea_Manky> YES! original voice and writing team!
[01:09] <KimiNewt> well I like them, no complex reasoning here either
[01:09] * Sea_Manky does the Bender
[01:10] <KimiNewt> We must agree to disagree?
[01:10] <Kab_Laptop> It would appear so
[01:10] <KimiNewt> You're the first person I've met to actively dislike them though I must add
[01:10] <bjork-wtf> hey wait
[01:10] <bjork-wtf> you just about go fuck yourself
[01:11] <bjork-wtf> Madness rules
[01:11] <KimiNewt> haha

[01:11] <KimiNewt> no one I asked did
[01:11] <stump> I hope Hedonismbot comes back.

[01:13] <KimiNewt> haha I love that one
[01:13] <KimiNewt> like I said earlier it's one of my favorites
[01:13] <KimiNewt> some israeli band copied that, really annoying, didn't credit them or anything
[01:13] <KimiNewt> it's practically identical and called "night -train- to cairo"
[01:13] <KimiNewt> they were all drunk in that vid btw
[01:13] <bjork-wtf> I would hope so
[01:14] <Wes> I seem to remember Suggs hosted a really crap TV show too so I didn't like them for that.
[01:14] <KimiNewt> dunno about that
[01:14] <KimiNewt> I just found their songs one day and started listening
[01:14] <bjork-wtf> I know Suggs had an awesome christmas single
[01:14] <bjork-wtf> can't find it anywhere though
[01:14] <Wes> ..yeah I'm listening to that Cairo song and no good memories are returning.
[01:15] <minty> !ping

[01:18] <KimiNewt> you know this shit reminds me
[01:18] <Shuri> its kinda like.. a Flight Sim-grade fps
[01:18] <Wes> Was Madness/Suggs ever associated with The Young Ones?
[01:18] <Shuri> you can design your own missions

[01:18] <bjork-wtf> wes> yeah, they were on two episodes
[01:18] <Shuri> theres a huge community of super hardcore people
[01:18] <bjork-wtf> they played House of Fun on the Boring episode and Our House on the Sick episode
[01:18] <Wes> thought so
[01:19] <Shuri> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhjAjZH4XCE
[01:19] <Wes> also, not enjoying that vid at all :|

[01:19] <bjork-wtf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QnebRstQa0
[01:19] <KimiNewt> what I love about house of fun is this line
[01:19] <Wes> Isn't ArmA2 supposed to be riddled with bugs?
[01:19] <KimiNewt> "Try the house of fun
[01:19] <KimiNewt> It's quicker if you run"
[01:19] <KimiNewt> ..It's quicker if you run - REALLY
[01:20] <Kab_Laptop> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=16243909&postcount=43 < Wes? :P
[01:20] <Wes> not that I remember
[01:20] <Wes> like i say my list was from memory
[01:21] <bjork-wtf> Young Ones is the best thing to ever be on TV btw
[01:21] <Wes> but I didn't know the exact chart positions of their discographies
[01:21] <Wes> so apparently I have no right to post in the thread ¬_¬
[01:21] <Armitage> kimi, you can't deny that it is quicker if youre running
[01:21] <Wes> I never really liked it.
[01:21] <Kab_Laptop> Google says she charted two songs at #7 in the UK after Saturday Night
[01:21] <Armitage> thats a fact
[01:21] <KimiNewt> it's true!
[01:21] <KimiNewt> It's just hilarious I found
[01:21] <Kab_Laptop> And another at #13, two at #21 etc. :P
[01:21] <Wes> But the University Challenge episode is great
[01:22] <Wes> Well my memory =/= google.
[01:22] <KimiNewt> They're churning the shit out of that fuck you very much song here on radio
[01:22] <KimiNewt> Well, at least I think you do
[01:22] <KimiNewt> they do
[01:22] <Wes> I only know the moves to Saturday Night, not any of her other stuff.
[01:22] <KimiNewt> because I've heard it twice and I never listen to radio
[01:22] <Kab_Laptop> Heh, guess that's why I remember Think of You best
[01:22] <Kab_Laptop> That actually charted higher here than Saturday NIhgt
[01:22] <Kab_Laptop> *Night
[01:23] <Wes> Saturday Night, Macarena - they're usually always played at cheesy student events at the end of the night when everyone is hammered
[01:24] <Wes> And at my student union every wednesday and friday night ends with a Queen song
[01:24] <Wes> never gets old
[01:24] <Kab_Laptop> Haha
[01:24] <Sea_Manky> I hate the macarena song
[01:25] <KimiNewt> Sometimes they have like music on at my school
[01:25] <KimiNewt> during breaks
[01:25] <KimiNewt> only song I ever recognized was I am the walrus
[01:26] <Wes> holy crap Emma Thompson was in The Young Ones
[01:26] <bjork-wtf> yep
[01:27] <bjork-wtf> House, too
[01:27] <bjork-wtf> and Edwina Monsoon
[01:27] <Wes> haha at the eclair

[01:30] <dead> jesus
[01:30] <dead> thats a ridiculous LE for a DS game
[01:30] <EviLore> damn
[01:31] <Kab_Laptop> Yeah, Sophie Ellis Bextor put out a lot of songs as evidenced by the frequent avatar changes of Dax1
[01:31] <dead> I have 3 of her albums lol
[01:32] <dead> 2nd album is really good, even has a song with Bernard Butler, the Suede guitarist
[01:32] <Wes> I think she's got a new one out this year
[01:32] <dead> I liked her from the first time I saw the murder on the dance floor video
[01:33] <Wes> youtube comments are great
[01:33] <Wes> "sophie ellis? bextor l love you , and would like to know her but i know is impossible."
[01:33] <dead> haha, youtube comments are just lol
[01:34] <dead> how can human beings output such nonsense
[01:34] <jakehk_suicidewatch> Not content with completing the signing of Kaka for a cool £59m, Real Madrid have turned their attention to Valencia striker David Villa. Returning president Florentino Perez has signalled his intention to keep spending by admitting he has enquired about Villa
[01:34] <Kab_Laptop> Funniest thing was when around christmas I watched the Heidi Klum - Wonderland video for lulz, and ALL the comments were racist ass shit about her being married to Seal lol
[01:35] * KimiNewt is now known as KimiSleep
[01:35] <KimiSleep> I have youtube comments removed
[01:35] <Wes> Kab if you like groovejet you'll probably like Modjo too
[01:35] <Wes> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzpCcNdhy5w
[01:35] <KimiSleep> hurray for greasemonkey
[01:35] <Kab_Laptop> Oooh, I remember that song
[01:35] <Kab_Laptop> That was a great song
[01:35] <Kab_Laptop> I need to bookmark that, perfect for summer :P
[01:35] <Wes> and Madison Avenue Don't Call Me Baby
[01:35] <KimiSleep> of course he had to be fed; I had to give him a bed
[01:35] <Wes> yeah those three were classic summer songs
[01:35] <KimiSleep> [he was the bed and breakfast man he was]
[01:35] <dead> man
[01:36] <dead> its such typical european music though
[01:36] <dead> that song you posted jsut now
[01:36] <dead> youd never hear that here in the US lol
[01:36] <Wes> typically good?
[01:36] <Kab_Laptop> Yes, it's much better than the summer music we've gotten since then Wes
[01:36] <Kab_Laptop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFzyYYZsxGc< Like this
[01:36] <KimiSleep> wes
[01:36] <dead> I didnt mean good or bad
[01:36] <Kab_Laptop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRx5PrAlUdY < Or of course this
[01:36] <KimiSleep> do people still use the V FU sign
[01:36] <Wes> :p
[01:36] <KimiSleep> or is that old news
[01:37] <dead> the funniest part of euro music
[01:37] <dead> is all those fad songs
[01:37] <Wes> The V's are considered a mild form of the middle finger
[01:37] <dead> and every country has their own
[01:37] <Wes> I think schoolkids still do it
[01:37] <Kab_Laptop> We win the fad song contest though
[01:37] <KimiSleep> like the V and that flip up
[01:37] <Wes> but most people outgrow it and just say the abuse to one another
[01:37] <Kab_Laptop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mex4ux1i1_U < This was a monster hit here a few summers ago, I'm absolutely not kidding in any way.

[01:54] <Tre`> to be fair
[01:54] <dead> you can tell who the 14 year olds are
[01:54] <Tre`> I'd imagine only the older ones are actually racist
[01:54] <dead> becuase they self censor

[01:59] <Wes> yeah how complex is it
[01:59] <stump> KimiSleep: I have a graph that is known to be homeomorphic but I require a simple algorithm to prove it is homeomorphic and demonstrate it visually.
[01:59] <Kab_Laptop> Yeah dead, that was amazing
[01:59] <stump> I last studied graph theory in 2003 so I can't fucking remember it at all.
[02:00] <jakehk_suicidewatch> yhelo olivia munn legs
[02:00] <KimiSleep> Can't help you
[02:00] <KimiSleep> sorry
[02:00] <Kab_Laptop> A dictionary would probably help me get much closer to solving the problem there stump
[02:00] <Wes> me neither
[02:00] <stump> I can assume (by properties of homeomorphic graphs) that the graph has some subset that is K5 or K3,3 but I don't know in advance which.

[02:01] <stump> Kab_Laptop: Imagine you have a graph with a bunch of points. On each point there's a tennis ball. Some of the tennis balls are connected to some of the other tennis balls with string. The strings are all tangled up. Move the points around so that none of the strings cross over each other. I can assume that it is possible to do this by the nature of the problem, but I need a simple and easy to execute way to actually do it.

[02:05] <KimiSleep> man I remember when we used to just get our computers and play WC3
[02:05] <stump> Kab_Laptop: If any chunk of the graph you're dealing with is set up like that first image, you're boned.

[02:06] <Kab_Laptop> That makes things a lot more clear actually, thanks :)
[02:06] <stump> Kab_Laptop: I am working with this particular problem, and I can prove that you can untangle it... I can't can't manage to untangle it myself, and that's the point of the problem :p
[02:07] <Kab_Laptop> I see
[02:07] <Kab_Laptop> Sadly, I don't think I'll be of any help :P
[02:07] <stump> That's ok.

[02:11] <Tre`> yeah
[02:11] <Tre`> and then I never pick it up again
[02:11] <KimiSleep> I played it for like 5 hours the first day, like 3 the next and another 3 afterwards
[02:11] <KimiSleep> haven't played it since
[02:11] <Tre`> I do acknowledge Sims 3 as a technical achievement
[02:11] <KimiSleep> some people can be obsessive about every little thing though
[02:11] <Tre`> the sims series in general
[02:11] <KimiSleep> so like going through a single families' life for them takes forever

[02:20] <Tre`> evilore:  let's seeeee
[02:20] <KimiSleep> Liberty of Norton Folgate
[02:20] <KimiSleep> totally
[02:20] <Tre`> mono - Under the Pipal Tree
[02:21] <Tre`> Mono - Hymn to the Immortal Wind
[02:21] <KimiSleep> because everyone likes Madness, except Kab
[02:21] <Wes> EviLore - check out the music draft thread
[02:21] <Wes> some interesting picks in there
[02:21] <Tre`> Jesu - Conqueror
[02:22] <Tre`> My Bloody Valentine - Loveless
[02:22] <Tre`> Boris with Michio Kurihara - Rainbow
[02:22] <Wes> Daft Punk - Alive
[02:22] <Tre`> Boris - Pink
[02:23] <BJ43> Shaquille O'Neal - Shaq Diesel
[02:23] <Tre`> Boris - Smile
[02:23] <stump> "My Bloody Valentine - Loveless" is pretty much the best album of that genre... Lo-fi-trip-hop-ish music. So, uh, without necessarily recommending the album by itself, it's definitely something to check out if you want to try that kind of music.
[02:23] <Tre`> The Black Keys -  Thickfreakness
[02:24] <Tre`> stump:  Music geeks just call it Shoegazer
[02:24] <Tre`> Shoegaze, even
[02:24] * Shuri has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[02:24] <KimiSleep> Why?
[02:24] <Tre`> Curtis Mayfield - Superfly
[02:24] <stump> Tre`: yeah but I didn't really want to use the Pitchfork Media word :p
[02:24] <Tre`> hahahaha
[02:24] <KimiSleep> What's the etymology for the nickname if you would
[02:24] <stump> Superfly is a totally awesome album.
[02:25] <KimiSleep> "shoegazing", that's interesting
[02:25] <Tre`> nobody knows why they call it shoegaze, there's a ton of different stories behind the word
[02:25] <Tre`> just like a lot of music genres
[02:25] <KimiSleep> lesse if wikipedia knows
[02:25] <stump> The popular folklore on it is that the bands were kinda like zombies on stage, just lifelessly playing staring at their shoes
[02:25] <stump> but I've never known if that's true or just a cool story.
[02:25] <dead> because the guitarists used to play while staring at the floor
[02:25] <dead> or their shoes
[02:25] <Tre`> dead:  that's one
[02:25] <dead> thats why it was coined like that
[02:26] <Tre`> or rather
[02:26] <Tre`> since they were looking at their pedalboards
[02:26] <fallout> while they went on long meandering bullshit noise sessions
[02:26] <dead> yeah that too
[02:26] <EviLore> k, tre, checking out all of those
[02:26] <BJ43> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WerzlLD3_0s <3 too many songs I don't like on the latest two Pet Shop Boys albums though to recommend them
[02:26] <KimiSleep> it does not know
[02:26] <Tre`> another is because the singers sung while looking at their shoes
[02:26] <Tre`> etc etc.
[02:26] <dead> If you want good shoegaze

[02:28] <EviLore> I put all my FLAC shit into 192 mp3 and organized everything in itunes.  16GB so far.  
[02:28] <fallout> it's sort of ... jazz fusion metal?

[02:39] <KimiSleep> well it has been nice meeting you but it's nearly 3 bloody am and shit I've school tomorrow - so 
[02:40] <stump> GaimeGuy I have a graph of n vertices which are connected by some edges (more edges than a sparse graph, fewer than a fully connected graph). The graph is not homeomorphic to K5 or K3,3 and thus can be arranged to be planar. I need an algorithm that is human-implementable to reorganize the vertices such that the resultant graph is planar.
[02:40] <KimiSleep> oh dear
[02:40] <stump> GaimeGuy: If you can't solve this in the next, say, 30 seconds you should probably quit your degree and go work at McDonalds.
[02:40] <GaimeGuy> ... FU

[02:47] <Armitage> go down to office depot and buy a few 1000 packs of paper
[02:47] <Armitage> and get drawing!
[02:48] <stump> It'd be faster to literally copy this shit down, write a program to bruteforce configurations, and then write the answer down myself when it's done :p
[02:48] <GaimeGuy> i'm noindeed
[02:48] <Armitage> using computers eh?  kids these days
[02:48] <GaimeGuy> *indeed
[02:49] <Armitage> back when i was a travelling salesman i did it all by hand!
[02:49] <Armitage> and we liked it that way!
[02:49] <GaimeGuy>  see what u did there
[02:49] <Takuan> oh, fantastic. i think i just saw tubgirl
[02:49] <GaimeGuy> i see what u did there
[02:49] <Takuan> guess it was just a matter of time.
[02:50] <GaimeGuy> and luck
[02:51] <stump> Takuan: did you see a woman projectile-shitting a fountain of diarrhea onto herself while lying in a tub?
[02:51] <bjork-wtf> tubguy is way cooler
[02:52] <KimiSleepHonestly> holy shit that's what it is?
[02:52] <GaimeGuy> yes
[02:52] <GaimeGuy> a lot of it
[02:52] <KimiSleepHonestly> I'm so happy I managed to escape that crap, goatse mostly included
[02:52] <Sea_Manky> managed to escape?
[02:52] <Sea_Manky> you're still here!
[02:52] <Sea_Manky> like tak said, it's simply a matter of time
[02:52] <bjork-wtf> goatse is so tame
[02:53] <stump> i think the only picture i ever saw that bothered me visually was a picture of a japanese woman in high heels curb-stomping a kitten with her high heel. That fucking sucked and that's an image that when it pops in my head I feel kinda uneasy :(
[02:53] <bjork-wtf> I was more tramuatized by seeing the mythbuster guy's bunghole tbh
[02:53] <GaimeGuy> wtf
[02:53] <GaimeGuy> :(
[02:53] <stump> bjork-wtf: you do know that's not him, right? :p
[02:53] <Sea_Manky> glassinmyass.com is the new hotness :D~~~~~
[02:53] <KimiSleepHonestly> can't think of anything
[02:53] <GaimeGuy> ow
[02:53] <bjork-wtf> it's close enough for me to never unsee it
[02:53] <stump> ahahah
[02:53] <GaimeGuy> why would u do  thatt
[02:53] <KimiSleepHonestly> I managed to not see any of that shit, but it is a matter of time
[02:53] <Sea_Manky> stump: You saw a picture of that?  I saw the video.  VERY hard to watch. :|
[02:54] <Sea_Manky> the bit where she popped the eyeball out with her heel
[02:54] <stump> Sea_Manky: see, I don't get how anyone can be shocked by a video because you can always just pause it.
[02:54] <Armitage> oh god
[02:54] <Armitage> glass in my ass
[02:54] <Armitage> the broken bottle
[02:54] <Armitage> oh god
[02:54] <stump> Sea_Manky: 78sy78dysd7f8
[02:54] <GaimeGuy> why would u do  that
[02:54] <Sea_Manky> glassinmyass is the laugh riot of the new willennium
[02:55] <Tre`> note: Sea_Manky does not have your best interests at heart
[02:55] <Sea_Manky> any of you stupid enough to visit sites mentioned during a conversation on shock sites deserves every last bit of pain
[02:55] <Armitage> i've seen it before
[02:55] <Sea_Manky> or comedy, in the case of glassinmyass! :D
[02:55] <Armitage> i didn't click on it now
[02:55] <Armitage> never will
[02:55] <Pimpbaa> just show yourself doing something absolutely disgusting with one of your naughty parts and you can be an internet celebrity too
[02:56] <Sea_Manky> not good enough, unless it involves a barbeque fork
[02:56] <bjork-wtf> I'm waiting for the inevitable "slap chop meets penis" videos
[02:56] <stump> haahhah
[02:56] <stump> I don't watch any body modification stuff
[02:56] <Sea_Manky> there's already penis mutilation
[02:57] <bjork-wtf> yeah, but manky
[02:57] <bjork-wtf> slap, bam. you got slices
[02:57] <Sea_Manky> yeah yeah, you're gonna love my nuts
[02:57] <bjork-wtf> another slap, bang. ice cream topping
[02:57] <Sea_Manky> basic flaw in your idea, how is the slap chop supposed to work when the penis is still attached to the body?
[02:57] <Tre`> manky is a master of guro
[02:57] <Tre`> you can't beat him at this
[02:58] <Sea_Manky> damn right
[02:58] <GaimeGuy> <Sea_Manky> there's already penis mutilation
[02:58] <GaimeGuy> only once, actually
[02:58] <BJ43> BME Pain Olympics
[02:58] <GaimeGuy> oh, already != always
[02:58] * GaimeGuy replaces eyes
[02:58] <bjork-wtf> what do you mean? you stick your dick on a table and slap chop it
[02:58] <Sea_Manky> half of that is fake, iirc
[02:58] <bjork-wtf> it's just not in the little cup thing
[02:58] <Tre`> you guys are arguing with the wrong guy on mutilation
[02:59] <Tre`> It'd be like arguing with gaime on being a loser.
[02:59] <Sea_Manky> I don't think the blades come down below the edges of the cup, so you would be failing to properly chop
[02:59] <bjork-wtf> we need to experiment
[02:59] <KimiSleepHonestly> I like how I'm gonna go to sleep with those thoughts in mind
[02:59] <itsgreen> nice..!
[02:59] <Sea_Manky> no you aren't. :D

[03:39] <Tre`> marvin gaye was shot by his dad
[03:39] <Tre`> over money
[03:39] <Tre`> fucking senseless
[03:39] <Lo-Volt> I like Mayfield's take on If There's a Hell Below.
[03:39] <WasabiKing> he did, then released an album
[03:39] <Lo-Volt> That's a good one.
[03:39] <WasabiKing> he was shot by a shotgun too
[03:39] <warcock-tf2> my dad is gay

[03:40] <warcock-tf2> if they wanted to
[03:40] <Lo-Volt> That's why they lost, possibly.
[03:41] <warcock-tf2> yes in some respect
[03:41] <warcock-tf2> shite, sunni and christians allied
[03:41] <warcock-tf2> to defeat the shite majority

[03:44] <Tre`> osaka:  it's basically ranked mode
[03:44] <Tre`> a new ranked mode
[03:44] <Takuan> yeah, i don't understand it either
[03:44] <Lo-Volt> Great commercial for them, but it's odd to watch.

[03:44] <Takuan> i juts keep playing
[03:44] <Tre`> you start up a match at the bottom rung of a tournament
[03:44] <Tre`> if you win
[03:44] <Tre`> you go to the next round
[03:44] <Tre`> but it's all seperated
[03:44] <Takuan> 3 rounds total, at least in my tier
[03:44] <Tre`> it's just a new way of matchmaking, really
[03:44] <warcock-tf2> yeah bu bu bu tre
[03:44] <warcock-tf2> its kof...
[03:44] <Tre`> warcock:  :shrug
[03:44] <Tre`> it's got CCs man
[03:44] <Tre`> you'll like it
[03:44] <Takuan> Tre`: what's after G-grade
[03:44] <warcock-tf2> beh
[03:44] <Tre`> like 65% damage CCs
[03:44] <osaka> so the opponent is picked from the pool of players who won their "first match", for the second match
[03:44] <Takuan> what are CCs
[03:44] <Tre`> yeah osaka, exactly
[03:45] <osaka> but i dont know what the hell are the CP's
[03:45] <Tre`> custom combos
[03:45] <Takuan> oh.
[03:45] <Takuan> i never had the reflexes to pull those off properly
[03:45] <Tre`> your CPs is the amount of your opponent's GP in the first match
[03:45] <Tre`> then you get their CPs in the next round
[03:45] <Tre`> if you win
[03:45] <osaka> and does it affect anything
[03:45] <warcock-tf2> takuanL it takes lost of practice
[03:45] <Lo-Volt> Curtis Mayfield had ten children?
[03:45] <Takuan> i remember viewing cc combos for SFA2 and trying to emulate... fale
[03:45] <Tre`> until the finals
[03:45] <Lo-Volt> Damn.
[03:45] <Tre`> more CPs = more GP when you win a tournament
[03:45] <osaka> ah
[03:45] <osaka> right
[03:45] <warcock-tf2> sfa 2 ccs are easy
[03:45] <warcock-tf2> cuz they so fucking short
[03:45] <EviLore> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=16229704&postcount=33   <---yikes
[03:45] <osaka> and when i get enough GP's i move to like, G3-B or whatever?
[03:45] <warcock-tf2> alpha 3 has challenging CCs
[03:45] <Tre`> the amount of CP you have in the final also determines if you can upload a replay
[03:46] <osaka> or do i go to G2 when i win a tournament
[03:46] <Takuan> ah
[03:46] <Tre`> there's no grade above G, bte
[03:46] <Takuan> wtf
[03:46] <Tre`> you go to G3-B
[03:46] <Takuan> lame
[03:46] <Tre`> it's just G3
[03:46] <Tre`> G2
[03:46] <Tre`> G1
[03:46] <Tre`> GS
[03:46] <osaka> G means Grade i guess
[03:46] <osaka> :/
[03:46] <Takuan> oh, ok
[03:46] <Tre`> yeah
[03:46] <osaka> so um
[03:46] <BJ43> You haven't seen that vid, Evi?
[03:46] <osaka> you just rise G3-D to A
[03:46] <Tre`> evilore:  Sea_manky am happy
[03:46] <osaka> then you rise to G2-D
[03:46] <osaka> and so on?

[03:46] <osaka> well yeah w/e
[03:47] <Takuan> I wish they'd make a Samurai Shodown game with the KOFXII engine.
[03:47] <osaka> Tre`: it's really fucking annoying though
[03:47] <osaka> i've played only against people that i know i could beat if it didnt lag so much
[03:47] <Takuan> Even if it was a carbon copy of any of the current games, I think I'd buy it.
[03:47] <osaka> balrog is so annoying to play as when it's laggy
[03:47] <osaka> timing goes all fubar
[03:47] <warcock-tf2> what time does the laker game start
[03:47] <warcock-tf2> ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt

[04:01] <warcock-tf2> justin wong is still intact
[04:01] <warcock-tf2> its so temptiing to just break him in half
[04:01] <Kagari> I wish Verizon had the iPhone
[04:02] <warcock-tf2> with his snobby attitude
[04:02] <Kagari> can't switch carriers either
[04:02] <Takuan> EviLore: 3G or 3rd gen? heh
[04:02] <warcock-tf2> yet hes not scarred
[04:02] <Takuan> I'm pretty certain the iPhones here are 3G already
[04:02] <EviLore> 3GS, like I said tak.  the new one.  
[04:02] <Takuan> new features?
[04:02] <Takuan> hardware?
[04:03] <EviLore> oh, you just left your cave
[04:03] <Tre`> Like stump said, evil, Loveless is kinda the pinnacle of the genre
[04:03] <TToB> Justin Wong cracks me up from the videos I've seen him. Chubby azn gangsta wannabe. I suspect he's just tired of the jocks at school giving him flagpole wedgies.
[04:03] <Takuan> i read nothinig about the apple conference
[04:03] <HadesGigas> this info can't be found anywhere on the internet, give us the scoop
[04:03] <Tre`> MVC2 players are so funny

[04:03] <Tre`> just look at that dark prince video
[04:03] <warcock-tf2> dark prince ftw
[04:03] <Tre`> oh my god
[04:03] <EviLore> it's an iphone 3G with better performance, better camera (w/ video) and 16gb/32gb capacity

[04:03] <Takuan> whoa. compass.
[04:04] <TToB> It's a huge fucking upgrade over my OG iPhone.
[04:04] <Takuan> maybe i'll upgrayyde
[04:04] <Jide> when you americans trash talk 
[04:04] <Takuan> though i like my berry.

[04:19] <warcock-tf2> no
[04:19] <warcock-tf2> dx 10 lol
[04:19] <warcock-tf2> im not sure what that means
[04:19] * Tiduz\` has joined #GA
[04:19] <Pimpbaa> it's fully backwards compatible with the crappy old PowerVR MBX in the old iphones and ipod touch
[04:20] <EviLore> dude, being a dx10 chipset doesn't NECESSARILY mean that it's powerful.  doesn't mean it can run crysis at very high.  it just means it has support for dx10 features
[04:20] <Pimpbaa> it means that the iphone went from sub psp level graphics to bitch slapping the psp many times over graphics
[04:20] <minty> powervr? easy dc ports? shenmoooo~
[04:20] <warcock-tf2> yeah i assumed it meant something like that
[04:21] <EviLore> so the 3GS has this chipset?

[04:54] <Takuan> The locales are really wonderful
[04:54] <FirewalkR> EGM92: coz everytime felgueiras is on the news, is due to political corruption :D
[04:54] <minty> and waggle+
[04:54] <EGM92> again another reason why I got the fuck out of there
[04:54] <Takuan> every politician is corrupt... it's impossible not to be
[04:54] <EGM92> there's also a massive drug problem with that fucking country.
[04:54] <Takuan> too many interests you have to juggle and balance
[04:55] <FirewalkR> still speak portuguese?
[04:55] <EGM92> of course I do.
[04:55] <minty> isn't portuguese simliar to spanish?

[04:59] <EGM92> I'm in Canada.

[04:59] <darkh23> woo
[04:59] <warcock-tf2> how the fuck is canada
[04:59] <EGM92> raised in Barcelona, Braga, Sao miguel
[04:59] <warcock-tf2> the best country to live in
[04:59] <Unison> woo
[04:59] <FirewalkR> sao miguel? azores?
[05:00] <EGM92> yes
[05:00] <warcock-tf2> its so lame
[05:00] <warcock-tf2> i dont like los angeles but i would never go back to montreal 
[05:00] <EGM92> then I was in Saudi Arabia for a couple of years.
[05:00] <FirewalkR> hell... i'm like felgueiras, braga. suddenly the word hell feels appropriate :D
[05:00] <EGM92> then moved to Montreal and never looked back.
[05:01] <FirewalkR> EGM92, canada is probably better than most places from what i her
[05:01] <FirewalkR> hear
[05:01] <warcock-tf2> .....
[05:01] <warcock-tf2> liberturds
[05:01] <EGM92> it's a hell of a lot better than where you're at.
[05:01] <FirewalkR> i believe you
[05:01] <warcock-tf2> possibly i wont argue
[05:01] <warcock-tf2> that
[05:01] <warcock-tf2> cuz portugal is poor compared to the rest of europe
[05:01] <warcock-tf2> but
[05:01] <warcock-tf2> uh canada.
[05:02] <warcock-tf2> its peaceful.
[05:02] <FirewalkR> portugal is kinda cool because no one messes with us (because no one cares)
[05:02] <FirewalkR> its also peaceful
[05:02] <EGM92> fuck you and your fucking military
[05:02] <FirewalkR> but quality of life must be waaaay higher in canada
[05:02] <FirewalkR> haha, military
[05:02] <FirewalkR> i avoided it
[05:02] <EGM92> pussy.
[05:02] <FirewalkR> :D

[05:04] <EGM92> yea. NOWADAYS.
[05:04] <FirewalkR> a few years ago (when i had to go to the "inspection") it was obligatory
[05:04] <FirewalkR> u went to the military here=
[05:04] <FirewalkR> ?
[05:05] <EGM92> as soon as I got off the plane.
[05:05] <FirewalkR> how old were you when u got here?
[05:05] <Tre`> And tell me friend

[05:06] * fallout has joined #GA
[05:06] <FirewalkR> well... in terms of military it's better these days.
[05:06] <FirewalkR> i got lucky
[05:06] <EGM92> yea.... call me when you've done survival training / war games.
[05:07] <FirewalkR> lots of people didn't go to the military due to favours and/or "cunhas" (i assume u're familiar with the term)
[05:07] <EGM92> cunhas... no not familar.
[05:08] <FirewalkR> cunhas... bribes
[05:08] <EGM92> Not really one of my everyday words...
[05:09] <FirewalkR> it's a very well known word over here... in terms of ... corruption/favours-related fame, i'd say the only european country that beats us, is italy
[05:09] <EGM92> you hear that cock?!
[05:10] <FirewalkR> Warcock? he's offline :)
[05:10] <FirewalkR> italian?

[05:11] <FirewalkR> 3:11 AM
[05:11] <EGM92> oops clocks wrong. 
[05:12] <FirewalkR> still, egm... in terms of life opportunities and quality... yeah, portugal sucks compared to many countries, especially canada probably. but in terms of peacefulness... is ok. violent crimes have been on the rise in the last few years... but still...
[05:12] <GaimeGuy> that's your fault
[05:13] <FirewalkR> gaime ur alive xD

[05:21] <darkh23> shot a 74 on St. Andrews in frisbee golf
[05:21] <Unison> :USA USA USA:
[05:21] <GaimeGuy> yyay
[05:21] <darkh23> was getting the hang of it...it really requires nice finesse
[05:21] <darkh23> its awesome
[05:21] <Tre`> FirewalkR:  Bitch please
[05:21] <Tre`> you're on my turf
[05:22] <darkh23> you gotta throw it like a real frisbee or you fucked
[05:22] <Tre`> There's only room for one sim racing snob in the channel
[05:22] <FirewalkR> what u mean Tre`... tell me, tell me about sim racing
[05:22] <Tre`> GTFO
[05:22] <FirewalkR> ha ha
[05:22] <Tre`> You mean like my copies of GTR2 and GT Legends
[05:22] <Tre`> rFactor
[05:22] <Tre`> my beta testing of iracing
[05:22] <Tre`> what you wanna hear
[05:23] <FirewalkR> tried rfactor a bit, never tried iracing... played gtr2 a bit... i gotta find my gtr2 cd (when i bought it my pc couldn't handle it properly)
[05:23] <FirewalkR> lfs all the way
[05:23] <FirewalkR> lfs still has *the* best online mode/community
[05:23] <Tre`> iracing >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> *
[05:23] <minty> tre plays gtr2 with his keyboard
[05:23] <Tre`> as far as driving model goes
[05:23] <FirewalkR> i hear very good things about iracing
[05:23] <Tre`> iracing's formula mazda
[05:23] <Tre`> real sex
[05:23] <Tre`> in a digital car
[05:24] <Tre`> gave me goose bumps
[05:24] <Tre`> also, has the best laguna seca
[05:24] <Tre`> I've ever raced
[05:24] <jett> do you pay for iracing tre?
[05:24] <FirewalkR> minty: one guy in my team played LFS with the keyboard. he was (and i'm not exagerating) probably the best keyboard player in the world... unbelievable really
[05:24] <Tre`> most treacherous corkscrew
[05:24] <Tre`> byfar
[05:24] <Tre`> there are some sick key players
[05:24] <Tre`> I can't do it though haha
[05:24] <Tre`> jett:  I don't but yes, it is subscription based
[05:24] <Tre`> subscription + microrapetions
[05:24] <Tre`> it is SUPER EXPENSIVE
[05:24] <Tre`> but it is oh so good
[05:24] <FirewalkR> it all depends on how the game interprets the keyboard input
[05:24] <jett> it's like $150 a year
[05:25] <jett> fuck it
[05:25] <Tre`> yeah
[05:25] <FirewalkR> yeah, i don't like the iRacing subscription model
[05:25] <Tre`> it is so so so so good though
[05:25] <FirewalkR> mainly why i haven't tried it yet
[05:25] <Tre`> I don't think I'd pay for it
[05:25] <FirewalkR> but i may try it
[05:25] <jett> + you only get like 3 tracks or something
[05:25] <Tre`> but I dunno
[05:25] <Tre`> it depends on how much you're into competitive racing
[05:25] <Tre`> if you want a true simulation of league racing
[05:25] <Tre`> with ladders and all that shit
[05:25] <FirewalkR> Tre`: sim quality is really better?
[05:25] <Tre`> the driving model is truly superb
[05:25] <FirewalkR> i'm talking physics
[05:25] <Tre`> yes
[05:26] <FirewalkR> i'll have to try it
[05:26] <Tre`> I've played LFS
[05:26] <Tre`> Demo (lulz!)
[05:26] <FirewalkR> demo *can* be cool
[05:26] <Tre`> yeah
[05:26] <Tre`> I've played most of the modern sims of the past 4-ish years
[05:26] <FirewalkR> if you find good people, but there can be lots of crashers/wreckers
[05:26] <Tre`> except for some of the oval racing ones
[05:26] <Orin_Hamma> dont hit me with your fears, I wont think with your ideas, you missed what Im about, i earned my way out, and in the end, I say goodbye again
[05:26] <Tre`> Race WTCC, etc
[05:26] <FirewalkR> oval sucks Tre`
[05:26] <Tre`> haha
[05:26] <Tre`> I am not into ovals
[05:27] <FirewalkR> u should buy LFS S2, it's kinda cheap
[05:27] <Tre`> My wheel died last year
[05:27] <Tre`> so I've been sim racingless for awhile
[05:27] <FirewalkR> LFS vs iRacing, physics-wise, what would u say?
[05:27] <Takuan> http://www.aintitcool.com/images2009/WhiplashSm.jpg wtf
[05:27] <Tre`> I would definitely give it to iracing
[05:28] <FirewalkR> and LFS has changed a little bit since last year... but not significantly
[05:28] <Tre`> like I said, the formula mazda gave me goosebumps
[05:28] <Tre`> like while I was driving it on...Road America? I think
[05:28] <Tre`> I was truly thrilled driving it
[05:28] <Tre`> incredible sense of speed and feel
[05:28] <FirewalkR> oh I just loved to hear the forza 3 guys talking about "tyre deformation"... damn, LFS has had it for years
[05:28] <Tre`> ironically enough
[05:28] <FirewalkR> well, the sense of speed pretty much depends on the field of view... you can configure it in LFS too heh
[05:28] <Tre`> it was driving the formula mazda on road america when my wheel died
[05:29] <Tre`> :/
[05:29] <minty> rip
[05:29] <EviLore> hrm itunes is growing on me a little
[05:29] <Tre`> soon evilore will sell his PC rig and get a mac pro
[05:29] <FirewalkR> forza FAILS a lot because stupid MS doesn't allow for Logitech wheels :(
[05:29] <EviLore> hardly!
[05:29] <minty> uhoh
[05:29] <Tre`> well firewalkr
[05:29] <Tre`> there's the Fanatech wheels
[05:29] <FirewalkR> i know
[05:29] <FirewalkR> are they any good?
[05:29] <EviLore> but since I'm stuck with it if I get an iphone, yeah, I'm getting used to it and all
[05:30] <FirewalkR> i got a DFP
[05:30] <Tre`> I've heard nothing but good about the fanatec stuff
[05:30] <Tre`> I'm going to get one of their cheap wheels once I get the cash
[05:30] <Tre`> 130$
[05:30] <Takuan> ah, SHIT
[05:30] <Tre`> comes with H shifter
[05:30] <Takuan> i missed duchovny on conan
[05:30] <Tre`> clutch
[05:30] <FirewalkR> that fanatec wheel the forza guys rave about, is it better than G25?
[05:30] <FirewalkR> duchovny on conan???? i'll download it STAT
[05:30] <Tre`> I heard the pedals on the G25 feel better
[05:30] <minty> of course
[05:30] <minty> g25>fanta
[05:30] <Tre`> however
[05:31] <Tre`> Fanatec makes those 200$ clubsport pedals
[05:31] <Tre`> all metal
[05:31] <FirewalkR> microsoft is really missing out on not supporting logitech
[05:31] <Tre`> they look *sexy*
[05:31] <Tre`> but those are PS3/PC only
[05:31] <FirewalkR> i actually bought Forza 2, but didn't play much
[05:31] <minty> flopza2 ;<
[05:31] <FirewalkR> i played GT5P a lot more... had a few world records... but they're probably long gone now:)
[05:32] <minty> turn10's pr machine going all out now. i really think this is do or die for turn10
[05:32] <EviLore> I don't tend to set any records on game leaderboards
[05:32] <FirewalkR> well, Tre` if you ever decide to buy LFS S2, search for Takahashi, that's me
[05:32] <minty> takahashi..
[05:32] * minty slaps FirewalkR around a bit with a large trout
[05:32] <EviLore> but I was the first person to finish most of the Lemmings PS3 levels, heh.
[05:32] <Tre`> k
[05:32] <TToB> OH GOD YES!
[05:32] <FirewalkR> EviLore I tend to set records on GT... but I'm awesome
[05:32] <TToB> Streets of Fire OST
[05:32] <Tre`> It'll have to wait until I get a wheel though!
[05:33] <TToB> Boyoiyoiyoiyoing!
[05:33] <minty> it's only $130
[05:33] <FirewalkR> minty: yep, takahashi, directly from Initial D
[05:33] <minty> go sell your school textbooks and buy one
[05:33] <Tre`> I'm about to spend 106$ on a yoyo :(
[05:33] <jakehk_suicidewatch> slap yourself
[05:33] <minty> wtf
[05:33] * EviLore slaps tre
[05:33] <Tre`> IT'S SO SEXY THOUGH
[05:33] <minty> i thought you was getting that cheapo version
[05:33] <jakehk_suicidewatch> slap yourself
[05:33] <Tre`> http://i710.photobucket.com/albums/ww109/general-yo/FSTARGREEN.jpg

[05:34] <Tre`> only 100 made
[05:34] <minty> ..
[05:34] <Tre`> going to sell out super quick
[05:34] <FirewalkR> Lemmings PS3?...  oh right, i got the demo... didn't even remember it anymore
[05:34] <Tre`> look at those fucking curves man
[05:34] <Tre`> that's just sexy design
[05:34] <FirewalkR> i had Lemmings 2 on the Amiga a LOT of years ago... first game i actually bought i think
[05:34] <TToB> Fuck
[05:34] <TToB> Adblocking god awful FUGLY SHIT SFEX4 avatars is busy work
[05:34] <FirewalkR> at the time, piracy was so common and widespread, that stores actually sold copies of games
[05:35] <FirewalkR> u just had to get to a store, pick the games u wanted from the list, they'd copy them on the spot... and you were set
[05:35] <Pimpbaa> admit it TToB, it's you favorite game
[05:35] <Tre`> http://generalyo.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/color_combos.156211024.JPG
[05:35] <FirewalkR> when I got an Amiga (aka best gaming device ever)... that kind of stuff was disappearing
[05:36] <TToB> Pimpbaa: No. I can play SF2 without shitty 3D graphics thanks!

[05:49] <Somnia> haha pimp
[05:49] <Tre`> having just played Tekken 5 DR
[05:49] <Tre`> Tekken 6 is a pretty big graphical upgrade
[05:49] <Tre`> Motion blur mmm
[05:49] <MarkMan> tekken changes a lot, between each iteration
[05:49] <Somnia> Red Steel 2 is a big maybe
[05:49] <MarkMan> the regular joe schmoe gamer isnt gonna know that
[05:49] <Somnia> like HUGE maybe

[05:50] <TToB> MarkMan: You know what else is popular? Lady gaga - SO GO FUCK YOURSELF! ;)
[05:50] <jett> i'd buy tekken 6 on psn
[05:50] <jett> for 20 bucks
[05:50] <jett> do it namco
[05:50] <Tre`> if tekken 6 has like
[05:50] <Tre`> the kumite-esque mode
[05:50] <MarkMan> TToB: thats cool, go buy a psp go
[05:50] <MarkMan> tekken 6 is awesome

[05:53] <jman2050> haha Somnia
[05:54] <MarkMan> yea, MS money hats must be delaying it, especially since it runs smoother on the 360 now right?
[05:54] <TToB> MarkMan: Doesn't matter to me. :p
[05:54] <MarkMan> thats cool

[05:54] <Somnia> GO ORLANDO
[05:54] * Lo-Volt has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[05:54] <TToB> MarkMan: Can't. Hand will get stuck in hair. :o
[05:55] <TToB> Fighting games I currently give a shit about - KoF12 / BB.
[05:55] <MarkMan> i have BB right now
[05:55] <MarkMan> its awesome
[05:55] <jett> i don't get why scamco is wasting their time with another tekken force
[05:55] <MarkMan> KOF12 not so much
[05:55] <jett> that shit has always sucked
[05:55] <jett> always
[05:55] <jett> alwas
[05:55] <jett> always
[05:55] <Pimpbaa> tekken bowling is where it's at
[05:56] <MarkMan> blazblue looks way better
[05:56] <TToB> Yeah, I'm hearing lukewarm things about KoF12; but do not care. 
[05:56] <MarkMan> than KOF XII
[05:56] <Tre`> I cannot stand arc sys games
[05:56] <Tre`> really cannot
[05:56] <Tre`> I can't stand KOF either
[05:56] <jett> tekken 6 should have lots of arcade games like tekken 5 on the ps2
[05:56] <TToB> Errrr - I really, really dislike the BB character designs. So KoF12 wins that round.
[05:56] <Pimpbaa> ttob: i blame the lack of mai and too many queers in the roster
[05:56] <Tre`> but KOF has shen woo and what looks to be decent online
[05:56] <Tre`> so
[05:56] <Pimpbaa> not that there is anything wrong with being queer
[05:56] <jett> arc sys sucks
[05:56] <MarkMan> character designs, thats what makes a fighting game am i rite?
[05:56] <TToB> Pimpbaa: Ash is only one queer. And Gaime knows there's nothing wrong with being gay.
[05:56] <Tre`> also blazblue has TOO MUCH TALKING
[05:56] <MarkMan> blazblue system is pretty cool though
[05:57] <Tre`> HOLY SHIT
[05:57] <minty> yup that settles it. jett says it sucks. game ova mang
[05:57] <Tre`> even if you can mute it
[05:57] <Tre`> GOD DAMN
[05:57] <jett> Duo Lon is pretty faggy-looking

[05:58] <TToB> MarkMan: Sheeeeeeit!
[05:58] <jman2050> not really
[05:58] <Tre`> let me get you a clip
[05:58] <jakehk_suicidewatch> anything that nominates modern warefare 2 is shit
[05:58] <jett> the characters in blazblue have a line for every character
[05:58] <jett> er
[05:58] <jett> every move
[05:58] <jman2050> never was too interested in it, and it's not like I've been able to play it
[05:58] <MarkMan> i bet it's a bang match
[05:58] <MarkMan> bang talks a LOT
[05:58] <TToB> MarkMan: Sorry, try now.
[05:58] <Tre`> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q9nAYXKsO8 -- jman
[05:58] <Tre`> it is a bang match

[05:59] <Tre`> bang and carl
[05:59] <MarkMan> well yea

[06:00] <jman2050> that's no worse than marvel or guilty gear
[06:00] <Tre`> Marvel doesn't really have much speaking in it
[06:00] <Tre`> Guilty Gear on the other hand
[06:00] <MarkMan> i prefer BB shit over storm screamin in the background
[06:00] <Tre`> is also an Arc Sys game
[06:00] <kas_> was watching at a bar a Philly airport
[06:00] <Tre`> marvel is mostly like grunts and shit
[06:00] <jman2050> and it sounds just as annoying
[06:00] <jakehk_suicidewatch> nice
[06:01] <Tre`> maybe the occasional move like HADOKEN or whatever the fuck

[06:03] <Tre`> KOF is going to totally bomb in the US
[06:03] <jman2050> is KOF a SF clone or SF a KOF clone?
[06:03] <Tre`> KOF is only big with spanish speaking people and korea/china
[06:03] <jman2050> or does it depend on who you ask?
[06:03] <TToB> KoF came after SF.

[06:04] <Tre`> markman:  why does no one on TekkenZaibatsu ever link to the gajillion T6BR matches on nicovideo
[06:04] <jman2050> that's cause SFIV lacks substantial otaku fanwank
[06:04] <TToB> WTF is Gundam Vs Gundam?
[06:04] <jman2050> too much western style fankwank
[06:04] <jman2050> -k
[06:04] <MarkMan> because TZ is noob central right now
[06:04] <TToB> jman2050: Bullshit. 
[06:04] <Tre`> oh
[06:04] <MarkMan> i dl them and upload them to my youtube when im not lazy
[06:04] <TToB> jman2050: SFEX4 has shitty loli characters to appease Japan.
[06:05] <Tre`> is there any non-noob tekken fansite
[06:05] <MarkMan> most of them end up on youtube too
[06:05] <TToB> Sakura = BARF!
[06:05] <SeraphicHeat> Sakura isnt loli wtf
[06:05] <TToB> KEEP THE LITTLE GIRLS OUT OF MY GOD DAMN FIGHTING GAMES! >:(
[06:05] <jman2050> Sakura is pretty much the only otaku fanwank in the game
[06:05] <jman2050> and wtf she's not loli
[06:05] <MarkMan> gameplay wise?  probably not, TZ is good for T5 and T6BR though, check the character discussion forums

[06:05] <Tre`> hmmm k
[06:05] <Tre`> I think frame data is several months away for me haha
[06:06] <MarkMan> i have a frame data guide too
[06:06] <MarkMan> which is pretty helpful imo
[06:06] <TToB> Frame Data = The reason online fighting games will always be doomed.
[06:06] <Tre`> I'm am sub-scrub in Tekken
[06:06] <MarkMan> http://sdtekken.com/t5dr/frame-data-guide/
[06:06] <Tre`> I'd be like someone's mom playing tekken
[06:06] <Tre`> that's about where I'm at right now
[06:06] <TToB> At least until every gamer has fiber optic connections. :p
[06:06] <jman2050> Tre: sounds like me on Soul Calibur
[06:07] <TToB> I really want to love online fighters since arcades are FUCKING DEAD, but ugh - every one I've played has been varying degrees of shit.
[06:07] <MarkMan> i hate online fighting games
[06:07] <MarkMan> well
[06:07] <MarkMan> i hate tekken online
[06:07] <MarkMan> lol
[06:08] <MarkMan> thats why i love going to conventions and tournaments
[06:08] <MarkMan> play some real ppl
[06:08] <jman2050> online infrastructure isn't good enough for fighting games yet
[06:08] <jman2050> sad truth
[06:09] <jman2050> I wonder what the next big revolution in fighting games would be
[06:09] <Hitokage> 4D!
[06:10] <jman2050> I mean, the SF2 model is great, but I haven't seen much departure from it after 15 years
[06:10] <MarkMan> i dont think there will ever be a revolution in fighting games
[06:10] <MarkMan> it is what it is, anything beyond that would be creating a whole new genre
[06:10] <jman2050> the only real departures have been very major in nature, like smash brothers or power stone
[06:10] <MarkMan> and those aren't considered 'real' fighting games, yet they share the same competitive passion
[06:11] <jman2050> I guess the fanbase is part of the problem
[06:11] <Tre`> that'd be like saying what's the next revolution in racing games
[06:11] <jman2050> well I think racing games have a similar problem, though really that genre is much much narrower in scope
[06:12] <Pimpbaa> the next revolution in racing games is forza 3!  the definitive racer!
[06:12] <Pimpbaa> tire deformation!
[06:12] <jman2050> the one thing I can think of is creating new types of vehicles that are raced differently from what one is used to, but that would be difficult
[06:12] <pj> even PD takes notes i hear
[06:13] <jman2050> since then that removes the whole familiarity aspect
[06:15] <avcables> fuck

[06:33] <Shinobi_F1> haha
[06:33] <fallout> and he usually took a decent break
[06:33] <Shinobi_F1> drew up the plays too
[06:33] <WasabiKing> nah see, bron gets shit cause he's playing in cleveland
[06:33] <Shinobi_F1> ran the drills
[06:33] <WasabiKing> lol
[06:33] <Shinobi_F1> haha
[06:33] <Somnia> Dont worry sabi your raiders will get back to the playoffs before dallas wins another playoff game =)
[06:33] <fallout> basically sat on the bench at the start of the half to fetch the guys some water
[06:33] <Shinobi_F1> that's some mad hate
[06:33] <WasabiKing> and that's why mike brown doesn't deserve coach of the year
[06:33] <jman2050> Cleveland is lulz
[06:33] <jman2050> seriously
[06:33] <Shinobi_F1> imagine if michael jordan played in cleveland
[06:34] <Shinobi_F1> or magic johnson
[06:34] <jman2050> they have to be cursed
[06:34] <WasabiKing> what the fuck did that dude do
[06:34] <Shinobi_F1> you'd still be hatin'
[06:34] <Somnia> who mike brown?
[06:34] <WasabiKing> besides having lebron on his team
[06:34] <Shinobi_F1> haha
[06:34] <jman2050> Cleveland is so bad that they let Atlanta win a championship
[06:34] <jman2050> Atlanta

[06:34] <Shinobi_F1> LOL!

[06:34] <Shinobi_F1> yeah wtf
[06:34] <GaimeGuy> Wii sports resort sounds like an awesome deal
[06:34] <WasabiKing> and Florida
[06:34] <WasabiKing> don't forget Florida
[06:34] <Shinobi_F1> cleveland's so bad they let the broncos beat their ass in back to back seasons with the same goddamn two minute drive
[06:34] <jman2050> seriously, I maintain that the onyl reason Atlanta even has a championship is because they managed to face a team that's even more cursed than them
[06:35] <Shinobi_F1> I agree
[06:35] <Shinobi_F1> lulz @ the braves
[06:35] <TToB> Shinobi_F1: If Jordan or Johnson played in Cleveland I imagine it would be the same. One man trying to prop up a loser team. :p
[06:35] <Shinobi_F1> something like, 30 straight division titles

[07:20] <jman2050> lol
[07:21] <jman2050> "Overall I am not troubled by this loss. usually after a "tough loss" I have that sinking feeling in my stomach, that moment of doubt. Tonight... I don't have that feeling at all. As a matter of fact I wouldn't even categorize this as a "tough" loss. More of an annoying one than anything."

[07:44] <GaimeGuy> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=16235587&postcount=43  wat
[07:45] <bluemax> mariners havent drafted a single pitcher
[07:45] <bluemax> hmm
[07:46] <jman2050> bluemax: they noticed they have too many relievers
[07:46] <jman2050> so they went for hitters instead
[07:46] <bluemax> har har
[07:46] <bluemax> they got the best college hitter in the draft
[07:46] <bluemax> and the best college power hitter
[07:46] <bluemax> so i guess thats not bad
[07:46] <Kab_Laptop> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=16244020&postcount=60 < lol
[07:47] <jman2050> I got a kick out of that strike zone plot LL did with Beltre, Johjima and company
[07:47] <jman2050> compared to everyone else

[07:52] <FirewalkR> indeed
[07:52] <FirewalkR> only drunken bastards care

[07:54] <EGM92> booze it was orin.
[07:54] <avcables> i'll weed them out
[07:54] <FirewalkR> WasabiKing.. regarding the channel... I found it by myself quite a while ago :)
[07:54] <WasabiKing> no it's not, orin don't bother
[07:54] <WasabiKing> he's too busy

[07:54] <WasabiKing> seriously D-FENCE
[07:54] <WasabiKing> we've already reached our ntard quota
[07:55] <EGM92> she has little to no ass.
[07:55] <EGM92> fail BJ
[07:55] <jman2050> Do I count as .5 ntard or .25 ntard?
[07:55] <bluemax> she looks like a boy bj
[07:55] <bluemax> sorry
[07:57] <BJ43> enough to give bonars </tmi>
[07:58] <EviLore> shit, tre recommended me stuff that's on Pitchfork top 10 lists
[07:59] <bluemax> tre is trendy confirmed
[07:59] <FirewalkR> oh man... i just saw GI's Max Payne 3 cover.... hmmm.... http://i40.tinypic.com/11slfys.jpg ... hmmm.... i don't know what to think about it.
[07:59] <FirewalkR> well, the artwork is Rockstar's alright
[07:59] <BJ43> is max payne dying from fox die
[08:00] <Kab_Laptop> Seems more like Sam Fisher
[08:00] <thesoapster> lol
[08:00] <FirewalkR> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=364724 <--- post 55 got it right, both in content AND the poster's avatar
[08:00] <thesoapster> that looks nothing like max payne...
[08:00] <Kab_Laptop> Or Jeff Bridges in Iron Man!
[08:00] * pj has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[08:00] <Kab_Laptop> It's definitely Jeff Bridges in Iron Man
[08:01] <FirewalkR> Kab_Laptop (check post 55 in that thread)
[08:01] <Kab_Laptop> YES!
[08:01] <EviLore> well, max payne looked nothing like max payne in max payne 2 either.  but that's besides the point, since this shit isn't being made by remedy and is gonna suck
[08:01] <FirewalkR> i really really hope Alan Wake is good
[08:02] <thesoapster> alan wake is still coming out?
[08:02] <avcables> alan wake looks awesome
[08:02] <avcables> fuck the haters
[08:02] <FirewalkR> of course
[08:02] <Kab_Laptop> They demo'd Alan Wake at the MS conference
[08:02] <FirewalkR> was just shown at MS's conference
[08:02] <EviLore> alan wake shooting seemed questionable
[08:02] <EviLore> which is odd
[08:02] <FirewalkR> I'll have it for PC though
[08:02] <avcables> what part about it, evilore?
[08:02] <avcables> the shooting mechanic itself?
[08:02] <Unison> the fact that there was so much shooting seemed questionable imo
[08:02] <thesoapster> 2nd quarter 2010
[08:02] <Unison> haha
[08:02] <thesoapster> LOL
[08:02] <Kab_Laptop> It being a prettier version of EVERY FUCKING SURVIVAL HORROR GAME EVER MADE seemed questionable
[08:02] <WasabiKing> lol
[08:02] <avcables> or the whole flashlight on the enemies and then pop them with some bulllets
[08:03] <WasabiKing> kimmel is about to lose another 10K in blackjack
[08:03] <jakehk_suicidewatch> live?
[08:03] <FirewalkR> Alan Wake's demo didn't do much for me... but I'm trusting Remedy
[08:03] <WasabiKing> tape delay
[08:03] <WasabiKing> but it was live
[08:03] <WasabiKing> lol
[08:03] <avcables> i like how it's chapters of a book or whatever they said
[08:03] <WasabiKing> he's making fat bank
[08:03] <WasabiKing> lost $20K
[08:03] <WasabiKing> lolol
[08:03] <WasabiKing> awesome
[08:03] <WasabiKing> oh shit
[08:03] <WasabiKing> another 10K
[08:04] <WasabiKing> haha
[08:04] <Tre`> FirewalkR:  FLARES man
[08:04] <Tre`> slow motion
[08:04] <Tre`> fucking shit up with a flare
[08:04] <avcables> yea seriously
[08:04] <avcables> that flare shit
[08:04] <avcables> was tits
[08:04] <WasabiKing> lol
[08:04] <WasabiKing> $30K down
[08:04] <WasabiKing> over
[08:05] <bluemax> alan wake looked lame
[08:05] <bluemax> 3 years for a silent hill clone?
[08:05] <WasabiKing> they were going to bet, and if they won 3 times in a row
[08:05] <bluemax> pass
[08:05] <FirewalkR> Tre`: Death Rally :D
[08:05] <WasabiKing> the money would ahve been split with the entire studio audience
[08:05] <WasabiKing> which would ahve been a minimum of $80K
[08:05] <jakehk_suicidewatch> smh
[08:05] <jakehk_suicidewatch> rigged
[08:05] <WasabiKing> cause if they hit black jack
[08:05] <Kab_Laptop> (7:06:13) FirewalkR: Tre`: Death Rally :D < Greatest Remedy game ever.
[08:05] <WasabiKing> it would have been more money
[08:05] <WasabiKing> lol
[08:06] <Kab_Laptop> I loooove Death Rally
[08:06] <Kab_Laptop> That game kicks ass
[08:06] <FirewalkR> and last but not least.. some of the guys there are ex-Future Crew
[08:06] <FirewalkR> that's gotta count for something
[08:07] <Kab_Laptop> They gotta make a new Death Rally
[08:07] * thesoapster has quit IRC (Quit: thesoapster)
[08:07] <FirewalkR> hmmm... i'd rather look at it with my rose-tinted glasses i guess...
[08:07] <FirewalkR> they'd probably spoil it nowadays
[08:08] <FirewalkR> it's kinda like watching the sensible soccer dudes trying to make a modern version
[08:10] <FirewalkR> swos or kick off 2 on the Amiga are still the best footie games ever for me. i don't think they'd translate well...
[08:10] <FirewalkR> speedball 2 is another good example.
[08:11] <BJ43> uh oh tying run up for the padres

[08:22] <FirewalkR> ummmm.... how's the 3drealms situation? they're gone or what?
[08:24] <FirewalkR> lol -> http://i42.tinypic.com/2e3a4nq.jpg
[08:24] <HadesGigas> the company exists
[08:24] <HadesGigas> most of the people were canned though
[08:25] <GaimeGuy> http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v347/skapunkguy/whoshotya.jpg   scary
[08:25] <FirewalkR> nukem's gone forever? (pun unintended :P)
[08:25] <HadesGigas> no
[08:25] * GaimeGuy punts FirewalkR across the street
[08:25] <GaimeGuy> don't follow me
[08:26] <HadesGigas> Apogee Software (a different company started by one of the 3DRealms founders, 3DR used to be named Apogee also) still exists and will be making Duke Nukem games for DS/PSP
[08:26] <FirewalkR> i remember the apogee name very well... the shareware games of trh
[08:26] <FirewalkR> of that era... when epic was epic megagames...
[08:27] <FirewalkR> lots of good stuff. good times
[08:27] <FirewalkR> i suddenly recalled zone 66
[08:27] * priz has joined #GA
[08:27] <HadesGigas> Basically 3D Realms exists now as a company that will liscense out the Duke Nukem IP, like it is doing for Apogee
[08:27] <FirewalkR> i think i only played the shareware version
[08:27] <priz> http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090610/ap_on_re_us/us_nc_building_collapse
[08:27] <DrForester> oh snap
[08:28] <priz> ...into a slim jim?
[08:28] <DrForester> bah, people died
[08:28] <DrForester> no jokes, nvm
[08:28] <priz> yeah
[08:28] <priz> it's really messed up
[08:28] <GaimeGuy> I find it kind of hilarious that there was a giant ammonia cloud from the slim jim plant
[08:29] <FirewalkR> HadesGigas, any chance of someone using DNF's existing assets to complete the game?
[08:30] <priz> "I was getting ready to pick up a piece of meat off the line and I felt it — the percussion. And you could feel it in my chest and my ears popped," said worker Chris Woods. "One of the guys I was working with got blown back — his hat flew backwards."
[08:30] <priz> that's just crazy
[08:30] <HadesGigas> Take Two is currently claiming they own the publishing rights to Duke Nukem Forever and are suing 3DR for breach of contract for not finishing it
[08:31] <GaimeGuy> what the fuck are they going to compensate you with?
[08:31] <GaimeGuy> they're bankrupt
[08:31] <GaimeGuy> lol

[08:33] <HadesGigas> I believe they said that 3DR needed more funding to be able to finish the game, but Take Two thought that was ridiculous and would do so only if they got the rights to the Duke IP
[08:33] <FirewalkR> well... after a decade Take Two is probably entitled to feel it is ridiculous :)
[08:34] <GaimeGuy> ah yes, the MiniScribe scandal
[08:34] <HadesGigas> Yeah I don't remember the figure they wanted
[08:34] <HadesGigas> it was in the millions
[08:34] <HadesGigas> and Take Two was like "ok, here's way more than that, just sell us Duke"
[08:34] <FirewalkR> apogee/3drealms... it still surprises me... they were so good. they had that guy, ken silverman i think, he was this awesome engine programmer
[08:35] <FirewalkR> and they had some great games
[08:35] <HadesGigas> which is not really a move they'd probably go for, considering the only money 3DR was making was in sales of their old games like Duke on XBLA and things like taht
[08:35] <HadesGigas> other than the money Take Two was handing them every now and then...
[08:36] <BJ43> I bought Wacky Wheels five years ago
[08:36] <GaimeGuy> http://advsys.net/ken/
[08:36] <BJ43> That's lunch for someone
[08:38] <GaimeGuy> you can download the engine source code :)
[08:38] <FirewalkR> Gaime, I saw his site a while ago... but i still don't get what he's up to lol. A long time ago John Carmack said he really respected this guy
[08:39] <GaimeGuy> email him!
[08:39] <BJ43> I was watching the Yanks/Sox earlier and someone said something about "the engine driving the offense" and I had to see if they were talking about Jacoby Ellsbury
[08:39] <FirewalkR> I think someone had asked JC if there was anyone he thought of as his "rival"
[08:39] * Danj is now known as Danj_work
[08:39] <GaimeGuy> do it
[08:43] <FirewalkR> gaime... dunno... looking at his site i can only think of "wasted potential" :/

[08:58] <happy_phantom> well, I'm trying to play prototype and I barely have anything on my ps3 that I know of, and now I'm being told I don't have the required space for it to play
[08:59] <mrsolo> you gotta be kidding me
[09:00] <happy_phantom> I admit that I know very little about the ps3. I bought it as a littlebigplanet machine and that's about it
[09:00] <Tony_Parker> Tribune reporter Tim Floyd resigned from Southern California on Tuesday
[09:01] <mrsolo> well
[09:01] <happy_phantom> how do I check what's taking up space on it anyways?
[09:01] <happy_phantom> I can't seem to navigate to it
[09:01] <mrsolo> well what do you have on it?
[09:01] <mrsolo> video? music? anything?
[09:01] <mrsolo> demo?
[09:02] <happy_phantom> off hand, I know of my sf4 install, 500MBs of music and 3 PSN games
[09:02] <mrsolo> what's the space requirement for prototype?
[09:03] <happy_phantom> 650 MB
[09:03] <happy_phantom> so I'm trying to figure out what's tkaing up this space
[09:03] <mrsolo> how much do you have left?
[09:04] <Unison> delete that GTHD crap if you have it
[09:04] <happy_phantom> wait, wtf
[09:04] <happy_phantom> I just checked
[09:04] <happy_phantom> and it says I have 20 GB free... but when I tried to play prototype it said I didn't have enough space
[09:05] <mrsolo> bug heh
[09:05] <Somnia> delete something and then try
[09:05] <minty> it's a sign
[09:05] <Somnia> it was something that happened to ratchet also
[09:05] <minty> your ps3 be telling you not to play the game
[09:05] <happy_phantom> but it was a free rental and I'm broke =(
[09:05] <happy_phantom> I need to play it ;p
[09:06] <Somnia> do what I said
[09:06] <happy_phantom> I am
[09:06] <minty> delete sf4
[09:06] <minty> it's crap anyway
[09:06] <happy_phantom> noooooooooooo

[09:07] <happy_phantom> There is not enough avilable space in the HDD. (PROTOTYPE)tm require at least 649MB of free space. Press the PS button to return to the XMBtm screen. You can restart the game after freeing 649 MB from the HDD.
[09:07] <happy_phantom> stupid game
[09:07] <happy_phantom> and that was after deleting some stuff

[09:11] <mrsolo> haha
[09:11] <mrsolo> known issue
[09:11] <Tony_Parker> never gets fixed
[09:11] <Somnia> you know the meteor strike on NYC in armaggeddon looks like transformers coming down to earth...like a lot like it =P
[09:11] <Tony_Parker> take it back
[09:11] <Tony_Parker> buy ufc
[09:12] <Tony_Parker> for dreamcast*
[09:12] <Tony_Parker> lol
[09:12] <happy_phantom> I already have UFC for the cast
[09:13] <happy_phantom> =(
[09:13] <Tony_Parker> I just won 10 seconds into the 1st round
[09:13] <happy_phantom> fuck this shit
[09:13] <happy_phantom> if I actually was interested in this game, I'd be outraged
[09:14] <Tony_Parker> fight of the night XD

[09:21] <happy_phantom> well
[09:21] <happy_phantom> after deleting some other stuff
[09:21] * warcock-tf2 has joined #GA
[09:21] <happy_phantom> I deleted my demo of inFAMOUS... and now it's actually working... coincidence that it only works when inFAMOUS is removed? 
[09:22] <warcock-tf2> infamous uses too much of the ps power
[09:22] <warcock-tf2> !
[09:23] <Tre`> your PS3 can only handle one mediocre open world action game at a time
[09:23] * KimiSleepHonestly is now known as KimiNewt
[09:24] <warcock-tf2>   MAG (PS3) - 256 player online battle love #1
[09:24] <warcock-tf2> whoa, that's a lot of players....
[09:24] <warcock-tf2> -256 Players
[09:24] <warcock-tf2> -8 Player Squads
[09:24] <warcock-tf2> cool concept!
[09:24] <warcock-tf2> terrible platform!
[09:24] <KimiNewt> you've just now heard of it?
[09:24] <KimiNewt> tiduz'd
[09:24] <warcock-tf2> owned
[09:25] <Firestorm> what
[09:25] <EviLore> MAG is pretty zzz
[09:25] <warcock-tf2> i take pride in my relative ignorance of the gaming scene, i can therefore use it in a fallacious way to act like a pretentious dick around here
[09:26] <warcock-tf2> its like bf2 
[09:26] <warcock-tf2> with  more people
[09:26] <warcock-tf2> on ps3
[09:26] <warcock-tf2> bleh
[09:26] <Firestorm> MAG looks interesting to me. Then I remind myself that 256 players on a PS3 online game will never work ever due to the type of people who play consoles
[09:26] <warcock-tf2> and 30 fps
[09:26] <EviLore> have you watched the gameplay vids, war?
[09:26] <KimiNewt> Yeah, that seems interesting to me
[09:26] <EviLore> it's not very interesting
[09:26] <warcock-tf2> evilore: about 20 secs
[09:26] <Firestorm> I would love to take part in a 128v128 game of people working together
[09:26] <KimiNewt> If it ever gets on PC I'll play it
[09:26] <Firestorm> but lol.
[09:26] <warcock-tf2> yeah very average
[09:26] <KimiNewt> Who's it by?
[09:26] <KimiNewt> I mean is it inhouse?
[09:26] <EviLore> zipper
[09:26] <Firestorm> SOCOM guys
[09:26] <KimiNewt> Oh
[09:26] <KimiNewt> Rightrightright
[09:26] <warcock-tf2> that should kinda tell you how its going to turn out
[09:26] <KimiNewt> But surely if this works someone will make a PC game with that many players
[09:27] <Tre`> people have already made FPSs with lots of players
[09:27] <warcock-tf2> socom isnt TERRIBLE, its just well mediocre
[09:27] <Tre`> Tribes, Delta Force, etc.
[09:27] <KimiNewt> this many?
[09:27] <warcock-tf2> PLANETSIDEEe
[09:27] <warcock-tf2> a general rule of thumb 
[09:27] <KimiNewt> and that isn't that sorta game though
[09:27] <Tre`> I think delta force could do upwards of 256
[09:27] <warcock-tf2> the more players you have, the shittier the game
[09:27] <warcock-tf2> only technology can fix this
[09:27] <warcock-tf2> and its not there yet
[09:28] <Tre`> it's pretty tough to design a map around 256 players that is fun
[09:28] <warcock-tf2> unless you do like 256 with cs 1.6 grfx
[09:28] <Tre`> but that depends on the game and the mechanics, I guess
[09:28] <warcock-tf2> meh fun, in the quick gratification
[09:28] <KimiNewt> which is pretty much what MAG is doing
[09:28] <KimiNewt> amirite
[09:28] <Tre`> no
[09:28] <warcock-tf2> that you are use to with fps now
[09:28] <warcock-tf2> but like big ass strategic games = different ball games
[09:28] <warcock-tf2> RS kind of hotness
[09:28] <Firestorm> How many players was Battlefield 2?
[09:29] <Tre`> 64
[09:29] <KimiNewt> 64
[09:29] <warcock-tf2> 64
[09:29] <Firestorm> When that came out I was on a geforce 5200 fx
[09:29] <Firestorm> :(
[09:29] <KimiNewt> and that worked wel
[09:29] <warcock-tf2> tre this one is for u my luver
[09:29] <Firestorm> 32 vs 32 eh...
[09:29] <warcock-tf2> mav: scrim
[09:29] <warcock-tf2> warcack: i quit cs
[09:29] <KimiNewt> except for the times your commander was striking your own base
[09:29] <Firestorm> sounds hard enough to coordinate there
[09:29] <KimiNewt> You've squads in BF2 as well
[09:29] <warcock-tf2> thats why you play with people you know
[09:29] <Tre`> yeah, delta force had upwards of 200
[09:30] <warcock-tf2> fools
[09:30] <Tre`> war:  lol
[09:30] <KimiNewt> yeah but you don't have 64 people you know playing at the same time
[09:30] <KimiNewt> you just find a server you know
[09:30] <KimiNewt> well 64
[09:30] <KimiNewt> 63
[09:30] <warcock-tf2> discussing strategy is fun
[09:30] <warcock-tf2> we should all go in an isketch room
[09:30] <Tre`> that's not really going to change with MAG, kimi
[09:30] <warcock-tf2> and discuss what to do pre game
[09:30] <KimiNewt> Not saying it is
[09:30] <warcock-tf2> i could draw a penis to make rushing analogies
[09:30] <Tre`> also, Battlefield with 64 players is kinda shitty
[09:30] <KimiNewt> That's probably gonna be the biggest problem for any game
[09:30] <Tre`> 32-48, max.
[09:30] <Firestorm> [23:29:49] [warcock-tf2] thats why you play with people you know
[09:30] <Firestorm> 64 people you know is hard
[09:31] <warcock-tf2> cuz your an introverted nurddd
[09:31] <bluemaxmini> not with neogaf!
[09:31] <Firestorm> it's hard enough getting a game of tf2 going with my friends these days :(
[09:31] <warcock-tf2> no i understand this firestorm
[09:31] <KimiNewt> you're
[09:31] <KimiNewt> well
[09:31] <KimiNewt> maybe if you played earlier than 3am firestorm
[09:31] <warcock-tf2> firestorm: nobody gives a fuck on neogaf now, but when it came out
[09:31] <Firestorm> you live in crazy time zones kimi
[09:31] <Firestorm> not my fault
[09:31] <warcock-tf2> we had big scrims
[09:31] <KimiNewt> No, you are
[09:31] <Firestorm> well bf2 always seemed fun to me
[09:31] <KimiNewt> GMT - fucking eight or whatever, that's batshit insnae
[09:32] <Firestorm> i like those games where i play one supportive role that helps the team
[09:32] <warcock-tf2> i think like if you get people involved
[09:32] <warcock-tf2> outside of just playing the game
[09:32] <Firestorm> my top 3 classes in tf2 are the support ones >_>
[09:32] <warcock-tf2> with a really nice thread
[09:32] <warcock-tf2> discussing stuff
[09:32] <warcock-tf2> you can hold on to their intention for awhile
[09:32] <warcock-tf2> we need to insert some sort of prize
[09:32] <warcock-tf2> like one team fights for gaimeguy's account survival
[09:32] <warcock-tf2> and the other to get him banned
[09:33] <KimiNewt> hey my screen is here
[09:33] <KimiNewt> they said it'll take two weeks
[09:33] <KimiNewt> it took two days
[09:33] <KimiNewt> I'm gonna send a complaint letter
[09:33] <KimiNewt> hahaha
[09:33] <warcock-tf2> make sure you let them know you are 15
[09:33] <KimiNewt> I'm 16 dear
[09:34] <warcock-tf2> so your legal
[09:34] <warcock-tf2> :D!
[09:34] <KimiNewt> you're
[09:34] <KimiNewt> and yes
[09:34] <KimiNewt> and it's alright, I have an ID and everything
[09:34] <KimiNewt> Student card, just missing a bloody license
[09:34] <KimiNewt> which I will get in bloody november
[09:34] <Firestorm> can we have a tf2 tournament with banning of gaimeguy up for grabs
[09:34] <warcock-tf2> lawl
[09:34] <warcock-tf2> but dude
[09:34] <warcock-tf2> tf2 is moot 
[09:34] <warcock-tf2> lol
[09:34] <KimiNewt> not it's not
[09:34] <warcock-tf2> there isnt that much strat involved
[09:35] <KimiNewt> There totally is
[09:35] <warcock-tf2> you cant spend hours analyzing a course of action
[09:35] <Firestorm> there's enough to be fun
[09:35] <KimiNewt> If you work together
[09:35] <warcock-tf2> ehhhhhhhhhhhhh
[09:35] <warcock-tf2> i dont believe its complex enough
[09:35] <Firestorm> you don't want to have a game where you spend cs levels of analyzing on gaf
[09:35] <Firestorm> not enough people will go into that
[09:35] <Firestorm> so you'd be bored
[09:35] <KimiNewt> versus just a bunch of random people the difference is huge
[09:35] <warcock-tf2> firestrom: see i disagree
[09:35] <Firestorm> but gaf games where people are coordinating are good fun
[09:35] <warcock-tf2> if you can find a niche group of people that take it fairly seriously
[09:35] <warcock-tf2> it can be really fun
[09:35] <Firestorm> oh no no no
[09:35] <Firestorm> I totally agree
[09:35] <warcock-tf2> not pro status or anything
[09:35] <Firestorm> I'm saying GAF isn't like that
[09:35] <warcock-tf2> like have an isketch chat
[09:36] <Firestorm> so you wouldn't get that anyway
[09:36] <warcock-tf2> to draw map and strat mockups
[09:36] <warcock-tf2> and draw penises to break the ice
[09:36] <warcock-tf2> it would be kewl
[09:36] <KimiNewt> I dunno, back at the height of the popularity we had some fun teamwork shit going on
[09:36] <warcock-tf2> like if you can get some activity outside the game 
[09:36] <warcock-tf2> towards the gaming experience
[09:36] <warcock-tf2> the experience will be exponentially funner
[09:36] <warcock-tf2> but like asking people to meet up at X time
[09:36] <warcock-tf2> is just like playing in a pub
[09:36] <warcock-tf2> its like meh
[09:36] <warcock-tf2> oh yes i got to kill tre
[09:37] <warcock-tf2> e-peen + 1 i get to bust his chops in chat
[09:37] <warcock-tf2> but nobody really cares
[09:37] <warcock-tf2> etc
[09:37] * bluemaxmini has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[09:37] <KimiNewt> It's fun?
[09:37] <warcock-tf2> shut up kimi
[09:37] <KimiNewt> anyway gotta go downstairs so I'll hear them knock; laters
[09:37] <warcock-tf2> initially we had something decent going on neogaf with tf2
[09:37] <Firestorm> we had chats and shit going for the last gaf tournament
[09:37] <warcock-tf2> like there were 2 rival teams
[09:37] <warcock-tf2> and it was fairly heated
[09:37] <Firestorm> each team was doing group chats
[09:38] <Firestorm> aww i missed that :( that'd be awesome
[09:38] <KimiNewt> I was in uh
[09:38] <KimiNewt> Fuck I forgot
[09:38] <warcock-tf2> i forgot
[09:38] <KimiNewt> I was with richardfan
[09:38] <warcock-tf2> i think i was GAF
[09:38] <warcock-tf2> the other was OBMA
[09:38] <warcock-tf2> right?
[09:38] <warcock-tf2> no?
[09:38] <warcock-tf2> i remember that swedish cunt annoyed me with his lag compensation
[09:38] <warcock-tf2> megh
[09:39] <warcock-tf2> ghost deaths
[09:39] <Firestorm> OBMA HLRY
[09:40] <Firestorm> that's the tournament that failed
[09:40] <Firestorm> there was also one with three teams or something
[09:40] <Firestorm> I was on Java's team iirc
[09:40] <KimiNewt> I think I was too, with you then
[09:40] <happy_phantom> might return this rental tomorrow =\
[09:41] <warcock-tf2> the thing though
[09:41] <warcock-tf2> like all it requires is some time investment though
[09:41] <warcock-tf2> and most forumites dont have that to spare, since they game every console etc
[09:41] <happy_phantom> I'll play some more and all
[09:41] <Firestorm> Like me :(
[09:41] <jakehk_suicidewatch> shut up
[09:41] <warcock-tf2> or busy with other stuff etc
[09:42] <Firestorm> I'm really interested in competitive gaming
[09:42] <happy_phantom> but I'm not digging this at all
[09:42] <Firestorm> but I don't have the skills or time
[09:42] <Firestorm> I basically gave up on smash
[09:42] <warcock-tf2> firestorm: eh its BS
[09:42] <warcock-tf2> its a waste of time
[09:42] <Firestorm> because i figured i would rather play a variety of games than one at this point
[09:42] <warcock-tf2> with no endgame reward
[09:42] <Firestorm> not to mention the smash community is pretty shitty
[09:42] <Firestorm> well tournaments and stuff are fun
[09:42] <warcock-tf2> other then a bunch of meaningless people adoring you
[09:42] <Firestorm> I just ran them for the last little while
[09:42] <Firestorm> instea dof actually playing
[09:43] <warcock-tf2> its incredibly stressful too
[09:43] <warcock-tf2> fuck
[09:43] <warcock-tf2> the best fighthing game player works as a clerk
[09:43] <warcock-tf2> in an arcade
[09:43] <WasabiKing> what tourists are going to mexico right now
[09:43] <warcock-tf2> lets up the ante
[09:43] * Shinobi_F1 has joined #GA
[09:43] <bluemax> jews
[09:43] <Firestorm> mexicans
[09:43] <warcock-tf2> the best CS players like probably netted around 50-60 k a year when cs was at its prime
[09:44] * Bob_Coffee has joined #GA
[09:44] <warcock-tf2> and korean starcraft players make money but are mutants
[09:44] <warcock-tf2> i.e. not ordinary humans
[09:44] <KimiNewt> screen's here
[09:44] <KimiNewt> man starcraft in korea
[09:44] <KimiNewt> shit seems cool
[09:44] <warcock-tf2> no it dosent
[09:45] <warcock-tf2> these kids have SC forced down their throats since they were children
[09:45] <warcock-tf2> and are incredible amount of pressure
[09:45] <warcock-tf2> under*
[09:45] <KimiNewt> isn't that with most pro sports
[09:45] <warcock-tf2> CHILD LABOR
[09:45] <warcock-tf2> i.e its not a sport
[09:46] <warcock-tf2> and pro sports rewards you with women/riches/fame/respect
[09:46] <bluemax> warcock-tf2>	these kids have SC forced down their throats since they were children
[09:46] <warcock-tf2> its um a mental endeavor if anything, kind of like chess
[09:46] <bluemax> and pro athletes dont have sports shoved on them?
[09:47] <KimiNewt> hmm
[09:47] <warcock-tf2> yes but pro atheletes have like the promise of prosperity
[09:47] <KimiNewt> will I dual monitor
[09:47] <KimiNewt> who knows
[09:47] <warcock-tf2> if they reach the end game
[09:47] <warcock-tf2> on top of being the best at what you do
[09:47] <warcock-tf2> if that whats drives you
[09:48] <KimiNewt> I'll have to change my whole desk layout
[09:48] <KimiNewt> and I'll have to move my periodic table
[09:48] <warcock-tf2> also like only the top of the top get any kind of recognition
[09:48] <warcock-tf2> in progaming
[09:48] <warcock-tf2> extremely low probabilities of success
[09:48] <KimiNewt> that's the same in other lesser popular sports
[09:48] <warcock-tf2> not really
[09:49] <warcock-tf2> your some nobody in the nba
[09:49] <warcock-tf2> you are still an nba player
[09:49] <warcock-tf2> and you make jizz
[09:49] <warcock-tf2> or did you mean like triathlon
[09:49] <warcock-tf2> or some shit
[09:49] <KimiNewt> yeah shit like that
[09:49] <warcock-tf2> ehhhhhhh
[09:49] <KimiNewt> even something as popular as tennis
[09:49] <warcock-tf2> no
[09:49] <KimiNewt> (at least here)
[09:50] <warcock-tf2> tennis is pretty big
[09:50] <KimiNewt> people here don't know the names of more than the top ~5
[09:50] <warcock-tf2> here too
[09:50] <warcock-tf2> but professionals make cash eitherway
[09:50] <KimiNewt> though it's getting more popular
[09:50] <warcock-tf2> and appeal to the tennis circles
[09:50] <warcock-tf2> its pretty cool in elite circles
[09:51] <warcock-tf2> " I R TENNIS PLAYER"
[09:51] <warcock-tf2> anyways moral of the story is that pro gaming sucks
[09:51] <warcock-tf2> balls
[09:51] * Shinobi_F1 has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[09:51] <WasabiKing> the difference is that pro gaming relies on sponsorships
[09:52] <warcock-tf2> yeah but the sponsors dont invest shit
[09:52] <WasabiKing> and that goes to SHIT during bad economies
[09:52] <warcock-tf2> omg intel
[09:52] <warcock-tf2> even when the economy was ok
[09:52] <WasabiKing> they might supply rigs and shit
[09:52] <WasabiKing> but not actual cash
[09:52] <warcock-tf2> the biggest american pro gaming tourney
[09:52] <WasabiKing> pro sports has TV deals
[09:52] <WasabiKing> people attending
[09:52] <warcock-tf2> with gazillions of people watching it around the world
[09:52] <WasabiKing> merch sales
[09:52] <warcock-tf2> and paying attention to it
[09:52] <warcock-tf2> intel had a combined pool of 100k
[09:52] <warcock-tf2> big woop!
[09:52] <warcock-tf2> cpl*
[09:53] <WasabiKing> that's on the people organizing that shit
[09:53] <warcock-tf2> FOR ALL THE GAMES
[09:53] <warcock-tf2> no but dude i mean from a marketing stand point
[09:53] <warcock-tf2> you cant convince intel to pool millions
[09:53] <WasabiKing> there's no incentive
[09:53] <warcock-tf2> it is just pro gaming
[09:53] <WasabiKing> what the fuck for
[09:53] <KimiNewt> um
[09:53] <KimiNewt> are monitors these days supposed to not come with an AC cable?
[09:53] <warcock-tf2> well fundementally you are catering to a potential customer base
[09:53] <WasabiKing> I bet it's all tradeout anyway
[09:54] <warcock-tf2> but im not sure whehter you need to convince them of anything
[09:54] <WasabiKing> they let them build rigs
[09:54] <warcock-tf2> they follow that shit on their own
[09:54] <WasabiKing> put their stickers everywhere
[09:54] <warcock-tf2> i.e TOMS HARDWARE
[09:54] <WasabiKing> the audience puts in no money
[09:54] <warcock-tf2> pretty mucb
[09:55] <warcock-tf2> only the competitors pool in, bu tis minor iirc
[09:55] <WasabiKing> there's no real draw
[09:55] <WasabiKing> you can say millions watch
[09:55] <WasabiKing> but who cares, they pay nothing
[09:55] <WasabiKing> if there was a PPV charge, like 1% would pay
[09:55] <warcock-tf2> well yeah and i agree
[09:55] <KimiNewt> yeah there's no AC cable, I have some but what the shit
[09:56] <WasabiKing> there's no money to be made
[09:56] <warcock-tf2> nobody gives a shit
[09:56] <warcock-tf2> no matter how many people follow it
[09:56] <WasabiKing> honestly, the best is the sponsored people
[09:56] <WasabiKing> why fucking bother
[09:56] <warcock-tf2> well its marketing people trying to make face to their bosses
[09:56] <WasabiKing> all those people should be fired
[09:56] <WasabiKing> lol
[09:56] <warcock-tf2> save*
[09:56] <WasabiKing> paying some dude to play games
[09:57] <WasabiKing> with your shit
[09:57] <Armitage> THE WAY ITS MEANT TO BE PLAYEDDDD
[09:57] <warcock-tf2> well the assumption i guess is this
[09:57] <WasabiKing> how delusional
[09:57] <warcock-tf2> I WON BECAUSE I USED AN MX870
[09:57] <Firestorm> there was decent money in MLG for thsoe who did it on the side and were good
[09:57] <WasabiKing> I mean, same can sorta be said with Jordans and shit
[09:57] <warcock-tf2> YOU THEREFORE NEED TO GET AN MX870 AMATEUR GAMER
[09:57] <warcock-tf2> but we saw how well fatality's line of products is down
[09:57] <warcock-tf2> F
[09:57] <Firestorm> maybe because it seemed like his products were overpriced shit.
[09:58] <warcock-tf2> FATALLY!
[09:58] <warcock-tf2> HAHAHA1
[09:58] <warcock-tf2> 1111'
[09:58] <WasabiKing> lol

[07:48] <bluemaxmini> man the more i hear them talk about tony hawk ride
[07:48] <bluemaxmini> the worse it sounds
[07:49] <Grecco> It looks like a crappy way to play Top Skater essentially
[07:49] <bluemaxmini> it looks like tony hawk down hill jam
[07:50] <bluemaxmini> with a peripheral
[07:50] <jakehk_suicidewatch> top skater is awesome
[07:53] <ghst> i was just playing darkest hour, the red orchestra mod

[08:14] <TEEEPO> i did have it for dod though
[08:14] <bjork-wtf> a tag = notoriety to some people
[08:14] <bjork-wtf> it's way more fun when it's something taken out of context though imo
[08:14] <TEEEPO> but i concur with it making games feel more tight and intense

[08:34] <EviLore> prolly not
[08:35] <GaimeGuy> booo

[08:37] <EviLore> went over this before when I was reading vinland saga, but basically I'll only read manga for exceptional art, generally.  manga translation available on the internet is 99% awful, and unlike subbed anime I don't have the japanese dialgue there in the background to give further context and deemphasize the care taken with the english script.  So basically I end up thinking the "writing" is awful in most manga without that there.

[08:38] * Danj is now known as Danj_work
[08:38] * GaimeGuy can't wait for episode 14
[08:39] <EviLore> I also don't like how action in handled in most manga, especially weekly stuff
[08:39] <EviLore> so I end up having absolutely no reason to read something like FMA rather than watching the anime, if a full adaptation is being made
[08:39] * Grecco has quit IRC (Quit: )
[08:40] <EviLore> the only way to partially address this would be to buy licensed manga.  for $10 volumes that I would read in like 10 minutes
[08:40] <GaimeGuy> it's not exactly full. :(
[08:41] <EviLore> so for manga I pretty much stick to the stuff with exceptional art
[08:42] <GaimeGuy> they've left out some awesome banter and comedy involving Ed + Mustang , and they skipped marcoh's encounter with Lust in his home for some reason
[08:43] <Unison> japs lol
[08:43] <Unison> in this movie, this wife is sexually frustrated, so she is whipping her limbless, mute war veteran husband
[08:43] <Unison> haha

[08:45] <EviLore> losing patience somewhat, but I'll keep watching episode to episode for now

[10:50] <Nikashi> No you don't or you wouldn't have known it was an anime lol
[10:50] <Mandoric> if we all stand in a circle, clap, and say "congratulations", will you understand.
[10:52] <Mandoric> anyway uh.
[10:52] <Propagandhim> i honesty guessed..i can't believe i was right
[10:52] <Propagandhim> it's an anime
[10:52] <Mandoric> http://www.translation-is.srsfkn.biz/?p=26 i think i need less spare time.
[10:52] <Propagandhim> anything with "eden" in the title is anime
[10:52] <Propagandhim> the japanese are predictable
[10:53] <Nikashi> I'm only really closely following Ippo right now
[10:56] <Propagandhim> i follow dragon ball z
[10:56] <Propagandhim> that's the only anime that makes sense
[10:58] <Propagandhim> hadokens and shit
[10:58] <Propagandhim> you know what i mean
[10:58] <BudokaiMR2> MANDORIC
[10:58] <BudokaiMR2> i have been watching it
[10:58] <BudokaiMR2> up to 8 i think
[10:59] <Mandoric> check out that link and uh I guess the other stuff on the blog but it's all ep 9 spoilers, it's a bunch of itnteresting stuff i found.
[11:00] <BudokaiMR2> yeah im reading it now
[11:01] <BudokaiMR2> wow you know a lot more about japanese history than me ;p
[11:01] <Propagandhim> can we talk about something interesting now?
[11:01] <Propagandhim> something that isn't about Japanese animation?  PLEASE.
[11:01] <Propagandhim> lets talk about something AMERICAN.
[11:01] <Propagandhim> hotdogs.
[11:01] <Nikashi> Yes, because at 1am PST, this room is a hotbed of political and social discussion
[11:01] <Propagandhim> hamburgers.
[11:01] <Propagandhim> freedom, etc.
[11:01] <Propagandhim> Nikashi

[11:01] <Propagandhim> we can be friends
[11:01] <Propagandhim> just calm down
[11:01] <Propagandhim> CLAM DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[11:01] <Propagandhim> CLAM!
[11:01] <Propagandhim> CALM!****
[11:02] <Nikashi> Propagandhim 
[11:02] <Nikashi> I think you should calm down.
[11:02] <Propagandhim> ok
[11:02] <Propagandhim> lets be friends
[11:02] <Mandoric> I got curious about mononobe's name because whenever there's a name made of really common kanji with the reading a bit off
[11:02] <Propagandhim> Mandoric what the hell are you taling about
[11:02] <Mandoric> it's usually related to ancient court functions
[11:03] <Mandoric> from there i just pounded on wiki and Papinot's until i confirmed my theories

[11:03] <Propagandhim> lets talk about Lunar: Eternal Blue
[11:03] <Propagandhim> great game.
[11:03] <Propagandhim> 5 stars.
[11:03] <Propagandhim> Hiro casts Triple Sword
[11:03] <Nikashi> Vic Ireland casts Fart Joke
[11:04] <Propagandhim> Vic Ireland is cool
[11:04] * Kab_Laptop has joined #GA
[11:04] <Propagandhim> at least the dialogue is entertaining
[11:04] <Mandoric> of course papinot is pretty lol as a source given that he published 99 years ago.
[11:05] <Propagandhim> Mandoric
[11:05] <Propagandhim> what
[11:05] <Propagandhim> are
[11:05] <Propagandhim> you
[11:05] <Propagandhim> talking about
[11:06] <Mandoric> srs japanese history.
[11:06] <Propagandhim> are you japanese?
[11:07] <Mandoric> no, but it's still interesting.  especially as knowing it is pretty antithetical to the average visual culture nerd's status.
[11:08] <Propagandhim> i don't know what antithetical means
[11:09] <EviLore> good thing you're on the internet then

[11:20] <Propagandhim> oh!
[11:20] <Mandoric> put more bluntly "lol animu fags don't give a fuck about anything predating gundam wing"
[11:22] <Propagandhim> oh
[11:22] <Kab_Laptop> Gundam Wing, lol, that shit was on TV here
[11:22] <Kab_Laptop> It was just people screaming and dying in cockpits
[11:22] <Kab_Laptop> It was retarded
[11:22] <Mandoric> pretty much
[11:23] <BudokaiMR2> i loved gundam wing
[11:23] <BudokaiMR2> <3
[11:23] <TToB> And little Chinese misogynists
[11:23] <TToB> lol Gundam Wing
[11:23] <Mandoric> gundam's always been notable for dragging shit up to the (at least it's sequential rather than episodal and people die for real) level of a standard TV military drama
[11:23] <TToB> G Gundam > Wing
[11:23] <Mandoric> and wing was the execs going "if we make all of the pilots sexy and ambiguously gay maybe women will watch too"
[11:24] <BudokaiMR2> i mean
[11:24] <Kab_Laptop> Any cartoon made ever outside of Japan > Gundam Wing
[11:24] <BudokaiMR2> gundam is retarded in general
[11:24] <Mandoric> (as damning as this sounds it still is a hell of an improvement over most of the gnere, or most of japanese tv in general)
[11:24] <BudokaiMR2> its most common formula is putting a pacifist in the cockpit of a walking death machine
[11:24] <BudokaiMR2> well either a pacifist 
[11:24] <BudokaiMR2> or an emo pacifist
[11:24] <Mandoric> idk
[11:25] <BudokaiMR2> who might go crazy for a while
[11:25] <BudokaiMR2> I just thought Hiro was awesome
[11:25] <EviLore> hrm, latest mars volta is interesting
[11:25] <BudokaiMR2> i mean he was a pretty cool anti-hero most of the time
[11:25] <Mandoric> amuro was neither, kamille was only emo, shiro was neither, christine was neither, loran was kinda pacifistic,...
[11:25] <Mandoric> oh, and Domon was neither.
[11:26] <BudokaiMR2> amuro was pacifist eventually
[11:26] <Kab_Laptop> http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/531391/7383c87d/post_it_stop_motion.html
[11:26] <BudokaiMR2> but yeah not so much at the beginning
[11:26] <BudokaiMR2> [he just knew how to get shit down
[11:26] <Mandoric> otoh I've basically listed the good gundams there, not counting V which I kinda skipped through.
[11:26] <Mandoric> idk he went emo pacifist and then came back
[11:27] <Mandoric> pretty much all of Z and big chunks of CCA was "how do we get the main characters to realize they need to finish their business"
[11:27] <BudokaiMR2> but yeah the new ones are always about being some super pacifist who can shoot the sensors off robots to win battles
[11:28] <Mandoric> 00 season 1 wasn't too bad, but the ball was just completely dropped when it came back between the execs getting involved and the fallout between the director and writer.
[11:28] <Kab_Laptop> Japan and pacifism, lol
[11:28] <BudokaiMR2> i dont know what the lol is for
[11:28] <Mandoric> And standard behavior when the ball is dropped is to go "welp make him a perfect hero so we can sell more kits to 8-year-olds"
[11:28] <BudokaiMR2> japan is the best example of pacifism there is
[11:29] <BudokaiMR2> they are basically the only people who have any understanding of what it would be like if shit really hit hte fan
[11:29] <TToB> lol
[11:29] <BudokaiMR2> its pretty crazy
[11:29] <BudokaiMR2> been watching stuff like madmen recently
[11:30] <BudokaiMR2> and to think that the whole world has been living under the thread of "the bomb"
[11:30] <BudokaiMR2> for over 50 years
[11:30] <TToB> Japan = Let's side with the wrong guys, get made an example of, make crazy fcked up porn. :D
[11:30] <TToB> thread?
[11:30] <Kab_Laptop> Let's side with the wrong guys?
[11:30] <TToB> Good thing it's not a threat.
[11:30] <BudokaiMR2> they were on their own side
[11:30] <Kab_Laptop> Japan was the badguy looooong before the rest of the Axis had even gone fascist/national-socialist
[11:30] <Nikashi> Oh god, I was watching HDTV Conan O'Brien tonight
[11:31] <Nikashi> and he showed the Phil Spector pic
[11:31] <Nikashi> jksdfjkla;sfj
[11:31] <Mandoric> on the one hand a lot of Japanese policy post-restoration was certifiably evil by modern standards
[11:31] <BudokaiMR2> oh well
[11:31] <BudokaiMR2> japanese people have no souls
[11:31] <BudokaiMR2> so that is completely understandable
[11:31] <Mandoric> OTOH given that their direct motivation and implementation was "we've got to play catchup in the evil game with the Europeans" it's a bit hypocritical to go "ffff japan" rather than "fffff imperialism"
[11:31] <BudokaiMR2> yeah i mean
[11:31] <TToB> Obviously, it also explains why the porn stars don't enjoy the sexor!
[11:31] <BudokaiMR2> they learned the ropes from us
[11:32] <BudokaiMR2> and decided to try it on asia
[11:32] <Kab_Laptop> It's just that Japan really upped the ante in brutality 
[11:32] <TToB> NO SOUL
[11:32] <BudokaiMR2> but in the end they stillc ame out on top
[11:32] <TToB> Their vacant eyes and yelps :(
[11:32] <BudokaiMR2> because they are only what they are today because of all the gold they managed to steal
[11:32] <Mandoric> it's all by-the-books imperialism, they just had the bad luck to have attempted it in a war that eventually involved the Americans.
[11:32] <Mandoric> And, of course, done it at a timew hen it could be efficiently industrialized.
[11:33] <BudokaiMR2> yes
[11:33] <Kab_Laptop> Well Japan should've known it could never win
[11:33] <Kab_Laptop> They got annihilated by just the Soviet Union, going to war with ALL other major powers whilst not being safe from the USSR at the same time, not the greatest of ideas.
[11:33] <TToB> Kab_Laptop: That flies in the face of every super robot anime though. :(
[11:33] <Mandoric> The actions of imperial Japan at war tended toward the truly disgusting, but they form a far better basis for critique of imperialism after full industrialization than of Japan.
[11:34] <Mandoric> And the idea was never to win, they just misunderestimated America's nai"vete.
[11:34] <Kab_Laptop> Winning doesn't have to mean the conquest of the opponent
[11:35] <Mandoric> A more mature imperial power would've taken losses at a colonial garrison in stride, but America, uh.
[11:35] <Mandoric> Let's go back to the Gundam for a minute, ironically.
[11:35] <BudokaiMR2> well basically
[11:35] <Mandoric> America went "Even my own dad never smacked me!" and decided to pursue the Pacific War as a life or death matter.
[11:35] <BudokaiMR2> pearl harbor was a genius strategic move, except for the fact that it was a horrible fucking idea
[11:35] <BudokaiMR2> lol
[11:36] <Kab_Laptop> And the fact that they failed completely tactically
[11:36] <Kab_Laptop> Not sending the third wave of planes, lolz
[11:36] <BudokaiMR2> i didn't know there was supposed to be a third wave
[11:36] <BudokaiMR2> heh
[11:37] <Mandoric> Were the US even still a British possession it would've considered dominance over the Pacific vital, but not a matter of national survival, and would've pursued the war like the British with constant opposition but a willingness to accept a standstill.
[11:37] <Kab_Laptop> Japan wasn't exactly great in tactics, they had some nice tactical moves, but mostly ,they just relied on individual courage and numbers
[11:39] <Mandoric> It's only that unwillingness to accept our first imperial humiliation, unwillingness to see Japanese raids on an imperial fleet in a colony as a game of give-and-take that we'd never been in, that lead to the tremendous pouring-in of men and materiel toward conquest of the entire pPacific and then the home islands.
[11:40] <Mandoric> As a game of imperial give-and-take, as Japan saw it, it probably would've ended with the oil embargo upheld, outlying island possesions flipped to the US, and a settlement that we could pursue our interests in Europe and they theirs in China.
[11:40] <Mandoric> Hell, with slightly worse luck at Midway, it may have been that still.
[11:40] <Kab_Laptop> Perhaps, but I'd like to think that a foreign raid on, say, Vladivostok, would have provoked quite the response from the USSR as well.
[11:41] <Mandoric> It probably would have.  The USSR was another young, idealistic nation.
[11:41] <Kab_Laptop> Also, I don't think the US would have been content with leaving China to the Japanese, given that it was supporting the Chinese as early as 1937
[11:41] <Mandoric> On the other hands the Brits had no intention of going "for every day you hold Singapore we'll hold Kyoto".
[11:42] <Kab_Laptop> Yeah, but I think that was more due to the fact that Londoners spent every night in subway tunnels rather than in their homes than it had to do with any colonial policy.
[11:42] <Mandoric> Even without the Blitz, there's a certain, uh.
[11:43] <Mandoric> Lack of dedication to total war when it comprises only colonial possessions.
[11:43] <Kab_Laptop> Well sure, but then, in the case of the US it didn't just comprise colonial possessions.
[11:44] <Propagandhim> dear gaf
[11:44] <Propagandhim> i have arrived at ultimate consciousness
[11:44] <Mandoric> In a hypothetical naval war between the British and Japanese, all else excluded, it's most reasonable to presume that either side would seek to remove the other's force projection capabilities during the current generation of ships, rather than but the full force of the home nation behind a risky attempt to acheive total dominance.
[11:44] <Mandoric> Were total dominance the goal the British would have put far more force into their own colonial ambitions in China and the islands.
[11:45] <Kab_Laptop> It's really very hard to say given the position of the British empire at the time.
[11:45] <Mandoric> And at the time of the war, pretty much everything American west of LA was a colonial possession.
[11:45] <Mandoric> Hawaii was a colony, Alaska was an unincorporated territory, the Phillipines were some kind of dependency the term for which escapes me.
[11:45] <Kab_Laptop> The British were broke, the empire was already falling to pieces long before WW2 started.
[11:46] <Kab_Laptop> Puppet state might be the right term for the Philippines :P
[11:46] <Nikashi> Protectorate I think is the word
[11:46] <Propagandhim> why are we talking about history
[11:46] <Mandoric> In terms of a fistfight over a checkers match, all of them were the pieces, none the player's arm.
[11:47] <Mandoric> Even when the British were rich, they held a rather nonchalant attitude toward colonial possessions, common among imperial powers.
[11:47] <Propagandhim> I'm going to bed
[11:48] <Propagandhim> this history talk made me sleepy
[11:48] * Propagandhim has quit IRC (Quit: )
[11:48] <Mandoric> The perception of "mine" rather than "me" is really, really strong.
[11:48] <EviLore> shit, didn't kb him in time
[11:48] <Mandoric> And one will go much further protecting "me" rather than "mine".
[11:48] <Kab_Laptop> I suppose you're right about that yeah
[11:49] <Kab_Laptop> Still, I really think the British empire would've done a lot more had they not been at war with the Germans
[11:49] <Kab_Laptop> And I mean a LOT
[11:50] <Mandoric> oh, of course
[11:50] <Kab_Laptop> They had to dedicate most of their fleet to doing things like escorting convoys
[11:50] <Kab_Laptop> Or sinking German convoys in the Mediterranean
[11:51] <Mandoric> but "sink the IJN, shell every major city, impose Weimar-style naval tonnage limits, take as much of China as they could find minor nobility and Oxbridge-educated merchant sons to manage"
[11:51] <Mandoric> while it's definitely a lot
[11:52] <Mandoric> pales in comparison to "nuke, occupy for a decade, impose constitution creating the first non-military world power"
[11:53] <Kab_Laptop> True, they definitely wouldn't have gone that far
[11:53] <Kab_Laptop> They probably would've been satisfied by sinking most major ships of the IJN and retaking Singapore and their bits of Borneo.
[11:54] <Kab_Laptop> But then, I really do think Pearl Harbour hit a lot closer to home.
[11:54] <Mandoric> oh, it certainly did
[11:54] <Kab_Laptop> As is evidenced by the fact that people were selling houses on the West-Coast for pennies on the dollar right afterwards.
[11:54] <Kab_Laptop> Singapore is still the other side of the world
[11:54] <Mandoric> I'm just arguing that it hit closer to home because America was new to imperialism
[11:56] <Kab_Laptop> That's the part I'm not sure of tbh :P. 
[11:56] <Mandoric> Washington to Honolulu is 5 hours, Singapore is 8.  Singapore's longer, but if you consider India and California similar they're about the same
[11:56] <Mandoric> in terms of "massively-important outlying region, of which (fallen territory) constituted the main first defensive line"
[11:57] <Mandoric> er, "london to singapore"
[11:57] <Mandoric> America had had, what, two imperial wars?  Three counting with the Mexicans, which is borderline just plain border war.
[11:58] <Mandoric> And both were successes; we threw Spain out of Cuba and maid the Phillipines a protectorate.
[11:58] <Kab_Laptop> Washington to Honolulu isn't what matters though :P. LA to Honolulu does :P. You said before that anything West of LA is what counts as colonial, so LA itself doesn't :P.
[11:58] <Kab_Laptop> I would go with two yes
[11:58] <Nikashi> wait
[11:59] <Nikashi> and yes, I know you're gonna call me on WHY I brought this p
[11:59] <Nikashi> up
[11:59] <Mandoric> > canadian lol.
[11:59] <Nikashi> but what was the war of 1812 exactly (if not imperial)
[11:59] <Mandoric> > bc is just as close to hawaii as seattle is
[11:59] <Mandoric> oh wow I was wrong.
[11:59] <Kab_Laptop> The war of 1812 was about nothing.
[11:59] <Kab_Laptop> It was the most meaningless war ever
[12:00] <Kab_Laptop> It makes WW1 look logical
[12:01] <Mandoric> 1812 was about "no, you shut the fuck up, dad"
[12:01] <Kab_Laptop> Yah
[12:03] <Kab_Laptop> It's pretty awesome how many wars the US fought that just really didn't have a point nor won it anything (other than reputation in the case of the War of 1812)
[12:03] <Mandoric> to be fair, most wars are that
[12:04] <Kab_Laptop> I dunno, most of ours were fought to maintain our position in trade or to expand colonial possessions
[12:04] <Kab_Laptop> Only useless ones I can think of are Iraq and Afghanistan.
[12:06] <Mandoric> Afghanistan is a several-hour "you won't extradite?  well fuck you" operation turned into several years of futility care of Rumsfeld.
[12:07] <Mandoric> Iraq is, uhh
[12:07] <Mandoric> I remmember the "no blood for oil" anticolonialism protesters.
[12:07] * DrForester has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[12:07] <Mandoric> Last year, paying $4 a fucking gallon for gas, all I could think was "welp hell the blood's already there how did they fuck it up so hard that we didn't get the oil anyway"
[12:08] <Kab_Laptop> $4 a gallon, goddamn
[12:08] <Kab_Laptop> I remember last year too
[12:08] <Kab_Laptop> $11 a gallon
[12:08] <Kab_Laptop> That was quite something :P
[12:08] <Mandoric> well
[12:08] <Mandoric> i'm speaking in American terms
[12:09] <Mandoric> I'd be glad to pay $11 a gallon if I could ride the train to work, get my medical bills paid, pay nothing for college, and collect unemployment targeted to leave its recipients in the lower middle class
[12:10] <Kab_Laptop> Trains are always late, I'm gonna have to pay for my medication from next year on, I do pay for university, and well, I could collect unemployment, you're right on that :P
[12:10] <Mandoric> the problem is that of the $4 a gallon $2 went to House Al-Saud and $1.50 went to Exxon, leaving 50 cents to split between taxes for public services and the poor Indian fucker trying to sell it to me
[12:11] <Kab_Laptop> http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/lowcountries/milxnederland.html < Not really anything useless here other than what I mentioned here before btw.
[12:11] <Kab_Laptop> Who wouldn't want to support the dictators who indirectly brought you Osama Bin Laden?
[12:11] <Mandoric> if of that $4 $3 went to the government and came right back to me as public services I'd be perfectly happy
[12:14] <Mandoric> fuck, it's $2.50 now, if they imposed $1.50 a gallon tax and dumped in in the general fund that'd halve the (well, prewar) natianal deficit.  Or fund free health and university.
[12:14] <Mandoric> Or multiply the rail budget by 20x.
[12:14] <Mandoric> Without raising prices over the obviously-sustainable level we hit last summer.
[12:15] <Mandoric> and honestly, I mean, trains being late isn't good per se
[12:15] <Mandoric> but if they're always 15 minutes late
[12:15] <Mandoric> it becames pretty simple to just take the "3:45" rather than the 4:00
[12:15] <Kab_Laptop> It's never the same time :(
[12:16] <Kab_Laptop> I've once taken seven hours on a two hour trip
[12:16] <EviLore> wow, qt3 is insanely ignorant about MMA
[12:16] <EviLore> "it's like pro wrestling"
[12:16] <Mandoric> the problem is that in the US
[12:16] <Kab_Laptop> (Okay, someone jumped in front of the train, but still!)
[12:16] <EviLore> "no, it's like pro boxing!"
[12:16] <Mandoric> it's like that all the time
[12:16] <Mandoric> because outside of one particular line
[12:16] <TToB> Swiss honenone vaccine?! :o
[12:16] <EviLore> "why isn't there a 10 count when someone gets knocked down"
[12:16] <Mandoric> commercial shipping has line priority
[12:16] <EviLore> etc.
[12:16] <Mandoric> and all the rolling stock is old as fuck
[12:16] <Kab_Laptop> Well we need our rails precisely because of our shipping
[12:16] <Mandoric> I once spent six hours sitting on the platform in Syracuse, New York
[12:17] <Kab_Laptop> Without a decent enough rail system, Germany would just use Hamburg instead of Rotterdam
[12:17] <Kab_Laptop> And we can't have that stuf
[12:17] <Kab_Laptop> *stuff
[12:17] <Mandoric> because, drumroll, "tracks get too hot when it's over 25 degrees"
[12:17] <Kab_Laptop> Oh, here it's always in the fall
[12:17] <Kab_Laptop> Leaves on the tracks
[12:17] <Kab_Laptop> SQUARE WHEELS
[12:17] <TToB> Hahaha Obama's teachers note.
[12:17] <Kab_Laptop> Seriously, wth, leaves on the tracks are a problem?
[12:18] <Kab_Laptop> Also, whenever there's a tiny little bit of snow, the entire transport infrastructure in this country basically goes down.
[12:18] <Kab_Laptop> You'd be shocked
[12:21] <EviLore> that's pretty strange

[12:36] <duckroll> argahrgahrhagh
[12:37] <duckroll> ep10 was super infuriating
[12:37] <duckroll> on one hand
[12:37] <duckroll> the music is ZOMG dramatic
[12:37] <duckroll> and the story slips into this really nice climatic movement
[12:37] <duckroll> and you're getting answers, kinda
[12:37] <duckroll> on the other hand
[12:37] <duckroll> you know its NOT the final episode
[12:37] <duckroll> lol
[12:38] <EviLore> I'm not caught up
[12:38] <duckroll> ep11 is going to be interesting
[12:38] <duckroll> at this point
[12:38] <duckroll> it could be the end
[12:38] <duckroll> or the movie could be the end
[12:38] <duckroll> its -still- unclear
[12:38] <duckroll> and i think they're planning on leaving it that way
[12:40] <rk> ...
[12:40] <rk> So where do you order HDD cases for the PS3?
[12:41] <Mandoric> define "cases"
[12:41] <rk> Define fuck you?
[12:41] <rk> The case for the PS3 HDD? What the hell else could I mean
[12:41] <rk> It is the case that goes on the HDD?
[12:41] <rk> There is an enclosure for the hard disk device for the Sony Playstation 3 and I would like to go about acquiring them?
[12:41] <Mandoric> yeah I didn't know if you meant the internal bracket or the external lolbracket for chubby hdds or just and enclosure.
[12:42] <rk> Because sony's tight ass screws stripped and now I can't get the HDD out
[12:42] <rk> Of course it was the last damn screw
[12:42] <EviLore> rip it open and then duct tape
[12:42] <rk> Rip what open?
[12:43] <EviLore> define what
[12:43] <rk> Define it

[12:51] <Mandoric> you can just pliers the old one apart and be sure not to shake the ps3 around

[00:08] <osaka> did he die
[00:08] <EviLore> unknown
[00:08] <Acosta> meh, too bad
[00:09] <KimiNewt> that's funny because you want him dead
[00:09] <syllogism> UPDATE: A Jackson family member tells TMZ Michael is in "really bad shape" and the brothers are headed to UCLA
[00:10] <KimiNewt> implication of murderous urges are always a source great humour
[00:10] <EviLore> Beat it, michael, beat it!  etc.
[00:10] <osaka> i see what you did EviLore 
[00:10] <osaka> it was clever
[00:11] <happy_phantom> well played
[00:11] <KimiNewt> "really bad shape"? We knew that for a while now
[00:12] <Wes_Wimbledon> DAMN YOU EVILORE
[00:12] <Wes_Wimbledon> DAMN YOU BY SECONDS
[00:12] <EviLore> pfft
[00:13] <KimiNewt> Wait
[00:13] <KimiNewt> Do you mean "beat it" like in
[00:13] <KimiNewt> Beat the disease
[00:13] <EviLore> his heart
[00:13] <KimiNewt> or "Beat it" like "get out"
[00:13] <EviLore> ...
[00:13] <KimiNewt> Wow this works in like three levels then
[00:13] <KimiNewt> I think
[00:13] <Wes_Wimbledon> meta pun
[00:14] <KimiNewt> Although one is the original meaning, I think it's still fine
[00:14] <KimiNewt> Also: I didn't get any replies to either of my two texts so I guess I got the answer to that question.
[00:15] <Sea_Manky> Kimi's good enough with English that it's really hard to tell where his difficulty with idioms ends and his terribly awkward straight man tendencies begin.
[00:16] <Sea_Manky> And before you ask, I am not referring to sexuality, but rather the type who is unable to get jokes.
[00:16] <KimiNewt> I'm familiar with that one actually
[00:16] <KimiNewt> Not at all because I google'd it
[00:16] <EviLore> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=16434706&postcount=42
[00:16] <EviLore> wonder how many people will
[00:17] <KimiNewt> "his dead"
[00:17] <Sea_Manky> Well, that'll be an improvement for the server load
[00:17] <KimiNewt> Is there like an "English day"? Where maybe you could just ban people who make that terrible a spelling error?

[00:20] <Sea_Manky> you know, I was in grade school when Thriller came out, and to this day I still don't get how it was that popular.  It was a good album and all, but the result has been a near cult.
[00:21] <Wes_Wimbledon> I'm glad you beat me now EviLore. I'm not getting any of the backlash.
[00:22] <Wes_Wimbledon> http://www.michaeljackson.com/ hmmmmm yeah I think some of those conerts are doomed

[00:40] <KimiNewt> don't you think "Unending holocaust of pain" is a little weak as a description of pain
[00:40] <KimiNewt> Some people in 07 found it to be incredibly extreme
[00:40] <Scarlet> so farrah died today..and michael jackson possibly too today?
[00:40] <DrForester> yeah except base don intial reports, farrah died of cancer, and MJ (rumored) killed himself
[00:41] <KimiNewt> What has changed since 07, have we become so used to unending holocausts of pain that we're basically desensitized to what was once considered the greatest pain imaginable

[00:52] <OrinX> hoping TMZ fucked up
[00:52] <DrForester> If wiki says he's alive, then he's alive
[00:52] <jakehk> tru
[00:52] <DrForester> TMZ could be predicting death tol try and scoop everyone
[00:52] <Kab_Laptop> Wiki = always correct
[00:52] <DrForester> They can always retract
[00:52] <Shuri> TMZ talked to his father like 1 hour agao

[00:56] <happy_phantom> honestly, his death doesn't mean much to me at this point since I haven't been too interested in him as of late. His last album was decent though
[00:56] <jakehk> ban this man
[00:56] <Shinobi_EuroU21> but I guess that tour will be postponed for a while regardless
[00:56] <Kab_Laptop> Oh god, there's going to be complete media saturation over this. Every news station, magazine, tv channel will be pumping coverage of his life 24/7 for the next week. Real issues like the Iranian elections will lose the oxygen of publicity and will disappear.
[00:56] <osaka> oh now he died
[00:57] <Tiduz> what a clusterfuck
[00:57] <Kab_Laptop> God yessssssssssssssssssssss
[00:57] <osaka> ?
[00:57] <Tiduz> is he dead or not
[00:57] <Kab_Laptop> Michael Jackson on TV
[00:57] <Kab_Laptop> Less Iranians in the streets
[00:57] <Kab_Laptop> WE WIN
[00:57] <Shuri> kab: its not like media coverage can change anything about the situation in Iran
[00:57] <EviLore> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=16435494&postcount=359
[00:57] <EviLore> uhhhh
[00:57] <Kab_Laptop> No, but media coverage can play every Michael Jackson song a hundred times over. Which would finally give me a reason to watch a lot of TV again.
[00:58] <DrForester> A popular pedophile died, Iran won't be talked abotu in the news for a week
[00:58] <EviLore> just equated pedophilia with homosexuality
[00:58] <Shuri> it's GuyBrush Threepwood
[00:58] <Kab_Laptop> Permban that fool
[00:58] <Shuri> look at his mustache
[00:58] <kassatsu> lol
[00:58] <Y2Kev_> yeah, permaba
[00:58] <Y2Kev_> KILL HIM
[00:58] <Shuri> he deserves punishment
[00:58] <osaka> dead yes/no
[00:58] <Kab_Laptop> Fox News saying dead
[00:59] <Acosta> listening beat it is heartbreaking  
[00:59] <Kab_Laptop> "This is a BIG death. Ledger/Carlin worthy."
[00:59] <Kab_Laptop> lol
[00:59] <DrForester> pedophiel stuff's bound to come up guys
[00:59] <Kab_Laptop> Yeah...this is JUST on that level
[00:59] <Acosta> pure awesomeness
[00:59] <Shuri> lol LEDGER
[00:59] <Kab_Laptop> Fuck man
[00:59] <jakehk> lol @ comparin mj to heath leger
[00:59] <jakehk> get the fuck out
[00:59] <Shuri> HaHA~
[00:59] <Acosta> Ledger?
[00:59] <DrForester> It's like if OJ died you think the thread is only going to be about his great football playing and Naked Gun movies?
[00:59] <Shinobi_EuroU21> yeah with all due respect to ledger
[00:59] <Shinobi_EuroU21> sorry, he's not at jacko's level
[00:59] <Kab_Laptop> There are like five people on earth who don't know who Michael Jackson is
[00:59] <happy_phantom> MJ is way more important than ledger
[00:59] <Kab_Laptop> Fucking Khameini probably blasts Beat It every day
[01:00] <Shuri> sorry but
[01:00] <Y2Kev_> Kab_Laptop: haha
[01:00] <Y2Kev_> so true
[01:00] <Shuri> nobody cared much about ledger before he overdosed his ass
[01:00] <Amir0x> Michael Jackson was acquitted of his charges so he's not a pedophile
[01:00] <Shuri> well he was in brokeback montain but the hype had died down
[01:00] <Amir0x> he just sleeps with boys who are not his sons
[01:00] <Amir0x> and multiple kids have said he touched them 
[01:00] <Amir0x> hmmmmmm
[01:00] <bjork-wtf> fuck off
[01:00] <jakehk> no one would have cared if he wasnt in the nerds ultimate dream movie
[01:00] <bjork-wtf> go sock your mom
[01:00] <bjork-wtf> dick
[01:00] <Shinobi_EuroU21> jacko's arguably one of the ten greatest musical talents of the 20th century
[01:00] <Amir0x> sorry bjork your idol is a pedophile freak
[01:00] <Amir0x> accept it now or kill yourself
[01:00] <jakehk> ten?
[01:00] * EviLore changes topic to 'Thriller, man, Thriller'
[01:01] <Kab_Laptop> I think he's pretty much in the top 5
[01:01] <EviLore> this is a damn good album
[01:01] <Y2Kev_> i really hate people die in threes meme
[01:01] <Shinobi_EuroU21> oh there's plenty that could be put in that group
[01:01] <Y2Kev_> i hope someone else dies so everyone shuts the fuck up
[01:01] <Shinobi_EuroU21> which is why i said arguable
[01:01] <Wes_> oddly enough I was reading about Freddie Mercury's death last night.
[01:01] <Y2Kev_> but then they will be like "omg two more are going to die!"
[01:01] <Shinobi_EuroU21> gotta look at all different types of music
[01:01] <Shuri> why isnt cnn updating
[01:01] <Amir0x> Evilore

[01:01] <Tiduz> mj looked bad
[01:01] <Amir0x> seriously Evilore
[01:01] <Shinobi_EuroU21> but if you take impact into account, jacko's got few peers
[01:01] <kassatsu> he is just digging a deeper hole
[01:01] <Shuri> do it
[01:01] <Amir0x> that has to be bannable
[01:01] <syllogism> Michael Jackson eyes $50 million concert payday Ottawa Citizen - Ray Waddell - ?13 minutes ago?
[01:01] <EviLore> of course you can, ami
[01:01] <Tiduz> but iu never expected this

[01:02] <Y2Kev_> "

[01:03] <Shinobi_EuroU21> well
[01:03] <DrForester> OJ isn't going to be remembered for football or Naked Gun films
[01:03] <Shinobi_EuroU21> sega did make those moonwalker games

[01:05] <Acosta> man, I'm about to cry, I shouldn't listening smooth criminal
[01:05] <Scarlet> ed mcmahon 2 days ago
[01:05] <Shuri> hahaha DrForester
[01:05] <Acosta> I grew listening that song
[01:05] <Shinobi_EuroU21> jacko might be remembered as much for the pedo allegations as his music, but to say he won't be remembered for his music is completely and utterly insane
[01:05] <Tiduz> i was a mj fan as a kid
[01:05] <Tiduz> :x
[01:05] <Kab_Laptop> Better be the Moonwalker version Acosta
[01:05] <Shuri> yeah sadly shin
[01:05] <Kab_Laptop> That is just one of the greatest movie scenes ever
[01:05] <Shuri> his music is incredible
[01:05] <Acosta> yes
[01:05] <Shuri> and the thing is
[01:05] <Shinobi_EuroU21> OJ on the other hand played his pro football before espn was even born, which means in today's world, his career barely mattered anyway
[01:05] <Shuri> is that he's was really wrote everything
[01:05] <Acosta> I didn't understand the movie at all but that scene was aweosme
[01:05] <Hitokage> Shinobi_EuroU21: hahaha
[01:05] <jett> apparently there's no real confirmation that mj is dead yet
[01:05] <Hitokage> according to ESPN anyway
[01:06] <Tiduz> lets hope
[01:06] <Tiduz> he used up alot of his money
[01:06] <jett> neogayf kind of jumped the gun there
[01:06] <Tiduz> and has a bionic heart
[01:06] <Shuri> yeah
[01:06] <Kab_Laptop> I don't think anyone to this day understands that movie outside of MJ himself Acosta
[01:06] <Tiduz> MJ Immortal!
[01:06] <DrForester> TMZ is just calling death I think, they can always retract and blame it on a erroneous source
[01:06] <Kab_Laptop> Maybe he'll turn into a giant robot
[01:06] <Shinobi_EuroU21> and skating from a double homicide that most competent lawyers would've hung on him, it's a bit different MJ
[01:06] <EviLore> neogayf?
[01:06] <Kab_Laptop> And kill Joe Pesci
[01:06] <Shinobi_EuroU21> a lot different actually
[01:06] <BJ> *remembers when OJ was on some ESPN interview and it went over like 30 minutes delaying sportscenter

[01:09] <DrForester> MSNBC.... "Thrilling Times"
[01:09] <Shuri> Michael Jackson was rushed by ambulance to the UCLA Medical Center just after 1pm pct. TMZ says he suffered cardiac arrest and paramedics administered CPR in the ambulance. A family member told them, “he’s in really bad shape.” The original 911 call was placed at 12:21pm. The ambulance would have been dispatched sooner, but Perez thought he saw a spider and spent the next two hours on Twitter begging people to call the police.

[01:33] <Kab_Laptop> Gives database errors
[01:33] <Sea_Manky> DrF: I'm guessing the spelling would be better, at the least.
[01:33] <Wes_> or potentials
[01:33] <Tiduz> all the bannings are deserved
[01:34] <EGM92> Patrick swayze :(
[01:34] <Unison> http://deadpool.rotten.com/
[01:34] <OrinX> wikipedia: Michael Joseph Jackson (born August 29, 1958 and died June 25, 2009) was an American recording artist, entertainer, and businessman.
[01:34] <OrinX> hes dead
[01:34] <Unison> THERE WE GO
[01:34] <Sea_Manky> "Golly gee whiz, I can't believe the King is dead, shucks."
[01:34] <Shinobi_EuroU21> swayze's fighting like a motherfucker
[01:34] <Unison> rotten.com, of course!
[01:34] <Shinobi_EuroU21> from all accounts he should've died months ago
[01:34] <bjork-wtf> Mank> "Good, he stole rock and roll from the black man" etc
[01:34] <Shinobi_EuroU21> lulz
[01:34] <DrForester> <Tiduz> all the bannings are deserved <- again like it or not the bad stuff is part of his legacy
[01:34] <Tiduz> And swayze still smokes too
[01:34] <Tiduz> mind blown
[01:34] <Sea_Manky> So I'm guessing it'll be a quick funeral, no embalming necessary?
[01:34] <DrForester> it's going to be brought up
[01:34] <Shinobi_EuroU21> haha
[01:34] <Lo-Volt> Actually, the BBC was also relatively slow about Diana's death, too. Even when wire services said Diana died, the BBC called it unconfirmed.
[01:34] <Tiduz> i dont care about that DrForester
[01:34] <Shinobi_EuroU21> swayze rocks
[01:34] <Kab_Laptop> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2009 < wow lol, Wikipedia just has everything.

[01:35] <bjork-wtf> true
[01:35] <Unison> 10 	Michael Jackson 	King of Pop 	29-Aug-1958 	4,899
[01:35] <Unison> Jackson was 10

[01:35] <Unison> in # of predictions
[01:35] <Unison> hhahhaha
[01:35] <Sea_Manky> SEPERATE BUT EQUAL INTERNET ACCESS
[01:35] <Wes_> Why in the helicopter footage is everyoen standing around a 2x2metre patch of grass?
[01:35] <Shinobi_EuroU21> wikipedia probably has PROBABLE deaths of '09 as well
[01:35] <Unison> Courtney Love beat him
[01:35] <Unison> she was looking gaunt this week
[01:35] <Kab_Laptop> "financially he had problems"
[01:35] <Sea_Manky> black side of town always gets shitty pings
[01:35] <Unison> probably not long for this world
[01:35] <bjork-wtf> the black-only internet terminal is on a 9600 baud
[01:35] <Kab_Laptop> With a 100k/month rent, I'm not particularly shocked
[01:35] <Tiduz> courtney love isnt human
[01:36] <Shinobi_EuroU21> that's what billy corgan says
[01:36] <Unison> he got the rent bill
[01:36] <Unison> dropped dead
[01:36] <Unison> easy to understand
[01:36] <Kab_Laptop> Probably Unison
[01:36] <minty> ;<
[01:36] <Acosta> the bad stuff is part of his life
[01:36] <Shinobi_EuroU21> haha uni
[01:36] <Acosta> the legacy is his music
[01:36] <bjork-wtf> unison's having too much fun with this :

[01:36] <Unison> LOL DrF
[01:36] <Shinobi_EuroU21> hahaha
[01:36] <Shinobi_EuroU21> so, so wrong
[01:36] <bjork-wtf> well I guess if you wanna think so
[01:36] <bjork-wtf> but there was nobody bigger, at one point
[01:37] <Shinobi_EuroU21> uni's the one guy who can poke fun at stuff and it doesn't offend me
[01:37] <Shinobi_EuroU21> mainly cause he always jokes like this
[01:37] <Lo-Volt> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=16435322&postcount=256 WTF!
[01:37] <DrForester> Bjork, we need to maintain a working hiarchy of pop singers
[01:37] <Kab_Laptop> Wires reporting it, final then
[01:37] <DrForester> even in troubled times
[01:37] <Unison> i take it all in stride
[01:37] <Shinobi_EuroU21> well from what cnn's saying
[01:37] <Tiduz> Shinobi_EuroU21: desensitized
[01:37] <DrForester> That's why one prominate pop singer stays away fromt eh POP awards every year
[01:37] <bjork-wtf> lo> it's ok because he's a pedo etc
[01:37] <Shinobi_EuroU21> if you get a cardiac arrest
[01:37] <Unison> expet the worst, and the world delivers in spades
[01:37] <Shinobi_EuroU21> and you're not tended to within 5 minutes
[01:37] <Unison> *expect
[01:37] <Shinobi_EuroU21> your odds are sorta low
[01:37] <Kab_Laptop> I'm not hugely upset over this
[01:37] <Shinobi_EuroU21> and if you slip into a coma
[01:37] <Lo-Volt> Look, if the LA Times says it, call it. The paper is still very reliable.
[01:37] <Shinobi_EuroU21> you're really drawing the short straw
[01:37] <Kab_Laptop> Don't get why people are really
[01:38] <Tiduz> if he lived hed prob be in a wheelchair
[01:38] <OrinX> LA times are thieves and liars Lo
[01:38] <Lo-Volt> Well, he provided the soundtrack of the lives of a lot of people?
[01:38] <DrForester> CNN still not calling it
[01:38] <Kab_Laptop> Yes.
[01:38] <OrinX> and run by the jewish media
[01:38] <Kab_Laptop> A soundtrack you can still listen to
[01:38] <Lo-Volt> His mark on popular music is very notable.
[01:38] <Kab_Laptop> And it's not like he was working on more good music
[01:38] <Lo-Volt> My mother visited and found out, so she's actually pretty sad.
[01:38] <Kab_Laptop> I LOVE Michael Jackson's music 
[01:38] <Wes_> All the newspapers are reporting it as "death" or "dies" or "dead". As in the inverted comments means he's not actually dead.
[01:38] <minty> jacko didn't die. he just faked his death like 2pac
[01:38] <Unison> yeah kab
[01:38] <Kab_Laptop> But let's face it, the man was already dead musically ages ago
[01:38] <Unison> exactly
[01:38] <Tiduz> http://img.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pcn-ashlee__oPt.jpg
[01:39] <Tiduz> lol ashlee simpson
[01:39] <Lo-Volt> Also true. :/
[01:39] <bjork-wtf> Kab> I don't expect people to be sad, but they could lay off until the body's cold imo
[01:39] <Unison> he's made his contributions
[01:39] <Shinobi_EuroU21> cbs news has also confirmed his death btw
[01:39] <Shinobi_EuroU21> so you know
[01:39] <Unison> now he was just racking up bad debt
[01:39] <Kab_Laptop> Sure bjork-wtf
[01:39] <Scarlet> nbc too
[01:39] <Shinobi_EuroU21> I'm basically hanging onto cnn now
[01:39] <Kab_Laptop> Nothing wrong with a little respect
[01:39] <Wes_> why cnn
[01:39] * Armitage slaps Tiduz around a bit with a large trout
[01:39] <Kab_Laptop> But the people who are being all drama queen about this are annoying
[01:39] <EviLore> CNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[01:39] <Armitage> talking bout real celebrities k
[01:39] <Tiduz> how can he slap
[01:39] <ghst> bjork, i'd like to attend a box social sometime soon too
[01:39] <OrinX> It's slander
[01:39] <Shinobi_EuroU21> cause cnn's the one big news source that hasn't confirmed his death
[01:39] <Shinobi_EuroU21> so I'm holding out hope!
[01:39] <OrinX> With the words you use
[01:39] <EviLore> cnn sucks
[01:39] <Lo-Volt> BBC sez family members were running into UCLA's hospital.
[01:39] <Shinobi_EuroU21> billie jean on cnn now btw
[01:39] <OrinX> You're a parasite in black and white
[01:39] <Acosta> I don't really care if people respect him or not, I have no personal opinion about MJ the person
[01:40] <OrinX> Do anything for news
[01:40] <Unison> did you ever see that movie The Legend of Billie Jean?
[01:40] <Scarlet> wonder if mtv will do a mj vid special
[01:40] <Acosta> in fact know little of his life
[01:40] <bjork-wtf> ghst> huh?
[01:40] <Shinobi_EuroU21> all I know is this
[01:40] <Unison> i thought the song was about her when i was a kid, which was confusing
[01:40] <DrForester> man, crowd at hospital is nuts
[01:40] <Acosta> but I grew listening his music, I really loved
[01:40] <Acosta> so I feel sad
[01:40] <Kab_Laptop> I hope they become the MJ channel for a month or two Scarlet
[01:40] <Shinobi_EuroU21> jacko's one of the greatest musicians of all time
[01:40] <Kab_Laptop> That'd be a HUGE improvement
[01:40] <Shinobi_EuroU21> everything else is background noise
[01:40] <Kab_Laptop> Everything else?
[01:40] <Shinobi_EuroU21> yeah
[01:40] <EGM92> I can see them playing "BEAT IT" while they lower the coffin into the ground :(
[01:40] <Shinobi_EuroU21> now if you believe he is a pedo then ok, maybe that makes things different
[01:40] <Lo-Volt> I'm not personally 'shattered,' but it's regrettable that he died relatively young after the last few years of his life were genuinely distressed.
[01:40] <Kab_Laptop> It does yeah Shinobi_EuroU21
[01:40] <Shinobi_EuroU21> but he's never fit the pedo profile
[01:40] <Lo-Volt> I just think it's a bit sad...
[01:40] <Unison> CNN, TELL ME HOW TO FEEL ABOUT THIS TRAGEDY!
[01:41] <syllogism> "WTF? How does a wealthy person die at age 50?"
[01:41] <ghst> i love that the bbc cant call it tmzee without correcting themselves after
[01:41] <Kab_Laptop> Killing yourself usually does the trick
[01:41] <Wes_> The AP wire are saying he's dead.
[01:41] <Shinobi_EuroU21> and honestly, if jacko was such an obvious pedo, he wouldn't have beaten TWO seperate cases
[01:41] <OrinX> what did he die of by the way
[01:41] <Tiduz> he finally got rest now
[01:41] <Shinobi_EuroU21> Christ, even OJ didn't skate twice
[01:41] <Tiduz> which he didnt when he was alive
[01:41] <Unison> too bad it wasn't Michael Bay :((
[01:41] <bjork-wtf> shin is right

[01:53] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> great riff
[01:53] <GaimeGuy> nonstop
[01:53] <OrinX> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUDV7Q-8dfc  South PARK TELLS THE TRUTH
[01:53] <Gattsu25> other than that...not much else to say
[01:53] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> video was awesome
[01:53] <OrinX> Sure he touched some children
[01:53] <OrinX> but hes michael jackson
[01:53] <Gattsu25> I liked his music but...meh.
[01:53] <Gattsu25> People die everyday
[01:53] <Unison> meh?
[01:53] <Unison> haha true
[01:53] <OrinX> MICHAEL JACKSON EVRYBODY
[01:53] <Nikashi> He if he touched kids it was just to see if his was bigger
[01:53] <Sea_Manky> No, Annie, he is not okay.
[01:53] <Nikashi> that's all

[01:54] <GaimeGuy> Long live the king ;_;
[01:54] <Unison> i am more sad about the lack of future wacko jacko updates than future music at this point
[01:54] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> haha
[01:54] <Acosta> lol kab
[01:54] <Unison> which is awful, but that's what he became
[01:54] <minty> oh sweet. nba draft tonight
[01:54] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> I just wanted jacko to have one more great string of shows
[01:54] <Gattsu25> I dunno
[01:54] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> so he could go out with a bang
[01:54] <Acosta> I actually refrained of saying something like that
[01:54] <Kab_Laptop> Nobody gives a shit if an accountant dies, this is one of the greatest music stars of all-time we're talking about
[01:54] <Kab_Laptop> Of course this matters more
[01:54] <GaimeGuy> I can tell you what the wolves won't do
[01:54] <Gattsu25> I would have been more affected had this news come at a different time in my life
[01:54] <Unison> well
[01:54] <DrForester> ROFL
[01:54] <DrForester> http://i137.photobucket.com/albums/q239/Ezduo/wut.jpg
[01:54] <GaimeGuy> nothing
[01:54] <bjork-wtf> I would've gone to see MJ
[01:54] <Unison> "all-time" = our lives
[01:54] <Unison> let's have some perspective
[01:54] <bjork-wtf> and probably marked out more than I did for (/v\)
[01:55] <Kab_Laptop> Definitely all-time Unison
[01:55] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> people don't realize how ridiculously influential jacko's been in music the last 30 years
[01:55] <ghst> so, the most famous celebrity in the world is dead. who's next?
[01:55] <Gattsu25> My brother just survived a dangerous surgery and has survived cancer, not even a week and a half ago
[01:55] <Kab_Laptop> He's absolutely in the top 50 of all-time
[01:55] <Gattsu25> really puts things in perspective
[01:55] <bjork-wtf> without MJ, weird al would've lacked his bigger hits
[01:55] <Unison> haha bjork
[01:55] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> hahaha
[01:55] <GaimeGuy> no t hey don't ,shin
[01:55] <Nikashi> Unison 
[01:55] <Nikashi> are you at home
[01:55] <Gattsu25> MJ is a great artist
[01:55] <Unison> yes
[01:55] <GaimeGuy> he made the music video important, really
[01:55] <Nikashi> let's fight
[01:55] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> there's your perspective gattsu!
[01:55] <Unison> lol no way
[01:55] <Nikashi> SFIV
[01:55] <Nikashi> why not
[01:55] <Unison> internet is fucked now
[01:55] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> no jacko = no weird al!
[01:55] <Gattsu25> his shit when he was in the Jackson 5 is his hidden treasure
[01:56] <Tiduz> Gattsu25
[01:56] <Unison> everyone's getting jacko news
[01:56] <Kab_Laptop> Good to hear he survived all that Gattsu25, never mind me then.
[01:56] <Tiduz> hes cured of cancer now ?
[01:56] <Nikashi> Unison : Haha, ok
[01:56] <Tiduz> i remember your story

[01:56] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> and cnn will still be waiting to confirm
[01:56] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> even as the hearse is being driven away
[01:56] <GaimeGuy> and that's not even looking at the music itself
[01:56] <Gattsu25> yeah, he made it...just has to get checked up every few months for the rest of his life
[01:57] <OrinX> AND WHEN U COME BACK U WILL SEE HES STILL ALIVE
[01:57] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> thriller!!
[01:57] <Gattsu25> to make sure it doesn't come back
[01:57] <OrinX> god  speed shin
[01:57] <GaimeGuy> you have the performances, the music videos, and pop 
[01:57] <Unison> shin, they realized they could steal the music video market
[01:57] <Unison> now that MTV doesnt play them
[01:57] <Nikashi> So T-minus how long till his daughter is legal and fucked up
[01:57] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> LOL
[01:57] <Unison> so they are gonna milk this shit
[01:57] <jett> i don't think cnn realizes how tasteless it is to show MJ as a zombie
[01:57] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> cnn's almost as genius as jacko himself
[01:57] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> haha jett
[01:57] <Unison> hahaha jet
[01:57] <GaimeGuy> lol
[01:57] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> thriller = GOAT

[01:57] <DrForester> SHUT THE FUCK UP WOLF BLITZER SHOW THRILLER
[01:58] <Nikashi> you can't show a man as a zombie right after he dies lol
[01:58] <OrinX> did they say what killed him exactly?

[01:58] <GaimeGuy> cardiac arrest
[01:58] <Nikashi> wow

[02:00] <GaimeGuy> *necrotizing
[02:00] * minty slaps OrinX around a bit with a large trout
[02:00] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> ok, I'm out
[02:00] <bjork-wtf> only thing bigger than MJ dying would be if CNN broke a story that Obama fingered Dakota Fanning or something
[02:00] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> bbl
[02:00] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> lulz
[02:00] <minty> seriously, that wasn't cool
[02:00] <Nikashi> I'd make jokes about him not even being cold yet
[02:00] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> Obama: The new Jacko?
[02:00] <Nikashi> but he was cold years ago
[02:00] <DrForester> Oh shit
[02:00] <DrForester> CNN backpeddling, 
[02:00] <OrinX> too soon nik
[02:00] <OrinX> get out!
[02:01] <DrForester> CNN:  "We can no longer confirm he's dead"
[02:01] <OrinX> CNN says hes alive and well
[02:01] <minty> uhoh
[02:01] <bjork-wtf> maybe he saw a long tunnel with a light at the end
[02:01] <bjork-wtf> and god was like
[02:01] <Unison> zombie video was right
[02:01] <Kab_Laptop> This is too boring, fuck you CNN, going to bed.
[02:01] <bjork-wtf> "jesus, or you?" and MJ moonwalked
[02:01] <Unison> "die hard fans" can't compare to MJ
[02:01] <ghst> he was dead but he's getting better - 10,000 new tickets available!
[02:01] <bjork-wtf> and god said "goddamn"
[02:01] <Unison> he dies harder
[02:02] <Nikashi> MJ Dies; Gets Better
[02:02] <Unison> they are interviewing his stalkers
[02:02] <DrForester> CNN lady jsut said "people pulling out their Blacks-berries"
[02:02] <Unison> racist!
[02:02] <OrinX> blacks berries
[02:02] <OrinX> haha
[02:02] <Lo-Volt> It'd be really awkward if CNN's hedging ends up being the right thing. Pretty much every other big news agency would be supremely embarrassed.
[02:02] <GaimeGuy> lol
[02:02] <GaimeGuy> haha lo
[02:02] <EGM92> may I be the first one to say that MJ has faked his death
[02:02] <Lo-Volt> You're not, by the way.
[02:02] <bjork-wtf> no
[02:02] <Scarlet> nikashi already did
[02:02] <OrinX> no
[02:02] <GaimeGuy> as a publicity stunt for Thriller 2
[02:02] <bjork-wtf> it was said a long time ago
[02:02] <EGM92> and is now on his way to the island of LOST to join Biggie and Tupac
[02:02] <Nikashi> Old
[02:02] <GaimeGuy> ;P
[02:02] <minty> i said it even b4 nick did!
[02:03] <Unison> liz taylor didnt twitter about it
[02:03] <Nikashi> He faked his death 10 years ago but forgot he had to stop showing up at places
[02:03] <bjork-wtf> [15:11] <bjork-wtf> maybe it's an elvis faked death! /weeklyworldnews
[02:03] <Sea_Manky> man, I hope the power doesn't go out before I finish cooking dinner
[02:03] <bjork-wtf> catch up EGMuz
[02:03] <Sea_Manky> although the worst of the storm seems to have passed

[02:39] <jakehk> annnd blake griffins career is over
[02:40] <fallout> BJ: well, it was supposed to be the stand-in singer
[02:40] <fallout> The Simpsons commentary tracks are so good

[02:41] <fallout> EviLore: what'd we do now?
[02:41] <ghst> competing with the overbearing 80% twitter reign of "i'm taking a dump" 
[02:41] <GaimeGuy> we killed MJ
[02:41] <bjork-wtf> what was the ultimatum?
[02:42] <DrForester> Gaime, Iranian president killed MJ to get revolution off news
[02:42] <EviLore> debate thread about MJ, to keep the conversation out of the RIP thread.  everyone shat on it, I said it was staying open to direct the conversation there and that people whining about the thread would be banned

[02:43] <DrForester> The scandal is part of MJ's legacy, like it or not
[02:43] <GaimeGuy> what's there to debate?
[02:43] <DrForester> Like I said before, OJ's death isn't going to bring out fond memories of his football days
[02:43] <EviLore> someone even said "this is going to be locked" afterwards
[02:43] <etoilet> probablt debate about MJ's character and pedopbelia
[02:43] <Acosta> again DrForester, his life has nothing to do with his legacy
[02:43] <EviLore> after I say "IT'S STAYING OPEN"
[02:43] <Acosta> don't compare for god's shake
[02:43] <DrForester> a persons life IS their legacy....

[02:43] <jakehk> acosta
[02:43] <jakehk> whats spain sayin about losin today

[02:44] <fallout> EviLore: yeah, most people aren't very good at the whole reading thing
[02:44] <Acosta> and his life will be buried with him

[06:01] * EGM92 slaps Armitage around a bit with a large trout
[06:01] <EGM92> MJ will never really die
[06:01] <darkh23> MJ has top 13 spots on amazon music sales
[06:02] <Armitage> he's been reborn
[06:02] <EGM92> they're going to melt him down and make a plastic mold of himself.
[06:02] <Tiduz> WOW
[06:02] <Tiduz> ''A bus full of tourists thought they were driving up a fancy street to look at Michael Jackson's front gate. Instead, they witnessed the last moments of Michael Jackson's life.''
[06:02] <olubode> Arm: Jaylah is going to get plenty of Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad, Dangerous and yes...even some Invincible (which was still a good albulm)
[06:02] <SeraphicHeat> REBORN
[06:03] <olubode> darkh23: thats nothing, Michael Jackson Torrents have brought down the internet in Spain...SPAIN!
[06:03] <Lo-Volt> Invincible had some very pleasant moments.
[06:03] <olubode> ;)
[06:03] <Armitage> nice
[06:03] <darkh23> lol
[06:03] <olubode> Lo-Volt: tell me about it. 
[06:03] * soakrates has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[06:04] <Lo-Volt> I have to find the record, but one single was actually very nice to the ears.
[06:04] <olubode> I hope that Michael Jackson song that like We Are the World part 2 gets released now. Both the english and spanish version
[06:04] <Lo-Volt> "Butterflies" was it?
[06:04] <olubode> yup
[06:04] <olubode> that track was fantastic
[06:04] <Unison> butterflies came out on Invincible
[06:04] <Unison> you are thinking of that katrina song
[06:04] <olubode> no
[06:04] <Lo-Volt> No, I meant Butterflies.
[06:04] <olubode> Unison: two different topics
[06:04] <Unison> oh lolz
[06:04] <Tony_Parker> Floetry's song he stole!
[06:05] <olubode> I'm agreeing with Lo-Volt
[06:05] <olubode> Tony: really?
[06:05] <olubode> I didn't know that
[06:05] <Tony_Parker> yes
[06:05] <Lo-Volt> He stole it?
[06:05] <Tony_Parker> yeah
[06:05] <Lo-Volt> Which is regrettable if so, since he did write some of his own songs.
[06:05] <olubode> I can believe that was a Florety song.
[06:05] <olubode> that said
[06:05] <olubode> MJ kills it
[06:05] <Lo-Volt> It felt like old Michael Jackson.
[06:06] <olubode> especially when he goes into his falsetto on the second verse
[06:06] <jett> this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOdGGe7eVqE
[06:06] <Somnia> jackson has taken over itunes album sales also
[06:06] <olubode> jett...yup!
[06:06] <Lo-Volt> As opposed to the desperate nature of songs like "Scream."
[06:06] <Lo-Volt> It was just... nice.
[06:06] <Tony_Parker> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterflies_(Michael_Jackson_song)
[06:08] <Unison> that album was awful imo
[06:08] <Unison> i am sorry
[06:08] <Lo-Volt> I love that chorus.
[06:08] <Unison> for all the hype it had
[06:08] <Unison> it was fucking shit
[06:08] <Lo-Volt> Inside, inside, inside...
[06:08] <DrForester> ....
[06:08] <Unison> $30 million it cost to record
[06:08] <Unison> haha
[06:08] <DrForester> Did I jus thear Optimus prime doing a Coors light comercial?
[06:08] <olubode> Just make my dream come true!!!
[06:08] <Lo-Volt> Don't get me wrong, a lot of the album was... bloated.
[06:08] <olubode> that falsetto gets my back shivering.
[06:08] <Unison> it's DEFINITELY his worst
[06:08] <Lo-Volt> Like a lot of Jackson's 1990s material. But...
[06:08] <olubode> that said, Tony: thanks for the info.
[06:09] <Lo-Volt> Was "Butterflies" released in the spring or summer?
[06:09] <olubode> no, HIStory was worse than Invincible imho
[06:09] <Unison> no way
[06:09] <Somnia> fuck it bought the essential album
[06:09] <Unison> Stranger in Moscow
[06:09] <Unison> > anything on Invincible
[06:09] <Lo-Volt> What's wrong with that song?
[06:09] <GaimeGuy> I liked Will You Be There
[06:09] <Unison> yes
[06:09] <Unison> also urrm 
[06:09] <jett> the butterflies song sounds pretty nice
[06:09] <olubode> Lo-Volt: Wikipedia says November
[06:09] <Lo-Volt> Someone get me a knife, I'ma cut Unison.
[06:09] <jett> sounds like old jamiroquai 
[06:09] <GaimeGuy> One of my favorite songs of his from the 90s
[06:09] <Lo-Volt> Damn, really? That song reminds me of warm weather.
[06:10] <Somnia> so who does the money from all of these album sales go to? other than the studios obviously
[06:10] <darkh23> altogetherandrews trying to shit on the MJ thread.....dude is like the eternal grouch
[06:10] <Unison> You are not alone too
[06:10] <Unison> great song
[06:10] <Unison> that album DESTROYS Invincible
[06:10] <Tony_Parker> nobody remembers that MJ tribute album released late last year
[06:10] <Unison> frankly
[06:10] <Tony_Parker> where the BEP remade some song
[06:10] <Unison> that was teh thriller reissue?
[06:10] <olubode> Tony_Parker: I don't think you can say that MJ stole the song if a version of the song is out there with BOTH MJ and Floetry
[06:10] <Tony_Parker> i think
[06:11] <Unison> the new tracks on that were horrenouds
[06:11] <olubode> seems they got paid
[06:11] <Tony_Parker> it was a blend!
[06:11] <Unison> i will not abuse MJ's legacy by praising his subpar efforts
[06:11] <Tony_Parker> yeah they got paid
[06:12] <olubode> Somnia: so who does the money from all of these album sales go to? other than the studios obviously <--- Why do you think MJ Called Tony whatshisname the devil?
[06:12] <Somnia> =/
[06:12] <Unison> maybe the 50 tracks he recorded for his comeback album will actually come out now
[06:12] * Diablos has quit IRC (Quit: )
[06:12] <olubode> yes

[06:49] <Somnia> I dont know what they were thinking
[06:49] <Tony_Parker> everybody trying to trade to beat the Spurs
[06:50] <Tiduz> they already had the jack artefact

[07:05] <bluemax> i think mj is faking his death
[07:05] <bluemax> to escape the limelight
[07:05] <thesoapster> 2pac style
[07:05] <fallout> that was always the big thing surrounding the tupac rumours
[07:06] <fallout> made more money dead
[07:06] <Somnia> I wonder if anyone recorded him practicing his tour at the staples center last night
[07:06] <Tiduz> jesus thr
[07:06] <Tiduz> thesoapster *
[07:06] <Tony_Parker> last pick!

[07:07] <thesoapster> their insurance company totaled it right off the bat.
[07:07] <thesoapster> speaking of which that case recently settled 
[07:07] <Tiduz> dayum
[07:07] <thesoapster> if that kid's insurance wasn't high risk enough..
[07:08] <thesoapster> they paid me ~9k for my bike 
[07:08] <thesoapster> and they settled for 50k (minus bills and lawyer fee i'll have about 28k)
[07:08] <thesoapster> so. he is going to be riding a bicycle or riding with mommy and daddy for a while.

[07:12] <thesoapster> i, along with 4 others i'm leading
[07:12] <thesoapster> have to migrate 600 pop accounts to exchange
[07:12] <thesoapster> YES
[07:12] <minty> ;o
[07:12] <bluemax> that sucks dude
[07:12] <bluemax> ive done that before
[07:12] <thesoapster> nah it doesn't take too much time
[07:12] <minty> IT folks have to do some real work now!
[07:12] <bluemax> and it suuuuuucks
[07:12] <thesoapster> i've already done a bunch :p
[07:12] <bluemax> it still sucks
[07:12] <bluemax> i hate working with peoples email
[07:12] <thesoapster> i had to write the documentation up etc
[07:12] <thesoapster> that's a huge part of my job
[07:12] <bluemax> we had people who hadnt deleted shit
[07:12] <bluemax> in 5 years
[07:13] <thesoapster> oh yeah
[07:13] <thesoapster> of course
[07:13] <minty> lol
[07:13] <thesoapster> 4gig psts and shit
[07:13] <bluemax> yeah
[07:13] <bluemax> exporting it took hours
[07:13] <thesoapster> that's when you take the keyboard away from them and smack them
[07:13] <thesoapster> and then lose your job
[07:13] <bluemax> ha
[07:13] <bluemax> yeah ugh
[07:13] <thesoapster> most of this is being pulled from eudora.
[07:13] <thesoapster> eudora > outlook
[07:13] <bluemax> people still use eudora?
[07:14] <thesoapster> or, if they fight and want to keep eudora 
[07:14] <thesoapster> YES
[07:14] <thesoapster> all the old fuckers
[07:14] <thesoapster> which there are a lot of
[07:14] <bluemax> ha
[07:14] <bluemax> i remember that from when i started doing it in 2002
[07:14] <thesoapster> they can pop with eudora to the exchange server
[07:14] <bluemax> but at my second job almost no one used it
[07:14] <minty> omg eudora
[07:14] <thesoapster> but we discourage that and try to tell them outlook will make their wildest dreams come true (dreams of calendars and GALs etc)
[07:14] <thesoapster> i fucking hate eudora
[07:15] <thesoapster> the only semi nice thing about it is that most of the installs/data folders are on and the same
[07:15] <thesoapster> so if you move/copy it, it's all there and intact 
[07:15] <thesoapster> otherwise i hate it
[07:15] <bluemax> yeah
[07:15] <bluemax> its so shit
[07:15] <thesoapster> it's not supported anymore
[07:15] <thesoapster> i always make sure to bring that up
[07:15] <thesoapster> and tell them qualcomm went under 
[07:15] <thesoapster> but of course they know ms is around :p
[07:16] <thesoapster> the stupid thing is the exchange server they're being put on is increasingly playing less and less nice with eudora
[07:16] <thesoapster> yet they (hhs/nih) have not mandated that they switch
[07:16] <thesoapster> probably would be an old people revolt.

[07:23] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> hey, the usa beat brazil in the '97 confederations cup
[07:23] <soakrates> the last one was the only one that actually made it to trial I believe
[07:23] <Rorschach> nope... the first one was the one that had the penis sketches
[07:23] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> sometimes, shit happens

[08:24] * Katana has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[08:24] <bjork-wtf> no, he killed that thread
[08:24] <Hitokage> tetris is one of the few games you play with your subconscious
[08:24] <bjork-wtf> it was on a roll too
[08:24] <Hitokage> but mine doesn't like it for long
[08:24] <Armitage> [22:23] <bjork-wtf> arm> wat about - a short film
[08:25] <Armitage> gaf's favorite subject
[08:25] <Armitage> sure to be a 10+ pager
[08:25] <Rorschach> close you eyes, Hitokage
[08:25] <Rorschach> do you see falling pieces?
[08:25] <bjork-wtf> sorry arm
[08:25] <bjork-wtf> I made it like 2:00 in
[08:25] <Scarlet> play the invisible tetris
[08:25] <bjork-wtf> can't do it
[08:25] <SeraphicHeat> You dream big Armi
[08:25] <Hitokage> Rorschach: dunno
[08:25] * Katana_ has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[08:26] <Hitokage> it's still going on in my head, if that's what you mean, but not really visually
[08:27] <Rorschach> when I play puzzle games too long, I get the Tetris effect.  Last week, I had Hexic in my head whenever I closed my eyes to go to sleep. :|
[08:27] <Armitage> bjork
[08:27] <Armitage> my topic is called "please say somethin"
[08:27] <Armitage> i just realized the irony
[08:27] <Rorschach> yeah, sometimes I'd be "flipping" pieces, but I wouldn't actually see them
[08:28] <jman2050> man, why do all the wacky-jappy RPGs have the best battle systems
[08:28] * bjork-wtf <3 hexic
[08:29] <Hitokage> playing TGM Shirase mode (infinite drop speed with quick lock/reload timings) has me place things almost on pure mental reflex :(
[08:29] <jakehk> wtf happened to gamersyde
[08:29] <jman2050> it makes playing them an exercise in cognitive dissonance
[08:31] <Hitokage> hate it when a piece gets stuck where I don't expect it and my entire train of thought gets derailed making the whole screen look like gibberish for a second
[08:32] <Rorschach> Hitokage: too hardcore for me.  When it starts getting really up there in speed, I'm out!
[08:32] <Rorschach> you have to look at what pieces are coming, what piece to save, how to place them
[08:32] <Rorschach> aaaaag
[08:32] <bjork-wtf> I miss that one disney tetris on N64 where there could be gigantic pieces
[08:33] <Hitokage> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_UwvOpaaE <- what I'm talking about, but using a clone without the annoying sound effects
[08:33] <Rorschach> yeah, I know 
[08:33] <Hitokage> ...and I do not play anywhere near that well

[08:34] <Hitokage> my record so far is 145
[08:34] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> bet the moonwalker arcade game is the most downloaded arcade rom of the next week
[08:34] <Hitokage> in that mode
[08:34] <Hitokage> which is like 40 seconds into that vid

[08:36] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> haha bjork
[08:36] <Shinobi_RIPJacko> it shat on the genesis game
[08:37] <Rorschach> yeah, there are less things to focus on at once
[08:37] <Hitokage> drop speed is the same, but the timings are much much more forgiving
[08:37] <bjork-wtf> hito> what's up with the blocks turning to zeros?
[08:38] <Hitokage> I think after a point the pieces turn black and white ASCII
[08:38] <jakehk> 6  England 1225 1  52 
[08:38] <jakehk> 7  Argentina 1203 -1  8

[08:20] <Nikashi> Did he give you that link for TGM 2
[08:21] <Hitokage> which is basically TGM2 TA Death Mode
[08:21] <Nikashi> the special TGM 2 version of Mame I mean
[08:21] <Hitokage> is it windows only?
[08:22] <Nikashi> um
[08:22] <Nikashi> you'd have to ask him that, he did direct me to the windows exe though
[08:22] <Nikashi> It's basically just tuned to eliminate the input lag on the regular mame
[08:22] <Nikashi> what OS are you using mainly
[08:22] <Hitokage> I actually don't care for TGM sound effects
[08:23] <Hitokage> mac
[08:24] <Nikashi> Hrm, can't seem to find a mac port but lee might

[08:59] <Scarlet> you aint doing anything, i invite, you ignore, then you play that game instead and it doesnt work..yeah
[08:59] * Scarlet curse dh
[08:59] <darkh23> when something is broke I must fix it
[08:59] <Scarlet> but you didnt know it was broke yet
[08:59] <darkh23> yeah I've known it was broke for like a week now
[09:00] <Scarlet> no
[09:00] <darkh23> yes
[09:01] <Scarlet> lies

[09:02] <Scarlet> ill remember your shrugg off!
[09:03] <bluemax> you dont want to get on her bad side
[09:03] <darkh23> eh I've been delaying games with scarlet for 15 years now
[09:04] <darkh23> we once decided to race in zelda
[09:04] <darkh23> I gave up when she was like 5 dungeons ahead
[09:05] <Scarlet> i dont remember that
[09:05] <Scarlet> i just remember yoshis island
[09:05] <Scarlet> was it zelda 1?
[09:05] <Scarlet> or 3
[09:06] <darkh23> 1
[09:06] <Scarlet> and you got dq3 but just bought it to taunt
[09:06] <Scarlet> cool
[09:06] <darkh23> haha
[09:06] <Scarlet> dh has my yoshis island
[09:06] <Scarlet> i could play it again now, i forgot all about it

[11:49] <Firestorm> and it wasn't very good
[11:49] <Firestorm> i need some good poutine
[11:52] <Nikashi> New York Fries or A&W has the best
[11:52] <Nikashi> New York Fries is what I'd recommend myself, but if you got to A&W ask for the poutine to be served on a plate
[11:52] <Nikashi> you'll get more
[11:52] <Scarlet> a&w onion rings
[11:52] <Nikashi> Those are good too
[11:52] <Nikashi> I've made thousands personally heh
[11:52] <Scarlet> mozza burgerrrrr
[11:53] <Nikashi> Scarlet I thought A&Ws were extinct in the US
[11:53] <Scarlet> the only ones i know about are in the state im at
[11:53] <Scarlet> the one here, my mom worked at in the 70s
[11:53] <Scarlet> or so
[11:53] <Scarlet> or late 60s
[11:53] <Nikashi> My mom was a carhop back in the day

[11:54] <Scarlet> probably since ive heard of them
[11:54] <Nikashi> they have Papa, Mama, Teen, Baby, Granpa, and Uncle burgers here
[11:54] <Nikashi> Uncle is a new one
[11:54] <Nikashi> it's Sirloin
[11:55] <Scarlet> im pretty sure i have no clue what im doing and am playing dmc3 completely wrong..
[11:57] <KimiMoon> Illegitimate Offspring Burger
[11:57] * KimiMoon is now known as KimiNewt
[11:58] <Firestorm> i don't like ny fries poutine too much
[11:58] <Firestorm> a&w is decent but it's still fast food
[11:58] <Firestorm> needs me some real stuff. never had any.
[11:58] <Scarlet> their cheese curds are pretty good
[11:58] <KimiNewt> I totally need a burger now. Dammit.
[11:58] <Scarlet> can you buy the root beer in gallon cartons nik?
[11:59] <KimiNewt> I could get a really good one, maybe even a cheeseburger but for that I'm gonna have to go out with friends
[11:59] <Nikashi> cartons?
[11:59] <Nikashi> no
[11:59] <Nikashi> just 2L bottles
[11:59] <Nikashi> but you can buy it at most stores 
[11:59] <KimiNewt> Or I could just get a lame McDonald's or BurgerRanch one
[11:59] <Scarlet> 1 gallon jug
[11:59] <Nikashi> A&W is sold everywhere in stores here
[11:59] <Scarlet> yeah but its supposedly better from the restaraunt
[11:59] <Scarlet> i dont drink much rb so no idea
[12:00] <Nikashi> It's best draft in a frosted mug
[12:00] <Nikashi> period
[12:00] <Scarlet> yeah they do that, or the float
[12:00] <Scarlet> i like the creme soda sporadically
[12:00] <Firestorm> wtf 4L cartons of pop at a & w?
[12:00] <Scarlet> i dont think theres much a&w rb for sale on the east coast
[12:00] <Firestorm> I remember when we went down to the states my friends went into a supermarket and came out with 4L cartons of pop
[12:00] <Firestorm> it was magical
[12:00] <Nikashi> They have a deal with Coa Cola up here
[12:00] <Nikashi> coca cola
[12:01] <Nikashi> Coca Cola bottles it and sells it for them
[12:01] <Nikashi> but it's A&W 
[12:01] <Firestorm> Yeah
[12:01] <Nikashi> but they're not owned by Coke at all
[12:01] <Firestorm> I think it might be Pepsi actually
[12:01] <Nikashi> No it's coke
[12:01] <Firestorm> really?
[12:01] <Firestorm> hm
[12:01] <Nikashi> Pepsi makes Mug which it sees as a direct competitor
[12:01] <Firestorm> Ahh yeah
[12:01] <Nikashi> Coke makes Barq's which is a different kind of root beer
[12:01] <Firestorm> Yeah
[12:01] <Nikashi> And is also kind of like A&W
[12:01] <Firestorm> Ithought Barqs was their root bear
[12:01] <Nikashi> in that it used to be a seperate company
[12:01] <Nikashi> nope
[12:01] <Firestorm> but guess it'sboth
[12:01] <Nikashi> Coke doesn't have a Root Beer really
[12:02] <Firestorm> I just know Everything for a Dollar Store has Barqs and they're Coke only
[12:02] <Firestorm> <3 EFADS

[15:18] <syllogism> it's a much bigger project than say World of goo though
[15:18] <Kabouter> €30 is a joke, that's what major retail games cost
[15:18] <Kabouter> Sure
[15:19] <Kabouter> But it is still in no way the same value as a full price game imho
[15:19] * Reno- has joined #GA
[15:19] <syllogism> why not, most games are like 8h these days
[15:19] <syllogism> do we pay based on the budget or what
[15:20] <Kabouter> I pay based on perceived value
[15:20] <Kabouter> I perceive Trine's value to be about $15
[15:21] <syllogism> that's fair if you perceive like Halo 3 single player to be about $15
[15:21] <syllogism> or gears :P
[15:21] <Kabouter> I don't
[15:21] <Kabouter> Halo 3 single-player to me was worth about $5
[15:22] <Kabouter> Which is good because I got Halo 3 for free with 13 months XBL
[15:22] <syllogism> I should stop listening to these TTC lectures while doing other stuff, I miss like 90%

[15:26] <Kabouter> 9.5% unemployment in the EU
[15:26] <Kabouter> Err Eurozone
[15:27] <Kabouter> Compared to 9.4% in the US and 5.2% in Japan
[15:27] <Kabouter> Highest Eurozone unemployment is still Spain with 18.7%, Netherlands lowest with 3.2%
[15:28] <Kabouter> Germany has 7.7%, France 9.3%
[15:30] <syllogism> 9.6 in the US
[15:30] <syllogism> ..probably
[15:30] <syllogism> the report isnt out yet
[15:32] <Kabouter> Ah
[15:32] <Kabouter> It's all fake numbers anyway
[15:32] <Kabouter> our real unemployment is over 4 now
[15:32] <Kabouter> Can only imagine how high Spain's really is :X
[15:33] <syllogism> of course "real" unemployment in the US is much higher too
[15:34] <Kabouter> True
[15:34] <Kabouter> And yes, real isn't a completely fair term :P. But it's close enough to the truth that I'm gonna stick with it.

[16:05] <syllogism> NOT ENOUGH AARRGJH

[16:06] <syllogism> it's not just him
[16:07] <syllogism> or just gaf
[16:08] <Hitokage> I try not to think about that
[16:09] * EGM92 has joined #GA
[16:09] <stump-work> I loved when Gaborn has to repeatedly reconcile his love for the Republican party and his being gay, which always results in some contortion of "No rights are better than some rights! At least Republicans are consistent! Boy the Democrats suck!"
[16:10] <Hitokage> he's not conservative either
[16:10] <Hitokage> he's libertarian on the order of slightly less insane than JayDubya
[16:11] <syllogism> jaydubya seems like a conservative who pretends to be libertarian
[16:11] <Hitokage> only because of his obsession with abortion
[16:11] <duckroll> wiw
[16:12] <duckroll> india decriminalized homosexuality?
[16:12] <duckroll> wow
[16:12] <stump-work> Yep.
[16:12] <duckroll> as in
[16:12] <duckroll> sodomy is no longer a crime?
[16:12] <stump-work> Actually, it wasn't just sodomy.
[16:12] <duckroll> well im just curious about sodomy in particular
[16:12] <BJ> mmm sodomy
[16:12] <stump-work> Homosexual intercourse, male or female, was punishable by up to 10 years. Now it's not punishable at all.
[16:12] <Hitokage> remember, JayDubya insists that it is always immortal to actively kill people rather than letting a much larger number of people die through inaction
[16:12] <Hitokage> er
[16:12] <Hitokage> immoral
[16:12] <duckroll> man
[16:12] <duckroll> singapore is still behind on that
[16:13] <duckroll> there was an appeal to remove the law
[16:13] <duckroll> but instead they decriminalized sodomy for consenting hetrosexuals (anal intercourse) but kept the homosexual part of the law intact
[16:13] <duckroll> lolz
[16:13] <duckroll> that was last year i think
[16:13] <stump-work> I wouldn't live in a country that didn't have gay marriage. I don't think I'd even consider visiting a country that still criminalized homosexuality.
[16:14] <duckroll> well
[16:14] <duckroll> i think its naive to see it that way
[16:14] <duckroll> homosexuals exist in Singapore
[16:14] <duckroll> its not like they are prosecuted
[16:14] <duckroll> the legal status is more....... social political
[16:14] <duckroll> rather than anything else
[16:15] <syllogism> singapore is one of the axis of evil countries really
[16:15] <duckroll> conservative leaning society, etc
[16:15] <stump-work> It's irrelevant to me; a country that doesn't treat humans as humans, whether de jure or de facto or just socially, is not a country I want to go to.
[16:15] <duckroll> well i guess you probably won't do much travelling!
[16:15] <Hitokage> better move to canada
[16:16] <Hitokage> or something
[16:17] <syllogism> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_rights_by_country
[16:17] <syllogism> seems like he can travel plenty
[16:17] <syllogism> singapore ~ africa
[16:17] <stump-work> Yep. Just not to the african shitholes that would execute homosexuals.
[16:17] * SeraphicHeat has joined #GA
[16:18] <duckroll> well
[16:18] <duckroll> i think we're talking about different things then
[16:18] <duckroll> im not talking about countries which prosecute homosexuality
[16:18] <Reno-> duckroll should come here for gay love
[16:18] <Reno-> i will protect him
[16:18] <Reno-> <3
[16:19] <stump-work> duckroll: I wouldn't visit any country that has a law on the books that would jail or fine a homosexual for consentual sex, even if that law is rarely if ever enforced.
[16:19] <stump-work> So that knocks out most of Africa and the middle east and a decent chunk of south-east Asia.
[16:20] <duckroll> human rights are overrated honestly
[16:20] <duckroll> us humans don't really deserve many rights
[16:20] <Tre`> Reno-:  Flowchart noels doing my head in
[16:20] <Reno-> leran how to block
[16:20] <Tre`> FFFFUUUUU
[16:20] <Reno-> and how can you complain when you use v-13
[16:20] <Reno-> seriously
[16:20] <Reno-> you can't complain!
[16:20] <Tre`> dude, I had to learn combos and shit
[16:21] <Reno-> don't matter!
[16:21] <Tre`> these noel players are just mashing!
[16:21] <Reno-> v-13/arakune users = not allowed to complain
[16:21] <Reno-> use Tager on Noel mashers lol
[16:21] <Reno-> that shit is just lawl
[16:21] <Tre`> they're not even doing combos!
[16:21] <Tre`> jump in C, mash chain revolver
[16:21] <Reno-> you will lawl if you use tager dude
[16:21] <Tre`> why does that shit have some invincibility
[16:21] <Reno-> do qcf+B on a masher noel
[16:21] <Reno-> it has super armor against projectiles
[16:21] <Reno-> and if it hits
[16:22] <Reno-> free 360
[16:22] <Reno-> it's 45% off
[16:22] <Tre`> but then I'd have to play tager
[16:22] <FnordChan> I played a few rounds of BlazBlue online last night to show off my button mashing Jin skills.  It was pretty embarassing, but fortunately lag gave me an excuse to bow out after three humiliating rounds.
[16:22] <Tre`> I did figure out like 30% tager combos without even looking shit up though
[16:22] <duckroll> i hear Jin's a dick
[16:22] <duckroll> is it true?
[16:22] <Tre`> 3 moves, 30%!
[16:22] <Tre`> Jin has a brother complex
[16:22] <duckroll> haha
[16:22] <duckroll> FnordChan: seen Aoi Hana yet?
[16:22] <Reno-> the funniest thing
[16:22] <Reno-> is v-13 against tager
[16:23] <Reno-> if they miss the swords
[16:23] <Reno-> goodbye 60%
[16:23] <Reno-> lol
[16:23] <Tre`> yeah that's bullshit
[16:23] <Reno-> ain't bullshit
[16:23] <Tre`> tager doesn't need super armor vs. projectiles
[16:23] <Reno-> tager can't even super jump or double jump
[16:23] <Reno-> nigga can't even dash forward
[16:23] <Tre`> sit in your corner and let me DDDDDDDD you
[16:23] <FnordChan> duckroll:  I've seen exactly zilch of the new season.  However, I'm visiting with some old-school anime friends for a weekend in mid-July, and we'll undoubtably sit around and watch the new shows.  How was Aoi Hana?
[16:23] <Tre`> seriously, this noel player was so frustrating
[16:23] <duckroll> good
[16:23] <duckroll> yuri approval
[16:24] <Tre`> and he was like "I think I'm gonna learn another char this weekend"
[16:24] <FnordChan> Jin is totally an asshole.  A keeee-razy asshole.  With cheap moves, which is why I like playing him.
[16:24] <Reno-> dude just learn how to block it
[16:24] <Tre`> and I'm like he hasn't learned this one yet
[16:24] <Reno-> it's easy
[16:24] <FnordChan> duckroll:  Mmmm, yuri.
[16:24] <Reno-> if you see her jump, block high
[16:24] <Reno-> that's it
[16:24] <Reno-> otherwise you block low
[16:24] <duckroll> Ikuhara's OP is pretty good
[16:24] <Tre`> I went into training mode
[16:24] <Tre`> and fucked around with record
[16:24] <duckroll> but he seriously needs to direct his own show again
[16:24] <Tre`> and apparently I can punish the overhead?
[16:24] <Tre`> on block
[16:24] <Reno-> yea
[16:25] <Reno-> you can at the very least get a standing A or 2A
[16:25] <Reno-> with all chars
[16:25] <Tre`> I seriously was trying that shit
[16:25] <Tre`> and then I'd try to hit and get beat out with some other random chain shit
[16:25] <Tre`> like it completely ate my attack like wut
[16:26] <Tre`> it was so frustrating because the guy was so bad and I happened to be worse or something
[16:26] <Tre`> like he didnt block.  anything.
[16:26] <Tre`> and random supers
[16:27] <Reno-> iirc
[16:27] <Reno-> if you don't faultless defense the jumping chain revolver
[16:27] <Reno-> it's a free throw
[16:27] <syllogism> http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/01/AR2009070104217.html?hpid=topnews
[16:28] <Tre`> for them or me
[16:28] <Reno-> i dunno for v-13 though cuz tager has the fastest throw in the game
[16:28] <Tre`> oh
[16:28] <Reno-> for you
[16:28] <Tre`> hmmmm
[16:28] <Tre`> also
[16:28] <Tre`> there was this chain revolver ground crossup that was apparently invincible too
[16:29] <Reno-> ah yeah
[16:30] <Reno-> if you can create space start laying down some stasis fields
[16:30] <Unison_> Tre`: making a road trip funk cd... got some Crusaders, P-funk, Booker T., Afrika Bambaataa, Parliment, Sly & Temptations 
[16:31] <FnordChan> Unison:  That sounds awesome.

[16:31] <Tre`> mmmm statis fields
[16:32] <Tre`> forgot about those outside of combos

[17:44] <Tiduz> Resonance of fate is pretty interesting
[17:45] <Tiduz> you seen that game stump-work ?
[17:45] <stump-work> Plenty of games have had level skip / level select / chapter skip modes, but this is the first time whereby the game would play through stuff for you.

[17:45] <stump-work> Hopefully they pull this one off.

[17:47] <Tiduz> Mods to guns could be interesting too

[17:56] <Kabouter> All that food just looks disgusting to me
[17:56] <Kabouter> I'd probably throw up from the smell too
[17:56] <U_K_Narayan> I don't eat many fried foods, so -- yeah.

[18:05] <OrinX> but picture needs better lighting
[18:05] <OrinX> make it agaqin!
[18:05] <Sea_Manky> Well, I could only eat one
[18:05] <Sea_Manky> The other is in the fridge
[18:05] <Sea_Manky> but I doubt it will look as good today
[18:06] <Sea_Manky> I'll just post it as is
[18:06] <Sea_Manky> okay, posted

[18:07] <FnordChan> Sea_Manky:  What sort of cheese did you use?
[18:07] * HadesGigas has joined #GA
[18:07] <Sea_Manky> Basically, I triple battered the chicken breasts with flour and cayenne pepper and seasoned salt, deep fried then baked them, then melted white cheddar on both sides, added a pound and a half of bacon, and four whole wheat hot dog buns
[18:08] <Sea_Manky> It was fucking awesome
[18:08] <Sea_Manky> But I couldn't eat the second one. :X

[18:09] <Hitokage> by knock me out you mean make me attempt suicide? or actually induce sleep

[18:09] <Hitokage> haha
[18:09] <Sea_Manky> I'm not kidding.
[18:10] <FnordChan> Hitokage:  True, the mascot in Aria is enough to put one over the edge.  Try Yokohama Shopping Log instead, then.  That's snooze worthy and not overly annoying.

[18:33] <EviLore> benjaminbirdie is going mad about this new issue of grant morrison + frank quitely batman.  saying it redefines what an action comic is and that it's the best comic issue of all time.  So I go download it out of curiosity, and.......  uh.......... I think grant morrison has mystical powers over birdie's nether regions
[18:33] <FnordChan> Well, it is Grant Morrison.  That wouldn't surprise me.

[18:52] <Kabouter> Why are people graduating in film studies? I mean, I get it for Unison_, he's already completed everything else.

[18:53] <drain> or they just value it over megabucks

[18:56] <drain> degree may be an indicator of what you are qualified to do
[18:56] <drain> but like I said

[18:58] <Kabouter> In that scenario, it's fine
[18:58] <Unison_> but will probably do phd in English/Rhetoric/Media Studies etc
[18:58] <drain> I guess that was what I was imagining

[19:00] <Unison_> that is true too

[19:00] <Kabouter> Especially now
[19:01] <Unison_> i dont feel bad about getting this degree at all

[20:51] <EviLore> which one
[20:51] <OnkelC> Samsung 9 series
[20:51] <Kabouter> How much is it setting you back exactly anyway OnkelC?
[20:51] <EGM92> Kab his first born!
[20:52] <OnkelC> think it's called LE 55 A 950 in the states
[20:52] <OnkelC> 2.222EUR, kab
[20:52] <EGM92> ...damn
[20:52] <OnkelC> including shipping
[20:52] <Kabouter> That's still quite a lot for a TV, but not bad for a 55" TV in Euroland
[20:52] <EGM92> VAT in?
[20:52] <Sea_Manky> wait, Onkel, weren't you badmouthing Samsung up and down before?
[20:52] <Kabouter> VAT is always included :P
[20:52] <OnkelC> about half of what it was when released in october
[20:52] <OnkelC> manky, not me
[20:52] <EviLore> $3599 on amazon for the 55 a950
[20:52] <OnkelC> VAT in, yeah
[20:53] <Sea_Manky> I could have sworn when I was looking for one, you kept telling me to avoid Samsung
[20:53] <EGM92> is the 9 series the OLED ones?
[20:53] <OnkelC> no, local dimming LED backlight
[20:53] <EGM92> LED Backlight is sexy.
[20:53] <Kabouter> They have 55" OLED TV's already?
[20:53] <EviLore> I have a samsung tv and samsung monitor, manky.  they're priced aggressively and all around good sets.  
[20:54] <Sea_Manky> EL: No no, I know that, I'm talking about Onkel
[20:54] <EviLore> yah
[20:54] <Sea_Manky> And I did end up with a Samsung anyway
[20:54] <Sea_Manky> Coz I always liked their stuff
[20:54] <OnkelC> I don't exactly like the Samsung Design, but the PQ is just nice
[20:55] <Kabouter> There's not exactly a lot that can horribly wrong in the design
[20:55] <OnkelC> there is, kab, just check the philips sets :P
[20:55] <OnkelC> looks like for the bathroom
[20:55] <Kabouter> They're that bad?
[20:55] <Kabouter> I honest to god wonder why Philips still has a consumer electronics division
[20:56] <OnkelC> they have one slim bezel model that is decent, but the rest...
[20:56] <OnkelC> like mac design gone wrong
[20:56] <Kabouter> http://www.cybertheater.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/philips-42pfl7662d-lcd-tv.jpg < This doesn't seem so awful
[20:59] <stump-work> Requirements for TV set design: Visually minimal but functionally powerful on-display buttons, proper location for ports in the back, slim bezel.
[20:59] <Sea_Manky> works for me
[20:59] <Sea_Manky> I rather like Samsung's simple design

[21:03] <bjork-wtf> I don't know what a levels is
[21:04] <bjork-wtf> some limey school term?
[21:04] <Alone-xp> A-levels = uk standard

[21:04] <bjork-wtf> This was college
[21:04] <FnordChan> Alpha Protocol looks pretty good, but I'm more excited about Agent, if only for the late-70s setting.  Of course, knowing absolutely nothing else about the game helps add to the hype, since there's no pesky actual product to bring me down just yet.
[21:04] <bjork-wtf> so I have no idea

[21:06] <Alone-xp> *crickets*
[21:06] <bjork-wtf> yeah
[21:06] <bjork-wtf> three

[21:11] <Alone-xp> i.e. you disagree?
[21:11] <EviLore> Fnord: that setting in Agent seemed neat, but I don't have any confidence in the gaming being good.  OTOH, Alpha Protocol has a generic vibe to it in videos, but I have a lot of confidence in Obsidian and Chis Avellone to pull off something memorable despite any tech shortcomings

[21:16] <Alone-xp> wat? in 8th grade = end of junior high i was 13
[21:16] <FnordChan> EviLore:  Yeah, Agent is a big question mark at the moment.  I've never actually played an Obsidian game, but I hear they're solid and I like the idea of an espionage game, so I'm intrigued by that.  I like the GTA games (more or less) so I have faith in Rockstar to come through with Agent (especially in terms of world buidling) and I'm a huge Le Carre fan, so that's why Agent has me hyped.  We'll see how it actually looks, however.

[21:19] <duckroll> err
[21:19] <duckroll> k
[21:19] <stump-work> duckroll: The story seems fine and all, but there's no citation at all and no one else ran the story, so it's not clear how the author learned the main facts of the story.
[21:20] <Alone-xp> that move is too logical for sega
[21:20] <FnordChan> EviLore:  Yeah, GTA 4 had problems.  The missions weren't what you would call exciting and I found a serious disconnect between the storyline and the gameplay, in terms of trying to make Nico sympathetic.  Also, lots of the usual Rockstar bullshit bogged things down.  But, there was a lot to like, I felt, and the worldbuilding is absolutely first rate, so we'll see.  Like I said in the Agent thread, it has the potential to be great if they make it
[21:20] <duckroll> stump-work: citation of what
[21:20] * olubode has joined #GA
[21:20] <EviLore> *nod*
[21:20] <Alone-xp> of the source
[21:21] <duckroll> im not really sure what you're looking for
[21:21] <duckroll> im watching the dub now though
[21:21] <stump-work> duckroll: The story asserts two things: IS is coming in spring 2010, Sega is localizing the anime. But it doesn't provide any information about how he knows either.
[21:21] <duckroll> stump-work: Sega updated their portal yesterday
[21:21] <duckroll> it says Spring 2010 now
[21:21] <duckroll> they announced it
[21:21] <stump-work> oh
[21:21] <duckroll> and the anime is dubbed on youtube on Sega's channel
[21:21] <duckroll> so.....
[21:21] <stump-work> okay, I missed that (national holiday yesterday i was out drinking)
[21:21] <duckroll> unless someone paid for a professional dub
[21:22] <duckroll> and hacked their server
[21:22] <stump-work> and saw that story with no citation of that, so...
[21:22] <duckroll> ....i think its official :)
[21:22] <duckroll> the "anime" is just 4 shorts though
[21:22] <duckroll> a few minutes each
[21:22] <stump-work> That story should have really referenced the Sega portal thing :p
[21:23] <EGM92> Are there any apps I can load a youtube link or a flashplayer embedded video link into a program and have it ripped/downloaded?
[21:23] <duckroll> stump-work: yeahhh
[21:23] <duckroll> i thought you knew, because someone updated the thread
[21:23] <duckroll> you should bump it
[21:23] <duckroll> and post the anime!
[21:23] <duckroll> please!
[21:23] <duckroll> need more support :(
[21:23] <KimiNewt> I have an FF add-on for that if you want EGM
[21:24] <duckroll> stump-work: i should add though, the anime shorts, are kinda.... nonsense
[21:24] <EGM92> I don't use FF it's a POS
[21:25] <EGM92> thats why I'm looking for an app to do it
[21:25] <KimiNewt> Chrome or Opera?
[21:25] <Alone-xp> the game has cutscenes there. Do they help make sense of the story?

[00:27] <jett> do LCD monitors still look like crap when you set them to a resolution that's not their "native" one?
[00:27] <Armitage> yeah
[00:28] <jett> sux
[00:30] <jett> i guess that's why pc people are obsessed with getting their games to run at 1080p on their fancy new monitors
[00:34] <Tiduz> 720p looks fine on a 1080p lcd.
[00:34] <Tiduz> ask anyone here who tried
[00:34] <EviLore> and 1080p looks more than fine
[00:34] <EviLore> native res fo life
[00:35] <Tiduz> true
[00:35] <Tiduz> but 720 doesnt look like crap on it imo
[00:35] <Tiduz> :)
[00:37] <jett> evilore: yeah but only if you have an uber video card :P

[01:45] <EGM92> WHAT ?!
[01:45] <KimiNewt> Of course you can't "domesticate" them
[01:45] <KimiNewt> I assume you can tame them if you will
[01:45] <EGM92> BUT THEY'RE CUTE, NOTHING CUTE SHOULD EVER GO ENDANGERED!

[01:50] <Lelielle> no
[01:50] <KimiNewt> No
[01:50] <KimiNewt> It's giving them basic rights
[01:51] <KimiNewt> well there are two movements I think
[01:51] <Lelielle> thye are geared for life in the forest, not a life discussing politics
[01:51] <KimiNewt> one is terrilby crazy saying we should give them practically all rights
[01:51] <EGM92> ..what about forest politics than?
[01:51] <KimiNewt> the other one saying they should have rights for liberty, life and you know, not being jailed and tortured and expiremented on

[02:52] <Nikashi> Nice one Shin
[02:52] <EGM92> ...
[02:52] <bjork-wtf> I remember we carried these loli figures in blind boxes at the shop
[02:52] <EGM92> sometimes no bush is a good thing.
[02:52] <bjork-wtf> I didn't know what the name of the series was
[02:52] <Nikashi> bjork-wtf: You probably could have gotten raided

[02:53] <Nikashi> Probably Kodomo no Jikan, that's the only series I can think of that's loli and has any kind of popularity lol
[02:53] <Nikashi> and would have H- figures I mean
[02:53] <bjork-wtf> nah, it wound up being from some pc game
[02:53] <Nikashi> I doubt there's licensed H-figures of Ichigo Mashimaro for instance :p
[02:53] <bjork-wtf> these were ~6 yrs old too
[02:53] <bjork-wtf> H-figure of miu matsuoka would almost be cool
[02:54] <bjork-wtf> almost
[02:54] <Nikashi> ... er why
[02:54] <Nikashi> http://www.animekon.com/gallery/2007/10/031345552664.jpg <== girl bjork is talking about

[02:54] <EGM92> I went to the pacific mall this morning to get my phone fixed. I seen a guy carrying out a 12"+ statue of Felicia? from darkstalkers out of one of the shops, kinda creepy
[02:54] <Nikashi> Eh, at least it's Felicia

[02:54] <Nikashi> nice big round melons
[02:55] <Nikashi> bjork-wtf: I googled

[03:24] <mrsolo> that bad eh?
[03:24] <Kagari> Bay needs to work on his scripts :/

[03:25] <mrsolo> ah

[04:38] <Orin_WarHammer> Is this socially acceptable? Realized I've been swimming in basketball shorts my whole life, so now I need actual swimming trunks. (I wish Michael Jordan had a swim line)
[04:38] <bjork-wtf> I still wanna know what's up with the hotdog conspiracy
[04:38] <Nikashi> Orin_WarHammer: Only if you're not using them to SWIM IN

[04:47] <Nikashi> Is there a word for "Endorse an item that you actually believe in"
[04:47] <Nikashi> Rather than just being paid to
[04:48] <Sea_Manky> It's harder to shit directly into the pool if you wear underwear under your swim trunks.
[04:48] <GaimeGuy> you've tried?
[04:48] <bjork-wtf> nika> hawk?
[04:49] <bjork-wtf> whore out?
[04:49] <Nikashi> Hawk still kind of implies you're just selling something
[04:49] <Nikashi> Nono, I mean endorsing a product because you actually think it does what it says it does
[04:49] <Nikashi> not because you're gettin paid
[04:49] <bjork-wtf> you could just sell something and still believe in it
[04:49] * bjork-wtf believes in the healing qualities of hentai on dvd
[04:49] <Nikashi> yeah but I'm wondering if there's a word that means that specifically
[04:49] * bjork-wtf , a name you can trust!
[04:50] <GaimeGuy> o_o
[04:50] <bjork-wtf> "promote" is probably the best match
[04:51] <Shinobi_TFC> haha bjork
[04:51] <Shinobi_TFC> let's see
[04:51] <Shinobi_TFC> there's 'shilling'
[04:51] <Shinobi_TFC> 'whoring'
[04:52] <Shinobi_TFC> 'pimpin' is a good one
[04:52] <Nikashi> yeah I was hoping there might be a word that implies that it's not for the cash
[04:52] <Shinobi_TFC> but that's not as cool
[04:52] <bjork-wtf> nika
[04:52] <bjork-wtf> BELIEVE.
[04:53] <Nikashi> Oh wow, Ozzy is the only warcraft endorser who actually had an in game character that looked exactly like him
[04:53] <Nikashi> which makes sense
[04:53] <pj> why the hell would you pimp something for free
[04:53] <Nikashi> Ozzy IS Undead
[04:53] <Nikashi> Fanboy is closer to the meaning I'm looking for

[06:43] <shuriZZz> so he comes up with a plan to donate blood to get a free test
[06:43] <thesoapster> lol
[06:43] <shuriZZz> all of this..because he said he fucked the shit up of some woman in france a year ago without a condom

[07:06] <bjork-wtf> that talks
[07:06] <WasabiKing> oh haha
[07:06] <bjork-wtf> and wears a little neckerchief
[07:06] <thesoapster> WasabiKing: for a while at work, xp sp3 would break dhcp function on all the machines that got it becaseu we're running lucent dhcp server
[07:06] <WasabiKing> I thought you meant the box
[07:06] <thesoapster> and that version had problems
[07:07] <WasabiKing> that's not too bad
[07:07] <WasabiKing> you know what's janky as shit, using mac osx as a server
[07:07] <WasabiKing> my old employer does that, total FIAL
[07:07] <thesoapster> hah
[07:07] <WasabiKing> such a mac whore it's recockulous
[07:07] <ZombieSupaStar> my cat did this when i tried to walk it

[07:08] <ZombieSupaStar> soothe sayer total
[07:08] <WasabiKing> it's going to go straight to shit
[07:08] <nerbo> Steve Jobs is going to live in a cryovat of liquid goo
[07:08] <nerbo> forver

[07:08] <nerbo> *forever
[07:08] <WasabiKing> NERB!
[07:08] <bjork-wtf> wal-mart to buy apple 
[07:09] <ZombieSupaStar> microsoft gotta be getting nervous
[07:09] <thesoapster> i mean there's nothing necessarily wrong with os x server; it's just exchange and active directory has better business-focused stuff
[07:09] <nerbo> sup
[07:09] <avcables> http://gizmodo.com/5306215/enigma-battleship-is-probably-the-best-drinking-game-ever this is terribly awesome

[07:09] <nerbo> haha
[07:09] <WasabiKing> I had a friend try to tell me why his comcast DVR was better than my series 1 tivo
[07:09] <thesoapster> apple knows it and is finally now having native (activesync so not true native) exchange function in os x in snow leopard 
[07:09] <WasabiKing> and I was clowning so hard
[07:09] <nerbo> lulz
[07:09] <nerbo> Comcast DVR blows
[07:09] <WasabiKing> SERIES ONE

[07:10] <darkh23> lol comcast dvr
[07:10] <nerbo> interface is so janky

[07:10] <WasabiKing> my shit beeps, fucker
[07:10] <thesoapster> i have to sleep
[07:10] <thesoapster> see you guys some time today.
[07:10] * thesoapster has quit IRC (Quit: thesoapster)
[07:10] <darkh23> only reason I haven't turned in my comcast dvr for a tivo is cause I'm too lazy to have the stupid comcast morons come out to install cable cards
[07:10] <WasabiKing> not me! I'm gonna be making some money!
[07:11] <WasabiKing> lol
[07:11] <WasabiKing> well, if you start now
[07:11] <WasabiKing> you might get it by xmas
[07:11] <WasabiKing> MIGHT
[07:11] <nerbo> man today I had a for real FML moment
[07:11] <nerbo> admitted a schizophrenic patient
[07:11] <WasabiKing> oh shit
[07:11] <nerbo> who has Huntingtons disease
[07:12] <nerbo> AND Chrons disease
[07:12] <WasabiKing> god damn
[07:12] <nerbo> cruiser pulled up to the admission door
[07:12] <nerbo> sheriff is like "man, I need gloves and cleaner and towers... PLEASE"
[07:12] <nerbo> lady hadn't bathed in weeks
[07:12] <WasabiKing> oh god damn
[07:12] <Tiduz> nice
[07:12] <Tiduz> uncharted 2 remote play
[07:12] <nerbo> covered in fucking BO
[07:12] <nerbo> piss
[07:12] <nerbo> shit caked in
[07:13] <WasabiKing> oh shit
[07:13] <bjork-wtf> :D~
[07:13] <Tiduz> o_o
[07:13] <nerbo> and she was all wobbly because of the Huntington's
[07:13] <nerbo> so we had to have 2 people one ach side of her support her to bring her in
[07:13] <WasabiKing> god damn man
[07:13] <nerbo> the entire suite surrounding where my office is stunk for a half hour after she left
[07:13] <WasabiKing> union pay
[07:13] <bjork-wtf> being morbidly obese is cool
[07:13] <nerbo> I gagged on the smell
[07:14] <nerbo> the sheriff said that while transporting her
[07:14] <nerbo> it was pouring raina nd thunder
[07:14] <nerbo> so he couln't even open his windows on the way over
[07:14] <nerbo> and he literally pulled over halfway to puke on the side of the road
[07:14] <nerbo> I had to seriously question why the fuck I do this job today
[07:14] <bjork-wtf> I would've just puked out the window
[07:15] <nerbo> but worse than this
[07:15] <bjork-wtf> nerb> you should sell anime. it sounds less dangerous than what you describe here
[07:15] <nerbo> when they brought her over to an admission unit
[07:15] <nerbo> a co-worker/friend of mine was one of the THREE people it took to get her into a shower
[07:15] <nerbo> and she had to comb her stank bush for lice!
[07:15] <nerbo> fucking horrid
[07:15] <bjork-wtf> man, that's hot
[07:15] <EviLore> pelham 1 2 3....would've been decent, if tony scott hadn't decided to shoot every scene with motion at FIVE FRAMES PER SECOND WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU
[07:16] <EviLore> extreme overexposed five frames per second
[07:16] <bjork-wtf> when she came out of the shower, was it like when Ally Sheedy comes out at the end of Breakfast Club with combed hair and makeup?
[07:16] <EviLore> yes you're a genius with cinematography now please stop
[07:16] <nerbo> I didn't go anywhere near that unit
[07:16] <nerbo> I barely avoided getting ill just off the smell
[07:17] <minty> sabi: you getting blazblue
[07:17] <bjork-wtf> I had a friend who's neighbor died
[07:17] <nerbo> by far the sickest, most revolting case I have seen in a while
[07:17] <bjork-wtf> but no one knew
[07:17] <bjork-wtf> and the stink permeated the whole neighborhood
[07:17] <bjork-wtf> when the county people came to check on him, I guess he was right by the front door and had basically melted
[07:17] <bjork-wtf> and they all puked out in the yard
[07:18] <SeraphicHeat> Melted?
[07:18] <SeraphicHeat> Like melted.
[07:18] <bjork-wtf> he was a skeleton and a puddle of meat
[07:18] <SeraphicHeat> oh shit
[07:18] <EviLore> <nerbo> so he couln't even open his windows on the way over
[07:18] <EviLore> <nerbo> and he literally pulled over halfway to puke on the side of the road
[07:18] <EviLore> damn dude
[07:18] <bjork-wtf> my friend said the windows were completely black, and they thought he had put up curtains, but it was flies
[07:19] <BJ33> I'm getting hungry
[07:19] * minty slaps BJ33 around a bit with a large trout
[07:19] <EviLore> <nerbo> and she had to comb her stank bush for lice!

[07:25] <avcables> well
[07:25] <minty> ;/
[07:25] <avcables> more aggressive at banning the stupid fucks
[07:25] <bjork-wtf> hades> I have a couple of female friends that would be willing to do it for free
[07:25] <avcables> and less aggressive banning people who decide to mention something about homebrew or women
[07:25] <Shinobi_TFC> LOL @ nerb's/bjork's stories
[07:26] <minty> that's the prob. dragona doesn't ban twats
[07:26] <Shinobi_TFC> holy rank
[07:26] <BJ33> You'd restrict gaime's post limit to sixteen characters
[07:26] <avcables> i know minty
[07:26] <avcables> she bans the WRONG PEOPLE
[07:26] <bjork-wtf> av would ban people for making freckle remarks

[07:26] <avcables> it may not seem like it but i would be such a dank mod
[07:26] <Shinobi_TFC> he wasn't the one who combed ther bush hair for lice
[07:26] <nerbo> well, today I just felt fortunate that I wasn't the one who had to comb her
[07:27] <Shinobi_TFC> at worst nerb's job is #2 on the worst gigs list
[07:27] <Shinobi_TFC> the bush comber's got #1 with a bullet
[07:27] <nerbo> tbh all I did was nearly wretch, call a code and yell "SHOWER SHOWER SHOWER"
[07:27] <Shinobi_TFC> lulz
[07:27] <Shinobi_TFC> with an elephant hose
[07:27] <avcables> if i ever get unbanned, which i totally think should happen because i'll never get banned again btw

[07:27] <Shinobi_TFC> hell, throw her in a goddamn car wash for a couple hours
[07:28] <Shinobi_TFC> lulz @ striving to be a mod

[07:35] <avcables> and they laugh histerically and tell me to do it
[07:35] <avcables> and i do

[07:35] <DrForester> #ga is peer presure at it's worst
[07:35] <avcables> THANKS A LOT #GA YOU'RE LIKE THE HIGH SCHOOL OF THE INTERNET
[07:35] * DrForester gives avcables a swirly
[07:35] * mrsolo has joined #GA
[07:36] <EviLore> that's a very well made trailer
[07:36] <EviLore> but it doesn't show off much of interest in the gameplay department
[07:37] <DrForester> looks very neat
[07:37] <avcables> yea it does look pretty dope
[07:37] <Tre`> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0ewUBTSlvQ
[07:37] <EviLore> people running around with smgs exploding randomly into gibs when they die and some grenade disc thing and a carryable objective.  okay.
[07:37] <Tre`> demo showing off a class
[07:38] * DrForester expected a giant robot at the end
[07:38] <DrForester> still good
[07:38] <EviLore> okay that's more like it
[07:38] <avcables> this looks awesome D:
[07:38] <EviLore> see, I'm extremely wary of cinematic trailers these days
[07:39] <Tre`> haha
[07:39] <bjork-wtf> trailers should be like the one for prisonserver
[07:40] <EviLore> looks very cool
[07:41] <DrForester> hahaha
[07:41] <DrForester> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=16524471&postcount=5142
[07:42] <Tre`> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9vOLiqvBI&feature=channel_page -- showing off night/motion/heat vision
[07:42] <kassatsu> :o gundam senki ps3 theme
[07:42] <DrForester> tre any guestimate on release?
[07:42] <DrForester> or is this like BLack Mesa Source?
[07:43] <Tre`> [23:33] <Tre`> neotokyo tomorrow!

[07:44] <darkh23> whats neotokyo
[07:45] <Tre`> that music
[07:45] <Tre`> so awesome
[07:45] <Tre`> darkh:  HL2 mod
[07:45] <EviLore> the emphasis on special vision modes is cool, but people are just going to max the brightness on their monitors :/
[07:45] <darkh23> is it a free mod?
[07:46] <Tre`> it's against licensing agreements to make a pay mod
[07:46] <EviLore> it's a source mod.  they haven't bought a license.  etc.
[07:47] <Tre`> the only exception to that is really Garry's Mod, which Valve made a special deal with
[07:47] <darkh23> ah trailer looks cool
[07:47] <EviLore> tripwire should pick it up, develop it a bit, and release it, like killing floor.  if it ends up being good
[07:49] <EviLore> haha every 3d FPS ever made has better muzzle flashes than arma2, including this mod
[07:49] <avcables> how is arma2 btw, evilore
[07:49] <avcables> i never heard your thoughts

[07:51] <EviLore> thoughts: janky as fuck, extremely unintuitive control scheme, remapping controls for a left-handed person is still extraordinarily aggravating, buggy as fuck, graphically very uneven, runs poorly, shooting/weapon feel is not satisfying, vehicles are very underdeveloped in realism compared to infantry, squad ai can be random, and it's JANKY AS FUCK
[07:52] <EviLore> but, it still manages to have that spark of something special in there somewhere when things come together well
[07:52] <Tre`> so what you're saying is it's european
[07:52] <EviLore> pretty much, yes
[07:53] <avcables> http://www.atom.com/fun_games/cop_feel/ oh shit hahahahaha
[07:53] <EviLore> also it won't even start on my friend's computer, and I was going to buy it to do the campaign in co-op with him, but now I'm not because of that

[07:56] <EviLore> 3d, in its current form, is a gimmick at best
[07:56] <DrForester> Jett, the navia re 10ft tall furies, heres teh full body shot
[07:56] <DrForester> http://tinyurl.com/kqlcql
[07:57] <bjork-wtf> naruto is up, finally
[07:57] <EviLore> it's going to be really shitty for an action movie.  I watched Up in 3d and the effect was subtle there, and just added inward depth, that worked pretty well.  but the trailers in front of it that really made significant use of the 3 were awful.  they hurt my eyes and got distorted all over the place
[07:57] <DrForester> err, http://tinyurl.com/lga2jq
[07:57] <Tiduz> jett
[07:57] <DrForester> EviLore be galdf you didnt see Monsters Vs Alien
[07:57] <Tiduz> did that dude just put up scans
[07:57] <DrForester> s
[07:57] <Tiduz> LOLOL

[07:58] <Tiduz> now he edited it
[07:58] <Tiduz> ahahaha
[07:58] <jett> That Destin guy is a douche
[07:58] <DrForester> Bolt and Coraline made good use of 3D.  More obvious than UP, but still good use
[07:58] <jett> fuck 3D
[07:58] <avcables> OH MY GOD
[07:58] <bjork-wtf> whoa
[07:58] <avcables> WHY DID YOU LINK THAT THREAD
[07:58] <avcables> EVILORE
[07:58] <avcables> BAN HIM 
[07:58] <bjork-wtf> mizukage hentai plz
[07:58] <avcables> PLEASE
[07:58] <avcables> PLEASSSSSSSSSSSSSSE
[07:59] <avcables> I FUCKING HATE YOU ARNE AND YOUR THE WOOL OVER YOUR BEADY EYES
[07:59] <avcables> MORE LIKE I'M READY TO SHOVE MY FOOT UP HIS ASS
[07:59] <jett> I don't know in what manner Bolt used 3D, but in 2D Coraline the scenes that'd be IN YO FACE 3D are pretty obvious
[07:59] <jett> seriously, fuck 3D
[07:59] <EviLore> james cameron said that avatar is only going to be shown in 3d in theaters, right?
[07:59] <jett> no
[07:59] <jett> it will be shown in 2D
[08:00] <jett> this is a 200 million movie yo
[08:00] <EviLore> okay, that's sensible.  because it'd be impossible to recoup otherwise
[08:00] <jett> or was it 300
[08:00] <jett> i've lost count
[08:00] <kassatsu>  <jett> That Destin guy is a douche <- his hardnews shit on screwattack sucks too
[08:00] <kassatsu> he is just fishing for hits with that post
[08:00] <EviLore> thought I heard him say something to that effect though.  that he would force all the theaters to go digital to facilitate it
[08:01] <jett> evilore: actually, in 2D the movie will be shown in scope, because Cameron actually prefers that format. 3D movies are limited to 16:9
[08:01] <jett> aw snap
[08:01] <pj> how do they de3d a movie
[08:01] <jett> very easily i'm guessing
[08:02] <jett> 3D is a fucking gimmick good for nothing
[08:02] <pj> do they just show one side
[08:02] <pj> i liked the 3d in up
[08:02] <EviLore> oh sam worthington is in avatar eh
[08:02] <pj> its as necessary as color really
[08:03] <jett> too bad those piece of shit glasses darken your view, eliminating some color richness 
[08:03] <jett> i watched UP in 2D, i didn't feel like I lost anything
[08:03] <EviLore> it adds serious artifacting for me
[08:04] <EviLore> like if something is sticking out in the foreground and moving fast, it distorts
[08:04] <pj> screen tearing
[08:04] <EviLore> like, near complete loss of motion resolution
[08:04] <jett> yeah
[08:04] <jett> like scanlines, yes?
[08:04] <pj> i guess if it's not perfect they should just throw it away
[08:04] <EviLore> ...
[08:04] <jett> this digital 3D thing is crap
[08:05] <WasabiKing> <@EviLore> thoughts: janky as fuck, extremely unintuitive control scheme, remapping controls for a left-handed person is still extraordinarily aggravating, buggy as fuck, graphically very uneven, runs poorly, shooting/weapon feel is not satisfying, vehicles are very underdeveloped in realism compared to infantry, squad ai can be random, and it's JANKY AS FUCK - EURO DEV
[08:05] <WasabiKing> I fucking told you
[08:05] <jett> captain eo at disneyland looked better
[08:05] <jett> that's some sad ass shit
[08:08] <EviLore> I dunno if I'd actually watch avatar in 3d
[08:08] <avcables> if you have issues with screen tearing evilore, doesn't 3D do a number on your brain?
[08:09] <jett> i know i'm not
[08:09] <EviLore> it can, yes
[08:09] <EviLore> I've gotten headaches pretty much every time
[08:09] <EviLore> I took some ibuprofen before I saw Up-3d
[08:09] <jett> why would you want to watch an epic action movie in 1.78:1?
[08:09] <EviLore> so I was mostly okay
[08:09] <jett> i'm watching Avatar in 2.35:1, like James Cameron intended
[08:10] <EviLore> well, james cameron also intends for this to change movies forever by ushering in the 3d generation for real
[08:10] <jett> nah that's what dipshits like sculiibundo keep saying
[08:10] <jett> cameron has said that this will not revolutionize anything :P
[08:10] <pj> all movies are gonna be 3d in 10-20 years
[08:11] <HadesGigas> maybe then it will be worth watching them in 3d
[08:11] <EviLore> good thing there will be 100 years of 2d movies for me to watch then
[08:11] <pj> i dont think its ever going to be mind blowing
[08:11] <jett> it's never going to be anything but a gimmick
[08:11] * Armitage has quit IRC (Quit: )
[08:12] <EviLore> what really matters is the home experience anyway.  
[08:12] <EviLore> and I'll stick with 2d viewing at home, so
[08:12] <pj> i bet a lot of this conversation happened when color movies first came out
[08:13] <EviLore> zzzzzz
[08:13] <pj> the technology sucked
[08:13] <pj> too expensive
[08:13] <pj> gimmick
[08:13] <jett> 3DTVs are coming though. it'll be the next piece of crap you don't really need but will buy anyway becuase the constant barrage of ads will convince you to do so
[08:13] <EviLore> we're not gonna put on glasses for every movie at home, and we're pretty far off from consumer adoption of glasses-free 3d displays.  when those hit maybe my eyes will handle 'em better, maybe not
[08:13] <jett> just like somehow everyone is convinced LCD is not a putrid piece of shit technology
[08:14] * Armitage has joined #GA
[08:14] <nerbo> the push for 3D movies is more out of theater's desperation to drive ticket sales as home theater becomes more accessible
[08:14] <EviLore> yes
[08:14] <nerbo> i.e. mostly bullshit
[08:15] <jett> that and and it's impossible to pirate them
[08:15] * Armitage is now known as Dork9180
[08:15] <EviLore> also, going by my experiences with 3d, comparing it to the jump from b&w to color is beyond laughable.  maybe avatar will change that, but I doubt it.  
[08:15] * Dork9180 has quit IRC (Quit: )
[08:15] * Armitage_DAFT has joined #GA
[08:15] <nerbo> it's pretty hard to justify movie ticket prices these days
[08:15] <nerbo> no matter what the screen
[08:15] <pj> its not laughable
[08:15] <jett> why do you think retard execs like katzenberg are so excited about it
[08:15] <pj> color doesnt add much
[08:16] <jett> <pj> color doesnt add much <-- i see. or maybe i don't LULZ
[08:16] <EviLore> there's artistic merit to grayscale, sure, but I'm going to have to sound the moron alert re: that message there
[08:16] <jett> 3D distracts and annoys
[08:17] <pj> current 3d does
[08:17] <pj> ideally it would be like looking through a window
[08:17] <jett> current 3D is the only 3D that exists
[08:17] * Armitage_DAFT is now known as Armitage
[08:17] <jett> there's no plans for another 3D tech to replace the current one
[08:17] * Oldschoolgamer has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[08:17] <EviLore> oh, magical fairy land 3d, that's a different story
[08:17] <pj> it will happen eventually
[08:18] <jett> ideally actresses should leap out of the screen a give me a blowjob
[08:18] <pj> the first color movies were hand tinted or two color monstrosities that are hard to look at
[08:18] <pj> shit got better
[08:19] <jett> when glasses aren't needed, then it'll be better
[08:19] <jett> that's probably never going to happen though
[08:19] <pj> it will be at least a decade before that happens
[08:19] <jett> it's never going to happen
[08:20] <pj> yes it will
[08:20] <Armitage> it'll happen eventually
[08:20] <pj> movie technology isnt going to just stop with digital 3d
[08:20] <jett> 3D adoption rates are dreadfully slow, nevermind the current economical climate. theater chains aren't going to replace all that shit they just bought in 10 years
[08:20] <pj> theres some room for negociation between 10 and never
[08:21] <jett> well you know what i don't care about 3D. but as it is it's never going to work without glasses
[08:22] <pj> thats why it wont always be as it is
[08:22] <EviLore> there are prototype displays that don't require glasses jett
[08:22] <nerbo> theater chains aren't even replacing the shit they bought 20 years ago
[08:22] <EviLore> afaik
[08:22] * EGM92 has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[08:22] <pj> id like to see that in person
[08:22] <jett> evilore: but they aren't proyectors
[08:22] <EviLore> right
[08:22] <pj> i saw some pictures of them but i wasnt impressed
[08:23] <EviLore> so we need 50 foot wide carbon nanotube direct view sets for theaters, simple enough!
[08:23] <Hitokage> that's almost like judging HD based on SD coverage of it
[08:24] <jett> evilore: in ten years man!
[08:24] <pj> thatsthejoke.jpg
[08:24] <jett> believe (tm)
[08:24] <EviLore> anyway, "eventually."  eventually we'll have hoverboards and fembots.  just as irrelevant.  all I know is my eyes aren't going to get any better at handling that shit until they adopt a better way of going about it
[08:24] <darkh23> haha dark messiah is pretty awesome...got to make mah own sword
[08:24] <EviLore> yeah the sword forging was pretty :o at the time
[08:25] <EviLore> watch for secret areas, there are a ton of them and they're in interesting places, and usually have powerful items
[08:25] <darkh23> yeah I just took one through a cave after making my sword and got a ring
[08:25] <Hitokage> well, I'm just happy I don't have evilore's neurological hangups
[08:26] <darkh23> instead of fighting through all the guards the main way
[08:26] <Hitokage> :D

[09:02] <EviLore> man, I hope the psp go gets CFWed at some point.  480mhz processor, RISE TO PORTABLE EMU HEAVEN
[09:02] <Tiduz> yeah that made me interested
[09:02] <Tiduz> Im thinking it would be best to buy at launch, most chance of getting a hack instead of newer ones?
[09:03] <bluemaxmini> i wish we would be able to actually make use of it
[09:03] <bjork-wtf> she's a friend of my cousin, I guess
[09:03] <Tiduz> CFW can ^_^
[09:03] <bluemaxmini> not that processor is the big limiter in psp development
[09:03] <Tiduz> can also force psp to run at 333
[09:03] <Tiduz> wonder if you force it if older games will get less framerate drops
[09:04] <bluemaxmini> eh i mean
[09:04] <bluemaxmini> we can already use the 333hz mode
[09:04] <EviLore> nearly everything benefits from 333 mode hack
[09:04] <Tiduz> yes
[09:04] <bluemaxmini> but the RAM is a bigger issue on psp
[09:04] <Tiduz> i hope they can unlock 480
[09:04] <bluemaxmini> we are going through a nightmare situation at work right now
[09:04] <bluemaxmini> trying to get this stupid port
[09:05] <bluemaxmini> to fit into 32mb
[09:05] <Tiduz> psp 2000 is 64 right?
[09:05] <Tiduz> kinda shitty that you cant make use of that
[09:05] <bluemaxmini> doesnt matter

[09:40] <Kabouter> It was still 27 degrees in here when I went to bed last night
[09:40] <mrsolo> i haven't played my ps3 for such a long time that i can't find the controller now
[09:40] <Tiduz> npdecrypter?
[09:40] <Tiduz> Kabouter: yes that sucks
[09:41] <Tiduz> i went to bed at 8 last night and didnt sleep at 10
[09:41] <Tiduz> horrible
[09:41] <Tiduz> i hate summer+sleep
[09:41] <Kabouter> I did fall asleep within two minutes though
[09:41] <Tiduz> winter+sleep = win
[09:41] <Kabouter> Yay fan
[09:41] <Tiduz> i cant sleep with noise
[09:41] <Tiduz> >:|
[09:41] <kassatsu> fucking lame demo
[09:41] <Kabouter> Oh, that's not an issue for me
[09:41] <kassatsu> it goes for 1:30
[09:41] <kassatsu> and then stops
[09:41] <Kabouter> I can sleep anywhere
[09:41] <Tiduz> lmfao
[09:41] <Tiduz> ill wait for full ver
[09:41] <Tiduz> nice kab
[09:41] <Tiduz> i always take a while to fall asleep
[09:41] <Tiduz> like 30 mins or more
[09:41] <Tiduz> :/
[09:42] <Kabouter> Try reading a little before you go to sleep, usually helps
[09:42] <Tiduz> meh i think its because i think too much
[09:42] <Tiduz> lol
[09:42] <Tiduz> SHOCKING i can think
[09:42] <Tiduz> :P
[09:43] <kassatsu> it only has the book organizing game too so far
[09:43] <kassatsu> D:<
[09:43] <Kabouter> Reading calms you down, you should really try just reading half an hour before you go to bed Tiduz
[09:43] <Kabouter> Surely there's some books that interest you
[09:43] <bjork-wtf> secret plot
[09:44] <Tiduz> game magazines
[09:44] <Tiduz> *rimshot*
[09:44] <Kabouter> Nah, actual book works much better
[09:44] <Tiduz> haha
[09:44] <bjork-wtf> tiduz> here you go http://www.angelfire.com/comics/hentaixtreme/SPDeep.html
[09:44] <Kabouter> I'm sure there's some game novel you're interested in

[09:45] <Tiduz> i hate it when i sleep and theres a song in my head
[09:45] <Tiduz> so annoying

[09:46] <Tiduz> hm next qore is in Japan
[09:46] <Tiduz> GT5 plz
[09:47] <Tiduz> lol @ Adam savage
[09:47] <Tiduz> ''The Wii fit thinks I'm an obese 36 year old dude.''
[09:48] <Kabouter> And he's actually an obese 42 year old dude?
[09:48] <kassatsu> i think this demo download new stuff daily
[09:48] <Kabouter> Sorry, 41
[09:48] <kassatsu> there is a network option
[09:49] <Tiduz> hes not obese? :p
[09:49] <Tiduz> hes the guy from mythbusters
[09:49] <Kabouter> I know who he is, but I'm not too up to date on his weight
[09:49] <Kabouter> Not something that interests me enough to keep up with
[09:49] <Tiduz> oh haha
[09:50] <Tiduz> maybe you watched mythbusters, i dunno
[09:50] <Tiduz> i like the show
[09:50] <Tiduz> time for some shuteye
[09:50] <Tiduz> l8er
[09:52] <bjork-wtf> I think I need to sleep soon too

[10:04] <BossG> no vaseline would hurt though
[10:04] <Tiduz> ''nmh needs a new platform, weve done everything we can on wii''
[10:04] <Tiduz> legend of hero is crying himself to sleep now
[10:04] <Tiduz> and now im really gone
[10:05] <Kabouter> It's awful BossG
[10:06] <Kabouter> Don't bother
[10:07] <BossG> yeah, well I need to see for myself....I figured the casting alone would take this down, like true blood
[10:08] <kassatsu> if anyone in here has Asian ver of MotorStorm 2
[10:08] <kassatsu> the 2nd expansion is leaked on HK PSN
[10:08] <kassatsu> HK$ 60
[10:09] <BossG> so far it's not aweful per say, just way too much exposition,of the type that would put me to sleep
[10:09] <Kabouter> The main guy is an awful actor
[10:10] <Kabouter> He was terrible in that nearly insta-cancelled Fox show New Amsterdam too
[10:10] <BossG> he's b movie ish, but nothign offensive so far....hehe
[10:12] <BossG> speaking of true blood, it's amazing how much HBO has fallen off...I'm glad I cancelled them
[10:12] <mrsolo> eh?
[10:13] <mrsolo> second season is bad?
[10:13] <Kabouter> I have high hopes for that New Orleans show HBO is making
[10:13] <mrsolo> you cancelled hbo?!?!
[10:13] <Kabouter> Premise of that sounds really cool
[10:13] <mrsolo> you know fire and ice is coming to hbo right?
[10:14] <BossG> meh...I could find it on the internets for the couple of things that might be good...
[10:14] <Kabouter> Ooooh, WE WIN, highest gas prices in Europe. $7.65 a gallon right now
[10:15] <kassatsu> the pacific next year too :O
[10:15] <BossG> what is that price without taxes
[10:15] <mrsolo> oh ya the internet
[10:16] <Kabouter> Doesn't say, but still the highest in the industrialized world. For some reason, oil companies get away with charging us more than anyone else.
[10:16] <mrsolo> most of that is tax
[10:16] <mrsolo> which u.s. government has failed to do
[10:17] <Kabouter> Most of it is tax yes, but not all of it
[10:17] <Kabouter> Which is ridiculous
[10:17] <mrsolo> is it?
[10:17] <mrsolo> you can drive less in europe
[10:17] <mrsolo> in most of u.s. we don't have a choice
[10:17] <jakehk> call of juarez best game ever
[10:17] <Kabouter> But why should we pay more than the Belgians then mrsolo?
[10:18] <mrsolo> because lack of gas tax, and urban planing
[10:18] <mrsolo> kabouter: why should i know? as the belgians
[10:18] <mrsolo> ask
[10:18] <Kabouter> Just saying, our pre-tax prices being higher than anyone else's is ridiculous
[10:18] <mrsolo> different fuel mixture
[10:18] <Kabouter> Nope
[10:19] <mrsolo> distrance from refinery?
[10:19] <Kabouter> Refineries are in Rotterdam
[10:19] <mrsolo> principle of supply and demand
[10:19] <Kabouter> So we're closer than almost anyone else :P
[10:19] <mrsolo> gas price is not uniform in united staes
[10:19] <Kabouter> Most countries have no major refineries
[10:19] <mrsolo> heck it differs street corner to street corner
[10:19] <Kabouter> Demand here is not significantly different from neighbouring nations
[10:20] <mrsolo> because you are richer than your neighbours?
[10:20] <Kabouter> The part of Belgium we border is extremely rich
[10:20] <Kabouter> So no

[10:24] <mrsolo> hmm
[10:24] <mrsolo> i think i need to hop on facebook
[10:24] <mrsolo> irc is dying slowly
[10:24] <mrsolo> on all channels
[10:25] <Kabouter> Yeah, Americans going to sleep
[10:25] <Kabouter> Well, Americans and Tiduz
[10:25] <mrsolo> not just that
[10:26] <mrsolo> holiday is coming up too
[10:26] <Kabouter> True
[10:27] <Kabouter> Last work day for many here in the Netherlands today
[10:27] <Kabouter> And Americans probably already off for 4th of july weekend
[10:27] <mrsolo> but that is just short spike
[10:27] <mrsolo> but overall channel trafficewise
[10:27] <mrsolo> irc is slowing down all over
[10:27] <HadesGigas> most places are still open friday
[10:28] <HadesGigas> or well most places that are stores/restaurants that is

[13:11] <Hitokage> lee_n: 247 in Shirase
[13:11] <Hitokage> :D :D :D
[13:11] <lee_n> nice
[13:12] <lee_n> what are you playing with again? arcade stick? keyboard?
[13:12] <Hitokage> and got to 318 in Sudden the other day
[13:12] <Hitokage> dualshock2
[13:12] <lee_n> right
[13:12] <David> Vista appears to be very, VERY slow when copying from flash drives / SD cards
[13:13] <lee_n> Hitokage: you do know that the rotation system is slightly different in shirase, right?
[13:13] <Hitokage> yup
[13:13] <lee_n> makes things a little easier
[13:13] <Hitokage> yeah, it does
[13:13] <lee_n> but the higher speed also makes things harder, so :)
[13:14] <David> 40-50 minutes to copy 1.5 gigs seems silly
[13:14] <lee_n> Hitokage: very good work though
[13:16] <Hitokage> getting into the right rhythm is tricky though
[13:16] <lee_n> oh yeah, and getting thrown off the rhythm is easy.
[13:17] <Hitokage> even by your own celebration :(
[13:18] <lee_n> but that's the beauty of it.. you really have to bring your a-game because you constantly need to push yoursel.f
[13:18] <lee_n> yourself.*
[13:19] <lee_n> Hitokage: btw.. i'm not sure if you noticed (or even if you used to visit the site) but tetrisconcept.com went down
[13:19] <Hitokage> yeah
[13:19] <lee_n> basically one day the admin decided that he didn't want to keep running the site anymore, and gave everyone 2 weeks notice
[13:19] <lee_n> then he changed his mind and killed it off the very same day
[13:19] <lee_n> he didn't want to hand over the database to others either.. he just killed it off
[13:20] <Hitokage> what a dick
[13:20] <lee_n> thankfully we managed to get everything through other means.. and we brought it back up again
[13:20] <lee_n> so now it's on www.tetrisconcept.net
[13:20] <lee_n> he's not very pleased.. but the site lives on.
[13:20] <Hitokage> fuck him
[13:21] <Hitokage> you should make a page devoted to saying just that
[13:21] <lee_n> the forum posts, the wiki entries.. it's all there.
[13:21] <lee_n> but since we never got the database, everyone has to re-register
[13:21] <lee_n> and the new accounts then have to be tied to the old posts by hand.
[13:21] <sprusk> god damn mh3 is goign to be some epic shiz
[13:22] <lee_n> Hitokage: and yeah.. he's kind of a dick.
[13:22] <David> Why'd he want it to die?
[13:22] <lee_n> i mean.. he has every right to step down as an admin..
[13:22] <David> That's the insanely in-depth Tetris site, right?
[13:22] <lee_n> yeah
[13:22] <lee_n> we don't know
[13:22] <lee_n> never got any proper answer
[13:22] <David> I just clicked over to the Wiki... yep, that's it.
[13:22] <lee_n> he said he didn't want to keep working on it anymore.
[13:23] <David> With the info on random block formulas and all
[13:23] <lee_n> and he didn't trust anyone to take care of it.
[13:23] <Hitokage> yeah, certainly, you can get tired of doing something and leave it for others to manage
[13:23] <lee_n> BUT.. here's the kicker
[13:23] <Hitokage> but taking the ball and running home is fucking infantile
[13:23] <lee_n> a while back.. maybe a year or so ago.. wikia.com randomly offered to start hosting the TC wiki.
[13:23] * Tony_Parker has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[13:23] <lee_n> everyone voted against it because wikia kinda sucks
[13:23] <lee_n> lots of ads and stuff
[13:24] <lee_n> really intrusive stuff.. in the middle of articles and things like that
[13:24] <lee_n> now.. with the shutdown of TC.. he handed over the wiki contents to THEM anyway.
[13:24] <lee_n> but yeah.. we managed to save it
[13:24] <lee_n> the wikia mirror won't be updated because we have it on a proper site.
[13:24] <lee_n> so it'll fade into oblivion.
[13:25] <David> Site drama. Sigh.
[13:26] <lee_n> yeah, it's pretty insane.
[13:26] <lee_n> but it worked out in the end.
[13:26] <lee_n> and now the site is in good hands.
[13:26] <lee_n> despite the old admin's best efforts trying to prevent that.
[13:26] <David> I am vaguely reminded of when Nintendorks had their chatroom split into pieces.
[13:27] <lee_n> anyway.. i gotta run off now
[13:28] <lee_n> but now you know where to find tetrisconcept.
[13:28] <lee_n> <homestar> IT'S DOT NET! </homestar>
[13:28] <David> The next time I need to know which tetris game has true random block selection vs. which ones use sorted bags, I know where to go!
[13:29] <lee_n> don't forget about the 4memory system of tgm!
[13:29] <lee_n> ;)
[13:29] <lee_n> well, later
[13:29] <David> Or a detailed breakdown of infinite floor spin
[13:29] <lee_n> yup
[13:29] <David> Which appears to be SOMEWHAT modified for the WiiWare Tetris thing

[13:54] <David> I've been copying a 2GB SD card for the past.... hour?
[13:54] <David> It's still transferring, as I can see each file being successful, but it's at a crawl.
[13:57] <Kabouter> Still?
[13:57] <Kabouter> Man
[13:57] <Kabouter> I know Vista is slow as hell with file transfers
[13:57] <Kabouter> But it's not THAT slow for me
[13:57] <David> I'm puzzled.
[13:57] <David> I mean, I'd assume it was a slow SD card, but the first 800 MB transferred fairly quickly.
[13:58] <David> It -might- just be a load of TINY files...maybe
[13:58] <David> I'm transferring my Treo SD card contents to a Micro SDHC for my Centro
[13:58] <David> I -think- the slowdown occurred when it reached the BackUp directories... which, upon further reflection, each appear to contain 500 or so individual, tiny files

[14:36] <Magus> after trying monster hunter for psp i don't see what's the big deal...
[14:36] <Tre`> if anything, I want a new, non-shitty PSO :/
[14:37] <sprusk> mh is a bit different than diablo though
[14:37] <Tre`> that's why I said "style"
[14:37] <Tre`> instead of "diablo-clones"
[14:37] <David> and what's the deal with MH3 at this point, anyway?
[14:37] <David> (still waiting for his SD card to finish)
[14:37] <sprusk> diablo is to sega rally as monster hunter is to colin mcrae
[14:37] <Tre`> they're different, but similar
[14:37] <Tre`> yes
[14:38] <Tre`> different, but both still rally racing arcade games

[16:21] <sprusk> theres a 77 year old woman playing ff12 on tv
[16:22] <Kabouter> Is that the game that plays itself?
[16:22] <Tiduz> think im gonna try to ebay blazblue
[16:22] <Tiduz> 90 euros is a bit too much
[16:23] <sprusk>  only if you set it to kabouter
[16:24] * Valtor has joined #GA
[16:24] <Kabouter> Oh okay
[16:24] <Kabouter> I kept reading that FF XII played itself on GAF
[16:25] <Kabouter> Guess those people are like the people who complain about having the option of quicksave
[16:25] <Tiduz> is 60 the standard price for cross edge
[16:25] <sprusk> haha shes some sort of brain doctor
[16:25] <Tiduz> anyone know?
[16:25] <Tiduz> or is it a 40 game
[16:25] <sprusk> and dr kawashima sent her brain training without a ds, so she never played it
[16:26] <Tiduz> blazblue for 53 euros
[16:26] <Tiduz> thats more like it
[16:26] <sprusk> this is good though, finally someone in a public space is saying games are actually good for your brain
[16:26] <Tiduz> i rike japanese sellers
[16:26] <Tiduz> BlazBlue
[16:26] <Tiduz> (English , English ver.)
[16:26] <Tiduz> doesnt say if its the CE
[16:26] <Tiduz> hm
[16:27] <Kabouter> Well, by developing Americas Army, so does the US Army sprusk :P
[16:27] <Kabouter> (At least good if the goal is becoming a soldier :P)
[16:28] <sprusk> haha
[16:28] <ghst> american taxpayers need to fund more of the games i play
[16:28] <Tiduz> Blazblue CE 60 euros
[16:28] * Amir0x has joined #GA
[16:28] <Tiduz> sounds reasonable
[16:28] <Kabouter> Yeah, great idea
[16:28] <Kabouter> California has to end welfare
[16:29] <Tiduz> question
[16:29] <Kabouter> But developing games with public money at the same time, sweeeeeeet
[16:29] <Tiduz> before i get owned again
[16:29] <Kabouter> :P
[16:29] <Tiduz> USPS First Class Mail InternationalTM
[16:29] <Tiduz> is this good shipping
[16:29] <sprusk> well japan is the country that came up with "game brain" a made up sickness that said games made kids stupid
[16:29] <Tiduz> guy has 450x 100% feedback
[16:29] <Tiduz> hrm
[16:29] <Kabouter> Haha lol
[16:29] <Tiduz> FFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU its 360
[16:29] <Tiduz> bastard
[16:29] <Tiduz> using ps3 cover
[16:29] <Kabouter> That's even worse than Germany's "Killerspiele"
[16:30] <ghst> isn't japan all about consoles? 
[16:30] <sprusk> portables more than consoles
[16:30] <ghst> i feel pretty stupid when i play one of them these days too.
[16:30] <sprusk> but i guess so yeah
[16:30] <sprusk> pc penetration is surprisingly low
[16:31] <sprusk> and most pcs here are sold as tv/pc hybrids
[16:31] <Kabouter> I dunno ghst, trying to figure out the NXE is quite a strain on any brain
[16:31] <ghst> then they don't deserve games.
[16:31] <Kabouter> Japan probably wouldn't care for PC games anyway
[16:31] <sprusk> there is are hardcore pc gamers here in japan though
[16:31] <sprusk> that play the same games people in the states do
[16:31] <Kabouter> PC games are generally made with continental European tastes in mind
[16:32] <sprusk> one of the more popular game video series on niconico was one featuring stalker
[16:32] <sprusk> for instance
[16:32] <sprusk> and no not some crazy rape game named stalker
[16:32] <Kabouter> Haha
[16:32] <Kabouter> I hadn't even thought of that joke, I fail
[16:32] <ghst> japan used to have a weird fondness for impenetrably complex games
[16:33] <ghst> like
[16:33] <ghst> games like fire emblem are a big deal
[16:33] <Kabouter> Well sure, but not the same complex games that Europe is into
[16:33] <ghst> games like kings bounty/homm are unheard of over there
[16:33] <Kabouter> And...well...I don't think the US is into complex games
[16:33] <ghst> even though theyre really the same genre.
[16:34] <Tre`> tiduz:  first class international takes like 3 weeks
[16:34] <sprusk> i dunno, id say the ratio is the same in the states
[16:34] * Axord has joined #GA
[16:34] <sprusk> the amt of people that play super hardcore strat games to ones that play like fire emblem
[16:34] <sprusk> CIV is really popular amongst hardcore gamers here
[16:34] <Tre`> japan's just pussified
[16:34] <Tre`> now they're all about dog training
[16:34] <Tre`> on their DS
[16:35] <ghst> why arent there games like civ coming out of japan then?
[16:35] <Tre`> neotokyo needs to hurry up and come out
[16:35] <Kabouter> There are like ten people in the US who play super hardcore strat games
[16:35] <Kabouter> And most of them are on GAF
[16:35] <ghst> +1 on neo tokyo
[16:36] <Kabouter> I would love to see a Japanese World War 2 grand strategy game
[16:36] <ghst> there is 
[16:36] <ghst> valkyria chronicles
[16:36] <Kabouter> Hahah
[16:36] <Kabouter> Seriously though, it'd be amazing
[16:36] <Tiduz> goddam Tre`
[16:36] <Tiduz> i kinda want blaz
[16:36] <Tiduz> but not for 90 euros lol
[16:36] <Kabouter> "Glorious Japanese soldiers fought bravely and subdued the barbaric forces of China at Nanking"
[16:37] <Tiduz> import shop here gets it for that price
[16:37] <Tiduz> ridicuous
[16:37] <Tiduz> l*
[16:37] <ghst> trying to think of german made ww2 games
[16:37] <Kabouter> ...
[16:37] <Kabouter> How about like 90% of WW2 games?
[16:37] <ghst> name some
[16:38] <Kabouter> Codename Panzers series
[16:38] <Kabouter> Hell, pretty much anything published by CDV
[16:38] <Kabouter> Tbh though, I suck at remembering those names
[16:38] <Kabouter> Because they're all super generic
[16:38] <ghst> yeah. i'm not saying it in a calling you out way, there are none way.
[16:39] <Kabouter> Oh, I didn't think you were
[16:39] <Kabouter> But really, Germany makes a fuckton of WW2 games, and not ones that necessarily portray Germans in the best light either
[16:39] <thesoapster> that's because germany actually has a sense of shame about that
[16:39] <Kabouter> Yeah
[16:39] <thesoapster> whereas japan is fine brushing their shit under the rug
[16:40] <Kabouter> It's quite different from Italy, Austria and especially Japan
[16:40] <sprusk> woah hey throw out your blankets everyone
[16:42] <Kabouter> Why? :P
[16:42] <ghst> yeah. it's not like there's an argument here.
[16:42] <ghst> i'd say read a history book. but they probably burned them all over there.
[16:43] <sprusk> there are many many many people especially people under 50 who think what japan did in the war was unforgivable
[16:43] <thesoapster> ghst: wrong
[16:43] <thesoapster> they wrote their own :P
[16:43] <sprusk> its not like everyones like "what war??"
[16:43] <thesoapster> sprusk: i didn't say all japanese people were that way
[16:43] <Kabouter> Co-workers of ddk thought Japan fought alongside the US against the Nazis in WW2 sprusk
[16:43] <Kabouter> I thought that was pretty sad
[16:43] <Kabouter> Of course an exception, but still
[16:43] <sprusk> yeah, some americans think north korea is australia...
[16:44] <Kabouter> Haha that video is classic
[16:44] <thesoapster> classically terrible
[16:44] <thesoapster> i want to punch those people
[16:44] <Kabouter> Dumb people everywhere
[16:44] <Kabouter> Just that everyone always goes to like Texas to make those videos
[16:44] <thesoapster> i have never taken a geography course but goddamn
[16:44] <Tre`> <thesoapster> whereas japan is fine brushing their shit under the rug -- Valkyria's kinda shameful in that way
[16:44] <Tre`> pretty lulz though
[16:45] <ghst> tre` - most singularly offensive game of all time.
[16:45] <thesoapster> valkyria?
[16:45] <Tre`> valkyria chronicles
[16:45] <thesoapster> what's it about
[16:45] <Kabouter> Could be worse though, instead of brushing it under the rug, they could acknowledge what they did and say "Hey, we should've finished the job"
[16:45] <Kabouter> You know, just like 20% of Hungary.
[16:45] <thesoapster> XD
[16:45] <Tre`> it's set in a alternate world
[16:45] <ghst> you don't wanna know soap
[16:45] <thesoapster> actually i do
[16:45] <Tre`> in a 1930s-40s era
[16:45] <Tre`> and there's a big world war
[16:45] <Tre`> (but no japaneses)
[16:45] <Magus> have you guys ever heard of ring of red?
[16:45] <Tre`> think of it like an alternate WW2
[16:45] <Kabouter> They invade a fake Netherlands right Tre`?
[16:45] <Tre`> where it's just the europeans
[16:45] <thesoapster> as in japan did not participate?
[16:46] <Tre`> there wasn't even a japan on the map, it all used fake countries
[16:46] <Magus> it was a strategy rpg made by konami at the start of ps2 life cycle
[16:46] <thesoapster> bizarre
[16:46] <Tre`> but there were none distinctively asian
[16:46] <Magus> it was set after WW2
[16:46] <Tre`> and yes, I guess it was a fake netherlands
[16:46] <Magus> basicaly japan invented mech and then splitted in two or something like that
[16:46] <Kabouter> Stop interrupting Tre` Magus
[16:46] <Magus> sorry ^_^'
[16:46] <thesoapster> 'mech'? like battlemechs? lol
[16:46] <Tre`> they invaded a neutral country that was between the two big warring states
[16:47] <Tre`> but yeah
[16:47] <Tre`> it's pretty much just an alternate WW2 in an alternate universe
[16:47] <Tre`> with lots of very obvious european country parallels
[16:47] <thesoapster> mm.
[16:47] <Tre`> (but no asian characters)
[16:47] <thesoapster> i see
[16:47] <Tre`> all the characters names were like
[16:47] <Tre`> Susie
[16:47] <Tre`> etc.
[16:48] <Tre`> Susie, Edy, oscar, catherine, so on
[16:48] <Tre`> and what's worse
[16:48] <Tre`> there's even racism
[16:48] <Tre`> like pseudo "we hate jews"
[16:48] <ghst> it's a diabetic lolicon re imagining of ww2 that excuses japan entirely and trivializes the whole conflict into a bug eyed saccharine emo wankfest.
[16:48] <Tre`> a dark haired race with strong spiritual (read: religious) beliefs
[16:49] <Kabouter> You know ghst, if Charlie Brooker ever retires...
[16:49] <Tre`> it's a good game, though!
[16:49] <Tre`> loljapan aside
[16:49] <Kabouter> Really though, we need a WW2 grand strategy game from Japan a la Hearts of Iron
[16:50] <Kabouter> I'd love to see what they come up with
[16:50] <thesoapster> do you know where the term kamikaze came from
[16:50] <thesoapster> anyone
[16:50] <ghst> it's basically everything i hate about japanese stylistic choices in games. 
[16:50] <thesoapster> haha
[16:50] <Kabouter> It's some weird term
[16:51] <ghst> between that and chris redfield
[16:51] <Kabouter> Like something like holy wind or something
[16:51] <Kabouter> But I might be wrong
[16:51] <sprusk> if valkyrie is lolicon then what is kodomonojikan
[16:52] <Kabouter> Come again?
[16:52] <Tre`> something no one in here has ever seen or cares about
[16:52] <sprusk> its something you dont want to see
[16:52] <sprusk> all im saying is valkyrie is faaaaaaaaaaaaar from loli
[16:52] <thesoapster> divine wind, yeah
[16:53] <thesoapster> Kabouter: but do you know where the term came from? :p
[16:53] <Kabouter> No idea
[16:53] <Kabouter> Emperor farting?
[16:53] <thesoapster> that would be pretty amazing
[16:53] <Tre`> man
[16:53] <Tre`> that 2k game pack on steam
[16:53] <Tre`> that is epic
[16:53] <Kabouter> Yeah, shame I already own all that is good in that pack though
[16:53] <thesoapster> Kabouter: you remember genghis khan?
[16:54] * ghst has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[16:54] <thesoapster> or ghengis..however you wish to spell it
[16:54] <Kabouter> The mongol conqueror or the German group?
[16:54] <thesoapster> he had a descendant (kublai khan) 
[16:54] <Kabouter> Yes, his grandson
[16:54] <Kabouter> Oh, this the story of when their entire invasion fleet went down?
[16:54] <thesoapster> he tried to invade japan
[16:54] <thesoapster> yes
[16:54] <thesoapster> TWICE
[16:54] <Kabouter> Yes
[16:54] <Kabouter> Weather shit
[16:54] <Kabouter> I remember that
[16:54] <thesoapster> divine wind :D
[16:54] <sprusk> jing jing jingis kahn hey laka hoi  laka
[16:54] <Kabouter> Haha nice
[16:55] <Kabouter> Didn't a tornado save the US in the war of 1812?
[16:55] <thesoapster> who knows.
[16:55] <Tre`> no
[16:55] <Tre`> but our weather machine did
[16:55] <Tre`> :USA USA USA
[16:55] * ghst has joined #GA
[16:56] <thesoapster> woah. that 2kgames pack is huge
[16:56] <thesoapster> Tre`: :D
[16:56] <thesoapster> bioshock was cool, but i still haven't finished it. i get sidetracked while playing and i just end up feeling bored with it
[16:57] <thesoapster> then again that's happened to just about every shooter i've tried to play through recently...minus like...crysis
[16:57] <Kabouter> http://www.roanoke.com/weather%5Cwb/79760
[16:57] <sprusk> yeah i enjoyed bioshock but i just kinda got tired of it
[16:58] <Tre`> the problem with bioshock
[16:58] <ghst> bioshock had a great setting, moderate narrative and shitty combat.
[16:58] <Tre`> is that the opening sequence was too good for the game
[16:58] <Tre`> raised expectations too high
[16:58] <sprusk> yeah, right
[16:59] <sprusk> you got really into it, then it just settled down and stayed one note
[16:59] <ghst> which is more than most modern fps
[16:59] <Kabouter> Bioshock was fun
[16:59] <Kabouter> 7.5/10
[16:59] <ghst> which have a shitty setting, shitty narrative and shitty combat
[16:59] <sprusk> well, thats why it got so much attention, lol
[17:00] * Kawasaki has quit IRC (Quit: )
[17:00] <Kabouter> I prefer Crysis which has a great setting, shitty but easily ignored narrative and awesome combat
[17:00] <Tiduz> Just bought cross edge instead
[17:00] <Tiduz> Blazblue for 90 is a no go
[17:00] <Tiduz> illw ait for pricedrop
[17:00] <Kabouter> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/97/Cross_Edge_USA.jpg < Really Tiduz? REALLY?
[17:01] <Tiduz> yup
[17:02] <thesoapster> that is what killed it for me
[17:02] <thesoapster> shitty combat
[17:02] <Tiduz> for the record Kabouter
[17:02] <thesoapster> i like fear 2 but i stopped that
[17:02] <Tiduz> http://www.eldojogamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/blazblue-360-cover.jpg
[17:02] <Tiduz> animu as well
[17:02] <thesoapster> on the hardest difficulty it's still shooting fish in a barrel
[17:02] <ghst> "Gurrah asks: Iâ€™ll keep it short: No PC version, why? Iâ€™m sad.
[17:02] <ghst> Tim Schafer: Well itâ€™s really an action game, that when you play it youâ€™ll see that it was meant to be on a console. My question is, â€˜Why all the hate for consoles?â€™ If you hate consoles, that means you hate Katamari Damacy, Okami, ICO, and you are in fact a bad person. A bad person who should send all their hate mail to Eurogamer and not to me."
[17:02] <Kabouter> That is much less embarassing animu though Tiduz
[17:03] <Kabouter> That Cross Edge boxart looks like it's either targeted towards pedophiles or 13 y/o girls
[17:03] <Tiduz> lol im not emberassed at all
[17:03] <Tiduz> :)
[17:03] <Tiduz> Its a RPG with namco vs other chars
[17:03] <Tiduz> not a creep pedo game
[17:03] <Kabouter> I'm saying that's what it looks like
[17:03] <thesoapster> :p
[17:03] <DrForester> corss edge looks like generic anime syle RPG boxart #297
[17:04] <Tiduz> lets not start about wii boxarts plz
[17:04] <Tiduz> D:
[17:04] <Tiduz> but in all seriousness, i dont give a crap about boxart
[17:04] <Tiduz> never look at it anyways
[17:04] <Tiduz> heh
[17:04] <Tre`> ghst:  Honestly
[17:04] <Tre`> it's easy to be like
[17:05] <Tre`> TIM SCHAFER IS A TRAITOR
[17:05] <Tre`> but
[17:05] <Tiduz> '' Microsoft being sued over alleged XBL voice chat patent infringement ''
[17:05] <Tre`> doublefind has been fucked by publishers so often since they've started
[17:05] <Tre`> Brutal Legend was *this* close to not happening at all
[17:05] <Tre`> I don't think they really have a say in what platforms it comes out on
[17:05] <Tiduz> Brutal legend looks awesome
[17:05] <Tre`> so he's just towing company line
[17:05] <Tre`> or rather, publisher line
[17:05] <Tiduz> pc port will probably come down he line
[17:05] <Tiduz> the*
[17:06] <syllogism> brutal legend gameplay doesnt seem too hot
[17:06] <ghst> creating shitty strawman arguments and ostracizing the fanbase that made your name = towing a company line?
[17:06] <Tiduz> gameplay looked fun too me
[17:06] <Tre`> ...yes.
[17:06] <Tiduz> i dont need 600 moves for a game like that
[17:06] <Tiduz> lol
[17:06] <sprusk> yeah, honestly, with a guy like tim schafer, it doesnt make sense to expect him to beat a dead horse if money doesnt fall out
[17:06] <Tre`> he can't really say "Well, our publisher's not paying us enough money"
[17:07] <Tre`> it's not the first time a company has used that excuse
[17:08] <Tre`> "well X platform just isn't suited for..."
[17:08] <Kabouter> OR
[17:08] <sprusk> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhkm_1uXZQQ&feature=haxa_popt00us04 bono sucks.
[17:08] <Tre`> and then the game comes out sometime later anyway
[17:08] <Kabouter> It's just what he actually thinks
[17:08] <Tre`> well I'm sure that's the right line of thinking if you want to be a RABBLLE RABBLE angry bitter PC dude
[17:08] <ghst> i don't give that much of a damn about whatever exclusivity deals double fine went with.
[17:09] <Tre`> as far as the whole "you are a bad person" stuff
[17:09] <Tre`> Do you have any knowledge of tim schafer's sense of humor?
[17:09] <Tre`> he did the exact same thing with psychonauts and the non-existant gamecube port
[17:09] <Tre`> and you guys sound an awful lot like gamecube fanboys
[17:09] <Tre`> you don't want to be that
[17:10] <ghst> you guys? 
[17:10] <Tre`> you
[17:10] <Tre`> and kab
[17:10] <ghst> me and kab huh
[17:10] <sprusk> you and kab
[17:10] <Tre`> and like, all of shacknews' comment section
[17:10] <sprusk> family feud was an awesome show back in the day
[17:10] <ghst> what are you talking about?
[17:10] <Tre`> or was it RPS
[17:11] <Tre`> ...what you've been talking about?
[17:11] <Shinobi_TFC> fed to serve for his 7th straight wimbeldon final
[17:11] <Shinobi_TFC> ho hum
[17:11] <ghst> nah, you're in the act of doing some crazy opinion voodoo on me
[17:11] <Tre`> shinobi:  another day in the life of federbot
[17:11] <Tre`> <ghst> creating shitty strawman arguments and ostracizing the fanbase that made your name = towing a company line?
[17:11] <Tre`> some voodoo
[17:11] <ghst> which part of that do you disagree with?
[17:12] <ghst> the strawman argument is there.
[17:12] <Tre`> uh, all of it, obviously
[17:12] <Shinobi_TFC> lulz, triple match point already
[17:12] <ghst> and pc dudes are pissed with his statements.
[17:12] <Shinobi_TFC> fedbot initiated
[17:12] <ghst> neither of those are debatable
[17:12] <Shinobi_TFC> done
[17:12] <Shinobi_TFC> termination complete
[17:12] <Kabouter> People who are pissed, or are in denial, are like Gamecube fanboys
[17:12] <ghst> you have no idea what i think about the situation
[17:13] <Shinobi_TFC> LOL @ winning last ten points on serve
[17:13] <ghst> but still you impose that and group me in on assumption
[17:13] <Tre`> I wonder how someone would've gotten that assumption
[17:13] <ghst> explain
[17:13] <ghst> please
[17:13] <Shinobi_TFC> *sips his hot chocolate*
[17:14] <Tre`> I've already explained it like, the entire screen up
[17:14] <Tre`> it's just PR speak
[17:15] <Tre`> It's not a personal shot at PC gamers
[17:15] <Tre`> it's not "ostracizing the fanbase"
[17:15] <ghst> yeah it is. 
[17:15] <Kabouter> No, it's just explaining how he really feels about things
[17:15] <ghst> look at the reaction
[17:16] <ghst> the fanbase is pissed
[17:16] <ghst> i'm not a part of that fanbase
[17:16] <Kabouter> Yeah, the fanbase is way too touchy
[17:16] <Kabouter> Kinda like Gamecube fanboys
[17:16] <ghst> i didn't even like pyschonauts
[17:16] <Shinobi_TFC> fanboys are touchy, film at 11
[17:16] <Kabouter> Yeah, many are pissed, Tre` is in the denial phase
[17:16] <Tiduz> ok cross edge nvm
[17:16] <Tiduz> 3.5
[17:16] <Tre`> kab:  I've already gone through all the stages
[17:16] <Tiduz> and framerate problems in a 2D game
[17:16] <Tiduz> smh
[17:16] <Shinobi_TFC> haha
[17:16] <Tiduz> ill just get wiimotion+ instead so i can pirate wii sports 2
[17:16] <ghst> pyschonauts which was just as much a console game as brutal legend anyway.
[17:17] <Kabouter> How do you know?
[17:17] <Kabouter> How much Brutal Legend have you played?
[17:17] <Tiduz> 90% of gaf dissed brutal legend at e3
[17:17] <Tiduz> lolz
[17:17] <Tiduz> i liked it snce th start
[17:17] <Shinobi_TFC> fed's never lost a set in his 7 wimbeldon semi finals
[17:17] <Shinobi_TFC> lulz
[17:18] <Tre`> I'd buy a brutal legend DVD that just had tim schafer doing commentary
[17:18] <Tre`> anyway, the bottomline is
[17:19] <Tre`> you say you're not a part of that fanbase, and that may very well be true but statements like "creating shitty strawman arguments and ostracizing the fanbase that made your name" give that impression
[17:19] <ghst> both of those things are true
[17:19] <Tre`> because that definitely sounds butthurt
[17:19] <ghst> lolol butthurt
[17:20] * sprusk slaps ghst around a bit with a large trout
[17:20] <Tiduz> ff13 to ps3: part II
[17:20] <Tiduz> j/k
[17:20] <Tiduz> to 360*
[17:20] <Shuri> brutal legend will die at retail
[17:20] <Kabouter> Yes it will
[17:21] <Shuri> it looks like a weird spinoff of guitar hero
[17:21] <Kabouter> Who was crazy enough to pick that up anyway? EA?
[17:21] <sprusk> it has a better chance than psychonauts did
[17:21] <Tiduz> Ill buy it
[17:21] <Shuri> with the main character looking exactly like the guitar hero guy
[17:21] <Tre`> it definitely has a better chance than psychonauts
[17:21] <Tiduz> Shuri just plays iphone games
[17:21] <Tiduz> dont listen to him
[17:21] <Tiduz> :b
[17:21] <Tre`> shuri plays iphone games and Shadowruin
[17:21] <Kabouter> Activision definitely made the right call dumping Brutal Legend
[17:21] <ghst> it really doesn't look good. 
[17:21] <ghst> or funny
[17:21] <Tiduz> it doesz look fun
[17:21] <Shuri> haha
[17:21] <Tiduz> which is all that matters
[17:21] <Kabouter> It really isn't
[17:21] <ghst> or fun
[17:22] <Shuri> it looks really terrible
[17:22] <Jideo> who is the pub now?
[17:22] <Tiduz> opinions
[17:22] <Lo-Volt> EA.
[17:22] <Shuri> its like they made the game for the Wayne and Garth demographic
[17:22] <Tiduz> arguing is pointless
[17:22] <Shuri> but that demographic stop existing in 1993
[17:22] <Kabouter> EA has been on a releasing games without commercial potential roll lately
[17:22] <Kabouter> With Mirror's Edge, Dead Space and now Brutal Legend
[17:22] <Kabouter> So it makes sense
[17:22] <Lo-Volt> Dead Space sold OK, apparently.
[17:22] <Tiduz> mirrors edge was awesome.
[17:22] <Jideo> ea trying to restore their image
[17:23] <Tre`> kab:  I can't wait for EA to get over that
[17:23] <sprusk> i think a heavy metal game is appealing to people
[17:23] <Tiduz> Dead space was a good game too
[17:23] <Tre`> and start making more harry potter games
[17:23] <sprusk> it depends on the marketing
[17:23] <Kabouter> Well, while EA is worrying about their reputation amongst hardcore gamers
[17:23] <Tiduz> Tre`: sarcasm ftw
[17:23] <Lo-Volt> Sold enough that there's apparently a sequel.
[17:23] <Tiduz> Lo-Volt: ME2 is coming too
[17:23] <Tiduz> but with a smaller team
[17:23] <Kabouter> Activision will spend money hiring additional money counters
[17:23] <Lo-Volt> Ugh.
[17:23] <Tiduz> hopefully more refined
[17:23] <Lo-Volt> Well, good for them.
[17:23] <Tiduz> ME was fun
[17:23] <Lo-Volt> If you say so.
[17:23] <Tiduz> unless you get motion sickness
[17:23] <Tiduz> lol
[17:24] <Lo-Volt> I personally did not like it.
[17:24] <Lo-Volt> And not because of motion sickness.
[17:24] <sprusk> i get motion sickness
[17:24] <Kabouter> I didn't get any from Mirror's Edge
[17:24] <Tre`> I've never gotten motion sickness
[17:24] <Lo-Volt> Well, I don't get it from games, usually.
[17:24] <Kabouter> Prey though
[17:24] <Kabouter> Prey was AWFUL
[17:24] <sprusk> i wish i was you tre :(
[17:24] <Kabouter> Literally made me throw up
[17:24] <sprusk> yeah prey killed me
[17:24] <Lo-Volt> Because it sucked so much?
[17:24] <sprusk> half life 2 fucking destroyed me
[17:24] <Kabouter> No Lo-Volt
[17:24] <sprusk> i couldnt play it longer than 5 minutes
[17:24] <Lo-Volt> I jest.
[17:24] <Kabouter> Because it was like being on a fucked up rollercoaster
[17:24] <Lo-Volt> Or not?
[17:25] <Kabouter> Other than that, it was an okay game
[17:25] <Tre`> neotokyo chatroom has 370 people in it
[17:25] <Kabouter> Nothing amazing, but without motion sickness, worth the €5 it cost me
[17:25] <Tre`> I think this might be huge.
[17:25] <Tre`> and gamesurge just randomly disconnected me.
[17:25] <ghst> you don't have to get motion sickness to fine the giant contracting assholes of prey nauseating 
[17:25] <Lo-Volt> Brutal Legend, is that being voiced by Jack Black?
[17:25] <ghst> *find
[17:26] <KimiSleep> Yes, and it looks terrible Lo-Volt
[17:26] <Tre`> http://cdbaby.com/cd/edharrison -- soundtrack so good
[17:28] <Lo-Volt> Yes, Jack Black, the man who 'choked' himself while having sex with two video game consoles for the VGA last year.
[17:29] <Lo-Volt> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bk0YYZYnwE
[17:30] <Tiduz> so i got a €35 off thing
[17:30] <Tiduz> the wait for brazbrue begins
[17:31] <DrForester> <KimiSleep> Yes, and it looks terrible Lo-Volt <- Jack black already implies terrible
[17:32] <KimiSleep> Well
[17:32] <Lo-Volt> No, it does.
[17:32] <Orin_WarHammer> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORED
[17:32] <KimiSleep> There is absolutly nothing about the game I find appealing
[17:32] <Orin_WarHammer> MYTHIC
[17:32] <Orin_WarHammer> MERGE THE SERVERS
[17:33] <Tre`> stop playing warhammer orin
[17:33] <Tiduz> that prob becuz you only listen to abba

[17:33] <Orin_WarHammer> NUUU
[17:33] <Tre`> I thought you'd be playing the aion beta
[17:33] <Tiduz> orin is hooking up with warhammer chicks now that there are not enough people there
[17:33] <Tiduz> :D
[17:33] <Tre`> there are no warhammer chicks

[18:44] <Tre`> who cares, touchscreens and pretty colors
[18:45] <Shuri> it needs an ethernet cable.. wat
[18:45] <Shuri> i need to read up on ableton
[18:45] <Shuri> i tried the demo but hmMmm
[18:45] <Shuri> im just not feeling the interface

[18:46] <KimiSleep> I'll save and do it I suppose.

[18:46] <Tre`> are you going to get that akai controller for ableton?
[18:47] <Tre`> oh
[18:47] * WasabiKing has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[18:47] <Tre`> isn't that punisher game ass
[18:47] <Shuri> yeah, it feels like a ut3 total convertion
[18:47] <Shuri> but its amusing!
[18:47] <Shuri> when you kill, you get upgrades on your guns, and so on
[18:47] <Shuri> you can equip your character with 'powers' like..running super fast, healing, etc
[18:47] <Tre`> I think you just like bad games
[18:48] <Shuri> i hate you :(
[18:48] <Shuri> it's 10$!

[18:48] <Tre`> not yet

[18:49] <Tre`> pass
[18:49] <sprusk> ugh fuck that
[18:49] <sprusk> what is the point of that?
[18:50] <Tre`> to punish you
[18:50] <Tre`> XP penalties in MMOs are so awful.
[18:50] <syllogism> not sure if i'm interested though, too much like cs ;(
[18:50] <sprusk> well yeah, obviously, but still surely there are better ways of punishing players that doesnt make me want to throw my computer
[18:50] <Tre`> and it's a korean MMO
[18:50] <Tre`> so you know every point of XP you have to grind the fuck out of for
[18:50] <Tre`> syll:  it's...not much like CS at all
[18:50] <Tre`> besides having bullet guns
[18:51] <sprusk> barfola
[18:51] <Tre`> the core gameplay mode is capture the flag
[18:51] <syllogism> ok too much like quake
[18:51] <Tre`> that's an even worse comparison :-p
[18:51] <syllogism> too much like a game i dont like
[18:52] <Tre`> you pretty much covered all FPSs there
[18:52] <Tre`> between quake and CS
[18:52] <syllogism> I like team based gamemodes that dont involve flags
[18:52] <Tre`> CTF is the bestest
[18:53] <Tiduz> rofl
[18:53] <Shuri> TF2..
[18:53] <Tiduz> 12 gb in 1 hr dled
[18:53] <Tiduz> noice
[18:53] <Tre`> oh, it's not quite ctf
[18:54] <DrForester> need more game modes like seige mode in Tribes 2
[18:54] <Tre`> there's only one "flag" for both teams
[18:54] <Tre`> interestinggg
[18:54] <sprusk> aaaaaaaaaaaaa new perfume album next weeeeeeeeeeek
[18:54] <sprusk> nomnomnom
[18:54] <syllogism> that already makes it better
[18:54] <Tre`> CTF is the best FPS game mode ever
[18:54] <Tre`> http://www.neotokyohq.com/neotokyo_noob_hints.html
[18:54] <Kabouter> This is true Tre`
[18:55] <syllogism> I suppose I might like playing ctf with like gaffers only
[18:56] <syllogism> or goons
[18:57] <Shuri> shadowrun is all about ctf
[18:57] <Kabouter> Shadowrun is all about the suck

[18:58] <Kabouter> That's Gothic 3
[18:58] <sprusk> hahaha oh right
[18:58] <Kabouter> Two Worlds is the one with the bizarre voice acting
[18:58] <sprusk> gothic 3
[18:58] <syllogism> Valve has told Eurogamer that pre-orders for Left 4 Dead 2 are twice what they were at this stage last time, despite the internet backlash and boycott threats.
[18:58] <syllogism> bubu boycott

[19:00] <Kabouter> None, even Euro RPG's are too awesome for Japanese people to handle
[19:00] <sprusk> probably also 5
[19:00] <Kabouter> And that's saying something
[19:00] <sprusk> theres a nerd for everything here
[19:00] <DrForester> bullshit, there are no euro rpgs....
[19:00] <DrForester> i dont beleive you

[19:02] <Kabouter> But man, I do love Two Worlds for one thing. The amazing fact that there is a specific skill in the game where you learn to dismount enemies using a halberd. And there isn't a mounted enemy in the entire game.

[00:11] <Tre`> they did that?
[00:11] <Alone-Jinrai> lol
[00:11] <Tre`> hahahaha
[00:11] <syllogism> yes
[00:11] <Alone-Jinrai> its that bad?
[00:11] <syllogism> it's literally the same episode
[00:12] <Tre`> Haruhi fanbots deserve it
[00:12] <jman2050> I'm not kidding
[00:12] <Alone-Jinrai> amazimg... the haruhi novels were stellar
[00:12] <jman2050> this is just amazing
[00:12] <Tre`> fuck them and their shitty dance
[00:12] <jman2050> kyoani are the greatest dicks
[00:12] <syllogism> i hope the dvd with the episodes will cost the usual
[00:12] <Alone-Jinrai> the usual 25 for 4 eps?
[00:12] * Danj is now known as Danj_sleep
[00:12] <Alone-Jinrai> =P
[00:14] <Hitokage> haha
[00:14] <jman2050> I like Haruhi and all, but I can't help by applaud
[00:14] <Hitokage> if Kyoto Animation is seriously going "fuck you" to haruhi fans, that's hilarious
[00:14] <jman2050> this is just downright brilliant
[00:15] <syllogism> jman2050: apparently it's not even ower yet
[00:15] <syllogism> over
[00:15] <jman2050> this is the greatest money-milking scheme since the Nintendo Wii
[00:15] <jman2050> yeah
[00:15] <ddk_RIP_MJ> holy shit@ governmnet waste
[00:15] <Alone-Jinrai> did the director change or something?
[00:15] <jman2050> there's AT LEAST a fifth episode of this
[00:15] <newt> What is?
[00:15] <ddk_RIP_MJ> they're spending $18M to redesign recover.gov
[00:15] <jman2050> rumor is it's going to be six in all
[00:15] <ddk_RIP_MJ> i will fucking do it for HALF that price
[00:15] <newt> Wait wait wait
[00:15] <newt> of this Endless Eight thing?
[00:15] <ddk_RIP_MJ> give me $9M and i will do it
[00:15] <jman2050> yes
[00:15] <Alone-Jinrai> ddk: lol
[00:15] <ddk_RIP_MJ> do not spend $18m
[00:15] <newt> no fucking way
[00:16] <jman2050> I'm not kidding
[00:16] <newt> I was so disappointed with this episode
[00:16] <jman2050> this is amazing
[00:16] <newt> Last time felt like enough
[00:16] <syllogism> how could you be disappointed
[00:16] <syllogism> you knew it was going to be the same thing again
[00:16] * TEEEPO has joined #GA
[00:16] <newt> Well I thought it was going to be the conclusion
[00:16] <newt> I can't wait to see what wacky masks Yuki tries on next! What is there to expect in this arc except some resolve
[00:16] <Alone-Jinrai> conclusion? the first season only covered 1/3 of the story
[00:17] <newt> I mean conclusion to the whole endless eight things
[00:17] <newt> thing*
[00:17] <Alone-Jinrai> they have plenty of room to develop
[00:17] <syllogism> the best part is haruhi fans waited for this "new" series so much
[00:17] * ddk_RIP_MJ has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[00:17] <newt> Aren't there supposed to be 28 episodes? That means they have like 10 new eps left?
[00:17] <jman2050> they're spending 6 episodes
[00:17] <Hitokage> well, anime studios frequently do the fuck you dance, but I don't remember one being honest about it
[00:17] <jman2050> to do 1/4th of a novel
[00:18] <newt> I don't mind
[00:18] <syllogism> not 10 new ones
[00:18] <newt> But is the Endless Eight plot going to be wrapped up soon
[00:18] <syllogism> isn't it the new episodes + old episodes = 28
[00:18] <newt> Yes
[00:18] <newt> But they did 10 old episodes already I think?
[00:18] <newt> and 4 new ones? so 10 new ones left (+4 old ones)
[00:19] <Sea_Manky> Wouldn't an arc called "Endless Eight" imply eight LOL RPT episodes?
[00:19] <newt> eight oh god
[00:20] <jman2050> that would be amazing Manky
[00:20] <Somnia> lol @ this giant bomb endurance run for the matrix online
[00:21] <newt> So how do you know it's not gonna get wrapped up next ep?
[00:21] <jman2050> we don't
[00:21] <jman2050> and that's the hilarious part
[00:21] <newt> Argh, is this a fucking rating scheme
[00:22] <newt> I want to know the damn conclusion already but I aint gonna read the novels after I waited so long for this "season" and watched these three repeats already
[00:22] <Hitokage> bilking otaku is perfectly legal
[00:22] <Hitokage> and ethical
[00:23] <dead> its supposed to be 6 episodes
[00:23] <jman2050> also I wonder how the fansubbers are reacting
[00:23] <Hitokage> less money to buy weapons to harm actual members of society
[00:23] <jman2050> this has got to be either the easiest or most infuriating sub job ever
[00:23] <newt> Well it's not like they say the exact same things
[00:24] <Hitokage> are all scenes of equal timing?
[00:24] <newt> the sub I watched for the latest one was a little crappy
[00:24] <Hitokage> just reuse the sub file
[00:24] <newt> I do wonder how this was done in the novel-- don't tell me htough
[00:25] <newt> I just hope the fan translations aren't shit, and when reading a novel you can't even be sure of the accuracy
[00:25] <dead> ill say it anyways
[00:25] <dead> based on the novel

[01:04] <Kab_Laptop> Timur's tomb is protected by a slab of jade in which are carved the words in Arabic: "When I rise, the World will Tremble". [22] It is said that when Gerasimov exhumed the body, an additional inscription inside the casket was found reading "Whosoever opens my tomb shall unleash an invader more terrible than I."[23] In any case, within hours after Gerasimov had begun the exhumation, Nazi Germany launched Operation Barbarossa, its invasion of the U.S.S.
[01:04] <Kab_Laptop> Now that's a serious tomb
[01:06] <Kab_Laptop> Fitting of such a man, wikipedia says the guy managed to slaughter 17 million people in his lifetime...in the 14th century.

[01:15] <jakehk> While exploring you might see an NPC spontaneously rob another, then in the middle of the act a mountain lion might pounce on the criminal.

[01:15] <ZombieSupaStar> its software is so much better than that pile of itunes shit
[01:16] <ZombieSupaStar> itunes makes me feel like im on a p3 500mhz again i swear

[01:18] <Hitokage> not at 100% performance, but they do it
[01:18] <ZombieSupaStar> but i guess DOSBox is running a DOS OS....
[01:19] <Hitokage> win7's xp mode is going to be vm-based
[01:19] <jett> hey a question PC users, will running a game at 720p on a 1080p monitor look like complete garbage?
[01:19] <Hitokage> no
[01:20] <jett> o rly
[01:20] <Hitokage> just use driver scaling and you should be ok
[01:20] <Hitokage> won't be perfect, but passable
[01:20] <EviLore> 10 minutes
[01:20] <thesoapster> i don't think games run at 16:9 usually, do they?
[01:20] <jett> driver scaling huh, how does that work
[01:20] <thesoapster> or if your monitor is 16:9 do most allow 16:9 resolutions
[01:21] <EviLore> every game supports 16:9 these days
[01:21] <thesoapster> ah. just have to have the right screen then?
[01:21] <EviLore> yep
[01:21] <kassatsu> jake: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHgA3hY5EVQ you watch that?
[01:21] <jett> soapster: i guess but most monitors don't say on their spec sheet
[01:21] <Hitokage> jett: option in control panel... the video card will always output your monitor's native resolution, but render other resolutions as it would normally and scale up for you
[01:21] <jett> just the native res
[01:22] <jett> hito: i see thanks
[01:22] <Hitokage> helpful for monitors like mine which do not have a proper scaler
[01:22] <jett> hito: but what if i use a 720p ps3 game with the monitor, then i'm fucked aren't i? :P
[01:22] <Hitokage> 640x480 gets stretched out to full size
[01:22] <Hitokage> without driver scaling
[01:23] <Hitokage> uh, tvs should at least handle various HD formats cleanly
[01:23] <jett> it's not a tv, just a pc monitor
[01:23] <thesoapster> my 1680x1050 plays 720p 360 content just fine
[01:24] <thesoapster> it's a dell monitor.
[01:24] * Hitokage shrugs
[01:24] <Hitokage> dell lcds have scalers afaik
[01:24] <jett> soapster: oh yeah that's cause the 360 is good at scaling
[01:24] <jett> ps3 scales nothing
[01:24] <thesoapster> hm.
[01:24] <EviLore> http://www.abjecthubris.com/images/zombieron.jpg  promotional photo photoshopping is so overboard
[01:24] <minty> jett: didn't you get a hdtv
[01:25] <Hitokage> OMG BIG BEN IS SLANTED SOMETHING MUST BE UP
[01:25] <thesoapster> LOL
[01:25] <jett> minty: nah, i've decided to get a 1080p pc monitor
[01:25] <minty> smh
[01:26] <thesoapster> EviLore: i love the look on the guy's face (i want to say peter but i really don't know their names for the most part) in the background. with that striped shirt and look he almost looks like a prisoner 
[01:26] * Danj is now known as Danj_sleep
[01:26] <kassatsu> ps3 did better than i thought
[01:26] <EviLore> hah, instant posting of NPD this month.  first time
[01:26] <kassatsu> ps2 almost beat it though

[01:27] <Sea_Manky> speaking of ice cream, I need to think up a new flavor to make tonight
[01:27] <minty> wow, no punch out?
[01:27] <Hitokage> Sea_Manky: nutella

[01:28] <minty> fighnite 4 did aight
[01:28] <Hitokage> for shame, good sir
[01:28] <jakehk> kassatsu
[01:28] <Sea_Manky> I don't think I've ever had nutella, as a matter of fact
[01:28] <jakehk> i didnt think it was funny
[01:28] <minty> nutella ain't bad
[01:28] <kingkitty> minty nutella
[01:28] <kassatsu> i thought the orginal vid with the kid in the car was good though
[01:28] <Sea_Manky> every so often I see it at the store and think, I should grab a jar, but then I don't
[01:30] <EGM92> fucking fuck fuck :L@
[01:31] <minty> something broke again?
[01:31] <Hitokage> Sea_Manky: well, you'll just have to overcome that
[01:31] <EGM92> No
[01:31] <EGM92> girlfriend bought a fucking car without even consulting me :@
[01:31] <kingkitty> :Q
[01:31] <BJ33> That EA Sports Active thing sold well?
[01:31] <Sea_Manky> I mean, I like hazelnuts, I like chocolate, but I can't think of how I'd use it other than just eating it out of the jar.
[01:31] <jakehk> what kinda man are you
[01:31] <jman2050> lol COndushit
[01:32] <minty> what kinda car?
[01:32] <Hitokage> Sea_Manky: put it on any bread product
[01:32] <Sea_Manky> I'm certainly not going to make a sandwich with it.
[01:32] <jakehk> jetta prolly
[01:32] <kingkitty> why not?
[01:32] <kingkitty> everything is better in a sandwich
[01:32] <minty> if she used her own money then who cares
[01:32] <Hitokage> it's not really sandwich stuff as much as a spread
[01:32] <EGM92> an old Porche
[01:32] <jakehk> lol
[01:32] <kassatsu> No Conduit? o_O Unexpected. <- this junior has much to learn

[10:01] * Set by EviLore on Thu Jul 16 21:21:26
[10:02] <nerbo> Kevin Nealon still does appearances
[10:02] <nerbo> though he still has a career
[10:02] <nerbo> and something to promote
[10:02] <HadesGigas> yeah Nealon is above him
[10:02] <HadesGigas> Colin Quinn is above him!
[10:02] <Unison_> bzzzzt
[10:02] <nerbo> haha
[10:02] <nerbo> harsh
[10:02] <Unison_> Victoria Jackson
[10:02] <nerbo> but true
[10:02] <HadesGigas> haha is she still alive?
[10:02] <Unison_> yes she is a nutty republican blogger now
[10:03] <Unison_> http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/vjackson/2009/07/07/ignorance-is-bliss/#more-178482
[10:03] <HadesGigas> Jackson continues to perform stand up, often appearing with other ex-SNL players (most frequently Joe Piscopo and Don Novello as "Father Guido Sarducci"
[10:03] <HadesGigas> ouch
[10:03] <HadesGigas> ok
[10:03] <HadesGigas> she's lower
[10:03] <Unison_> she compares obama to hitler
[10:03] <Unison_> and says health care reform is euthanasia
[10:03] <Unison_> haha
[10:03] <nerbo> gotta sell ads somehow!
[10:03] <Tre``> Colin Quinn is actually funny
[10:03] <Tre``> or rather
[10:04] <Tre``> he has good material
[10:04] <Unison_> I’d been wondering why the liberals are so passionate about this Health Care thing.  It couldn’t be because they actually care about sick, poor people.  If they did, they would visit hospitals, and give ten percent of their gross salaries to Compassion International and World Vision, like us stupid church go-ers do. Biden gave $ 62 to charity last year.
[10:04] <Tre``> he has shit execution, though
[10:04] <HadesGigas> if only he could tell the jokes without stammering
[10:04] * David has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[10:04] <Tre``> exactly
[10:04] <Tre``> he tries to do the denis leary thing
[10:04] <Tre``> but doesn't have the mouth for it
[10:04] <Unison_> No, there’s gotta be a catch.  I guess this question was sitting in my brain and during my sleep, my brain was working on it, because when I suddenly awoke at 3 a.m.  I had the answer. Euthanasia!
[10:04] <Unison_> LOL
[10:04] * Tre`` is now known as Tre`
[10:04] <nerbo> liberals already do give `10% of their gross to sicka nd poor
[10:04] <Unison_> Obama legally kills babies and now he can legally kill Grandmas!
[10:04] <HadesGigas> i liked that show he had on comedy central for a bit, though half the time the other people were crap
[10:04] <nerbo> because THEY FUCKING PAY TAXES
[10:05] <bjork-wtf> best execution after Richard Pryor is Mitch Hedberg
[10:05] <nerbo> stupid douchd
[10:05] <bjork-wtf> he makes unfunny shit hilarious just in how he says it
[10:05] <Unison_> so yeah
[10:05] <Unison_> Victoria Jackson loses
[10:05] <Unison_> Dana Carvey can breathe easy
[10:05] <Unison_> haha
[10:06] <HadesGigas> Well of the people who still appear on tv sometimes, he's still the lowest
[10:06] <Unison_> she's just on fox news
[10:06] <Unison_> maybe that doesnt count?
[10:06] <Unison_> haha
[10:06] <HadesGigas> is she really? seems a bit too crazy for even them 
[10:09] <Unison_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR__8jl7PM8
[10:10] <Unison_> as if such a thing were possible
[10:10] <HadesGigas> she read it twice!
[10:10] <HadesGigas> lol
[10:10] <Unison_> she calls obama a communist in like 2 seconds
[10:10] <Unison_> haha
[10:10] <Unison_> hahaha
[10:10] <warcock-SC> OBAMA IS A COMMUNIST
[10:11] <HadesGigas> haha even O'Reilly is like "umm he's not a communist"
[10:11] <Unison_> lol
[10:11] * priz has quit IRC (Quit: )
[10:11] <Unison_> she looks so confused
[10:11] <Unison_> haha
[10:11] <nerbo> I love how these crazy Republicans are yelling Communist
[10:12] * soakrates has joined #GA
[10:12] <nerbo> but when Bush hands out billions or trillions
[10:12] <nerbo> it's just good sense
[10:12] <Unison_> lol
[10:12] <jakehk> Milan Considering Swoop For Juventus’ David Trezeguet - Report
[10:12] <soakrates> Tre: you got SF4 for PC?
[10:12] <warcock-SC> hands out trillions...
[10:12] <warcock-SC> jake: oh fuck offffff
[10:12] <nerbo> somehow Bush's last 6 months on office is just erased from memory
[10:12] <nerbo> those bank bailouts were all Dem
[10:13] <Tre`> soak:  nope
[10:13] <warcock-SC> yeah but there is a fucking gap between 2-3 hundred billions and a trillion
[10:13] <HadesGigas> but yeah cable news doesn't count, they'll put any crazy person on tv to fill time
[10:13] <Tre`> decided not to get it because there was no crossplatform
[10:14] <Hitokage> Henry Paulson is shedding a tear
[10:14] <HadesGigas> so Victoria Jackson is still more in the Joe Piscopo category
[10:14] * Axord has quit IRC (Quit: Killed by Slime)
[10:14] <warcock-SC> is sf4 a hardware hog on pc?
[10:15] <Unison_> not at all
[10:15] <warcock-SC> :o
[10:15] <Unison_> runs smooth on anything modern
[10:15] <Unison_> very scalable
[10:15] * Axord has joined #GA
[10:15] <soakrates> aw you bastige
[10:15] <soakrates> my roommate got it, heh
[10:16] <Tre`> I can't justify buying a game I already own with nothing new
[10:16] <Tre`> even still has the DLC costumes
[10:16] <Tre`> gtfo capcom
[10:17] <warcock-SC> meh
[10:17] <soakrates> *shrug*
[10:17] <soakrates> 40 bucks is a pretty good deal
[10:17] <soakrates> but yeah
[10:17] <warcock-SC> it is if you dont already own it....
[10:18] <warcock-SC> tre: maybe you can haxor it
[10:18] <soakrates> you can
[10:19] <HadesGigas> there are custom costumes already
[10:19] <soakrates> there's a shitload of vids of characters with swapped movesets
[10:19] <soakrates> some are hilarious
[10:19] <warcock-SC> and play on the network?
[10:19] <Tre`> Evo in just a few more hours
[10:19] <HadesGigas> you can see the custom costumes on your screen, they see the normal one
[10:19] <Tre`> dogface commentating
[10:20] * Kab_Laptop has joined #GA
[10:20] <Unison_> you can have diddy kong sakura
[10:20] <warcock-SC> fuck 1 more hour
[10:20] <warcock-SC> ghey
[10:20] <warcock-SC> i hope i dont get addicted to this shit
[10:20] <soakrates> oh well, at least I have another version I can dick around with
[10:21] <Tre`> word
[10:21] <soakrates> not that I play online anymore anyway
[10:21] <Tre`> if I pick it up I'll holla at you
[10:21] <HadesGigas> diddy kong sakura is kinda freaky, I don't think anything will look weirder than Longchu from SSBB character swapping, though
[10:21] <Tre`> though I'm deep into BB at the moment
[10:21] <Tre`> unless I pick up KOFXII or MVC2, this'll probably hold me until tekken 6
[10:21] <soakrates> I still haven't played a single match against a human player in BB
[10:21] <happy_phantom> BB <3
[10:21] <soakrates> heh, MVC2
[10:21] <Tre`> doesn't norcal have a solid BB scene?
[10:21] <warcock-SC> MVC 2
[10:22] <soakrates> I think?
[10:22] <Tre`> get out there and level up!
[10:22] <soakrates> but everyone who plays FGs in NorCal is gone right now
[10:22] <Tre`> oh
[10:22] <Tre`> right
[10:22] <Tre`> yeah hahaha
[10:22] <warcock-SC> ?

[10:22] <soakrates> or they're not playing BB because they wanna focus on something else
[10:22] <warcock-SC> where is it LV?
[10:22] <Tre`> yeah
[10:22] <warcock-SC> BB HAS NO MONEY!11
[10:22] <soakrates> or they have the PS3 ver :/
[10:23] <Tre`> PS3 ftw
[10:23] <warcock-SC> tre: what hotel do you know?
[10:23] <Tre`> I wonder if most tekken players will be on PS3
[10:23] <Tre`> because they already have one from T5DR
[10:23] <happy_phantom> oh shit EVO starts tomorrow doesn't it?
[10:23] <Tre`> warcock:  Rio
[10:23] <Tre`> yes

[10:42] <OnkelC> SUCKER IS HUGE
[10:42] <Kab_Laptop> It is
[10:42] <Kab_Laptop> I'm watching a movie now on my laptop's 14" screen lol
[10:43] <Kab_Laptop> Quite the difference :P
[10:43] * soakrates has joined #GA
[10:43] <OnkelC> it's even a 959 instead of the 956 i ordered
[10:43] * krates has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[10:43] <Hitokage> I watched the last GSP fight, and while his takedown ability was impressive what he did afterward wasn't
[10:43] <OnkelC> the pioneer will feel like a 14" from now on lol
[10:43] <Hitokage> so I get the impression UFC fans don't know better
[10:43] <Kab_Laptop> Haha
[10:44] <OnkelC> hitokage, i missed you in the recent "melon" thread, lots of hawaiian pizza hate spread there
[10:44] <bjork-wtf> onkel's "before" tv is the same we had at one of our stores
[10:44] <bjork-wtf> real nice tv
[10:44] <OnkelC> yup, i like it a lot, still hold up great after 5 years
[10:44] <OnkelC> but the samsung was too good of a deal to be passed
[10:45] <OnkelC> 50% off of retail
[10:45] <Hitokage> OnkelC: not everyone can be on the right side of the bell curve
[10:46] <OnkelC> the bell tolleded for you
[10:46] <OnkelC> ;)
[10:46] <Kab_Laptop> Wow 50% off
[10:46] <Kab_Laptop> TV's must just not be selling at all
[10:47] <OnkelC> nope, pre-IFA stock clearance
[10:47] <OnkelC> new models to be announced there
[10:47] <OnkelC> and the 959 wasn't a volume model
[10:47] <OnkelC> i was glad to get one of them
[10:47] <OnkelC> glad=lucky
[10:48] <Kab_Laptop> I see
[10:49] <warcock-SC> egm?
[10:49] <soakrates> hrm
[10:49] <soakrates> timing seems different
[10:49] <soakrates> not sure if it's because there's more or less input lag on PC

[10:54] <Bob_Coffee> sf4 feels fine for me. what controler are you using?
[10:54] <soakrates> TE stick
[10:54] <soakrates> it's not a big adjustment though
[10:55] <warcock-SC> actually shoulda waited for steam
[10:55] <warcock-SC> coulda played keyboard
[10:55] <warcock-SC> and sf4 isnt very input intensive imo
[10:55] <soakrates> you can use the keyboard
[10:55] <soakrates> but I wouldn't anyway
[10:55] <soakrates> input intensive meaning....
[10:56] <warcock-SC> well you dont need to do 40x combos or CCs
[10:56] <Bob_Coffee> which TE tree sixty or ps3?
[10:56] <warcock-SC> which is hard on keyboard
[10:56] <warcock-SC> imo
[10:56] <Bob_Coffee> i heard the ps3 sticks act werid on pcs.
[10:56] <soakrates> 360
[10:56] <warcock-SC> rly
[10:56] <soakrates> but it's not the stick
[10:56] <soakrates> it's just the timing
[10:56] <soakrates> probably because my TV has a bit of input lag
[10:56] <soakrates> but I'm not positive
[10:56] <Bob_Coffee> im using a ps2 to usb converter and anything i can do on ps3/360 i can do on the pc. my only problem is fucking ex shoryukening, when im supposed to do an ultra, with ryu.
[10:57] <soakrates> I dunno some characters have some crazy long combos
[10:58] <soakrates> but when talking about inputs, you also have to factor in focus cancels and shit
[10:58] <Bob_Coffee> i still havent gotten down focus cancels just yet.
[10:58] <soakrates> and characters with multi-part specials
[10:58] <Bob_Coffee> ive only been able to get into the meat of SF4 with the pc version.
[10:58] <soakrates> Bob_Coffee: what's your Windows Live ID?>
[10:58] <Bob_Coffee> since i dont have ps tripple or 360.
[10:58] <Bob_Coffee> soakrates: Bob_Coffee64
[10:59] <warcock-SC> lol
[10:59] <warcock-SC> yeah
[10:59] <warcock-SC> i get that on controller too bob
[11:00] * EGM92 has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[11:00] <warcock-SC> fadc was challenging on controller infight to me
[11:00] <warcock-SC> i didnt play very long though
[11:00] <soakrates> how do I edit my GFWL profile?
[11:00] <OnkelC> brb setup
[11:00] * OnkelC has quit IRC (Quit: Verlassend)
[11:00] <Bob_Coffee> another thing i noticed about SF4, is say if you hold down the button, do a motion, like hadoken, let go of the button, it'll do the motion.
[11:00] <soakrates> that's in a lot of games
[11:01] <soakrates> the "negative edge"
[11:01] <soakrates> letting go of the button also counts as an input
[11:01] <Bob_Coffee> ive never noticed it in SF before tho.
[11:01] <warcock-SC> its there i think
[11:01] <warcock-SC> but ive never counsciously used it
[11:02] <Bob_Coffee> ill say this tho, otherwise sf4 is pretty good, runs silky smooth for me at 1440x900, with my shit ass old system.
[11:03] <warcock-SC> wow
[11:03] <warcock-SC> im surprised
[11:03] <warcock-SC> the game isnt gorgeous or anything
[11:03] <warcock-SC> i just thought it woulda been a bitch to run
[11:04] <warcock-SC> dunno i think lost planet tainted me
[11:04] <soakrates> I had to lower the settings on my friend's comp
[11:04] <warcock-SC> tre: you still awake?
[11:07] * EGM92 has joined #GA
[11:08] <warcock-SC> egm
[11:08] <warcock-SC> hi
[11:08] <soakrates> I should pick up another character
[11:09] <warcock-SC> ryu 4 life
[11:09] <warcock-SC> if i still played and wanted to dedicate some time
[11:09] <warcock-SC> id prolly pick up viper
[11:10] <warcock-SC> seems like tons of fun to play
[11:10] <warcock-SC> egm92
[11:10] <soakrates> yeah, Viper's good too
[11:10] <soakrates> real hard to use though
[11:11] <soakrates> Bison seems kinda fun
[11:11] <Bob_Coffee> viper is strange. lots of mix up with her tho.
[11:12] <Bob_Coffee> Rog is kinda fun to play.
[11:12] <warcock-SC> well i mean what i like about sf4 is that there is alot of familiarity with ssft2
[11:13] <warcock-SC> i imagine bison plays similarly
[11:13] <Bob_Coffee> tricken flowchart fireballers with Ex straght dash punchs. cause that shit parrys the first hit.
[11:13] <warcock-SC> i dislike the parry shit alot
[11:13] <warcock-SC> i barely used it when i played
[11:13] <warcock-SC> like if you do succesful parry a fireball
[11:13] <warcock-SC> if the guy is spamming
[11:14] <warcock-SC> there is no way you can avoid the other one
[11:14] <Nikashi> ...
[11:14] <Nikashi> bob
[11:14] <Nikashi> I was just playing SFIV for the last 2 hours
[11:14] <soakrates> "other" one?
[11:14] <Nikashi> wait
[11:14] <Nikashi> are you MrBob or is that someone else
[11:14] <warcock-SC> like the one after the one you parried
[11:14] <Nikashi> because if so I STILL BEAT YOU IN PAC MAN CE
[11:14] <soakrates> well I mean
[11:14] <warcock-SC> you block
[11:14] <warcock-SC> but hey do you get bar
[11:14] <warcock-SC> for parrying the fireball
[11:14] <soakrates> yeah
[11:14] <Bob_Coffee> no. i am Bob_Coffee64 on winblows live.
[11:14] <warcock-SC> ah ok
[11:14] <Bob_Coffee> i havent been on sf4 today, cept in the morning.
[11:15] <soakrates> you gain revenge meter for absorbing with focus attacks
[11:15] <warcock-SC> kk
[11:15] <soakrates> I don't think you gain regular meter though
[11:15] <Nikashi> I should have invited soak to a match :P
[11:16] <warcock-SC> ud get raped
[11:16] <soakrates> were you playing on PC?
[11:17] * Firestorm has quit IRC (Quit: )
[11:17] <warcock-SC> wtf is this trine shit
[11:17] <warcock-SC> why is it selling
[11:17] <Nikashi> no
[11:17] <warcock-SC> SEX
[11:17] <Nikashi> 360
[11:17] <warcock-SC> css> tf2 and orange box in sales
[11:18] <warcock-SC> THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN
[11:18] <warcock-SC> THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN
[11:18] <warcock-SC> THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN
[11:18] <soakrates> I've been playing TF2 lately
[11:18] <soakrates> it's fun
[11:18] <Bob_Coffee> alright, sleep time.
[11:18] <warcock-SC> its fun
[11:18] <Bob_Coffee> night everyone.
[11:18] <warcock-SC> what class do you use
[11:18] <soakrates> but I almost always play Defense lol
[11:18] * Bob_Coffee is away -( sleep )- at 01:18a -( P:On / L:On )-
[11:18] * Bob_Coffee is now known as Bob_CoffeeAway
[11:18] <warcock-SC> oh
[11:18] <soakrates> Demo/Pyro
[11:18] <warcock-SC> pryo NOOB cannon
[11:18] <soakrates> yeah pretty much
[11:18] <warcock-SC> demo is skill
[11:18] <warcock-SC> im not very good at it
[11:19] <soakrates> sniper is stupid good now
[11:19] <warcock-SC> the only skill class i use is scout
[11:19] <soakrates> with all the updates
[11:19] <warcock-SC> sniper was my best class
[11:19] <warcock-SC> but i got bored of playing it
[11:19] <warcock-SC> its like playing CS with terrible hitboxes 
[11:19] <warcock-SC> i dunno i still find soldier imba
[11:19] <soakrates> I dunno that Demo is skill really
[11:20] <warcock-SC> well sticky is just patience
[11:20] <soakrates> yeah
[11:20] <warcock-SC> but like for the regular grenade launcher
[11:20] <soakrates> there are some neat tricks though
[11:20] <warcock-SC> if you shoot it at the guy
[11:20] <warcock-SC> and it dosent bounce
[11:20] <soakrates> most people just lob with grenades
[11:20] <warcock-SC> it almost one shots
[11:20] <warcock-SC> some people are really adept at that
[11:20] <soakrates> but I try to roll it so that it's less noticeable
[11:20] <warcock-SC> thats hard
[11:20] <soakrates> yeah, I've gotten ok at it
[11:20] <soakrates> but really
[11:21] <warcock-SC> well you spam/roll from a distance
[11:21] <warcock-SC> or corners
[11:21] <soakrates> there's no reason a good player would get hit by one of those things at mid/close range
[11:21] <warcock-SC> yes for most classes
[11:21] <warcock-SC> but soldiers and heavies
[11:21] <warcock-SC> are too slow to run away
[11:21] <warcock-SC> even when the shit bounces
[11:21] <soakrates> pyro or scout = death to a demo if they get close enough
[11:22] <warcock-SC> with soldiers you are almost better off jumping towards them and spaming rockets on the floor
[11:22] <soakrates> yeah
[11:22] <soakrates> or melee, heh
[11:22] <warcock-SC> scouts are fucking gay
[11:22] <soakrates> scout is retarded
[11:22] <warcock-SC> when you play demo
[11:22] <warcock-SC> you get that impression
[11:22] <warcock-SC> but once you play them
[11:22] <warcock-SC> the scout is incredibly vulnerable
[11:22] <warcock-SC> to alot of shit
[11:22] <soakrates> I know scout is hard to play
[11:22] <warcock-SC> yeah they are fucking stupid
[11:22] <soakrates> but man in some situations, they're stupid good
[11:22] <soakrates> like against a pyro
[11:22] <warcock-SC> when you play demo/engy/medic
[11:23] <soakrates> just move left and right and shoot
[11:23] <soakrates> don't even have to aim
[11:23] <warcock-SC> yeah or stay at a distance
[11:23] <warcock-SC> and pistol you
[11:23] <warcock-SC> you cant catch up
[11:23] <warcock-SC> so as pyro you take your shot gun out
[11:23] <soakrates> yeah, I just run away most of the time
[11:23] <warcock-SC> and hope he makes a mistake lol
[11:23] <warcock-SC> yeah smart
[11:23] <soakrates> you're just wasting time, really
[11:23] <warcock-SC> ditto 
[11:23] <warcock-SC> but THEORETICALLY
[11:24] <warcock-SC> i think a good sniper is the best class
[11:24] <soakrates> if a scout is trying to get into a firefight with you, he's probably trying to distract you, heh
[11:24] <warcock-SC> cuz you can just headshot everything if you got insane aim
[11:24] <warcock-SC> but the damn hitboxes...
[11:24] <soakrates> sniper is so stupid
[11:24] <soakrates> you don't even need headshots to rack up kills now
[11:24] <warcock-SC> yeah but how often do you encouter game breaking snipers
[11:24] <soakrates> because the bow does so much fucking damage
[11:24] <warcock-SC> yeah bow is stupid
[11:25] <warcock-SC> its just spam
[11:25] <warcock-SC> on choke points
[11:25] <soakrates> bow + jarate
[11:25] <warcock-SC> dont even aim
[11:25] <warcock-SC> just prefire
[11:25] <warcock-SC> and go back to cover
[11:25] <warcock-SC> come out
[11:25] <warcock-SC> loop
[11:25] <warcock-SC> mehhhhh
[11:25] <soakrates> yeah
[11:25] <warcock-SC> the GAME IS BROKEN
[11:25] <warcock-SC> it just also happens to be terribly fun
[11:25] <soakrates> although I laugh when I see a heavy with like five arrows in him
[11:25] <warcock-SC> so i just enjoy myself and take it with a grain of salt
[11:26] <soakrates> I dunno, TF2 seems fairly balanced
[11:26] <soakrates> no truly useless classes
[11:26] <warcock-SC> while this is true
[11:26] <soakrates> but it's really annoying sometimes
[11:26] <soakrates> actually I take that back
[11:26] <warcock-SC> some strategies are really hard to counter
[11:26] <soakrates> it is NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE to win on some maps as blue
[11:26] <warcock-SC> llawlalwl
[11:27] <warcock-SC> uber is gay, there is a counter now
[11:27] <warcock-SC> ive never seen it really work in practice though
[11:27] <warcock-SC> sandman can stun uber
[11:27] <warcock-SC> but like you get 5 seconds
[11:27] <soakrates> honestly, I think 15 seconds should be the minimum respawn time for defense
[11:27] <warcock-SC> hmm depends on the server
[11:27] <soakrates> sandman is pure luck a lot of the time
[11:27] <warcock-SC> you can change that if you a host a lan game
[11:27] <warcock-SC> yeah huh i find it hard to aim 
[11:27] <warcock-SC> unless you sneak up and get close up
[11:28] <soakrates> but there's that one map, can't remember what it's called
[11:28] <soakrates> with the long L-shaped alleyway
[11:28] <warcock-SC> meh dunno 
[11:28] <soakrates> that map should be banned in competitive play lol
[11:28] <warcock-SC> actually im pretty much in love with the original maps
[11:28] <warcock-SC> like granary
[11:28] <warcock-SC> hydro
[11:28] <warcock-SC> and the like
[11:28] <warcock-SC> goldrush is ok
[11:29] <warcock-SC> 2fort is fucking awful
[11:29] <soakrates> unless you have a scout halfway to the second point after capping the first point
[11:29] <warcock-SC> and im usually a fan of simplicity
[11:29] <soakrates> blue's chance of winning is like 10%, if that
[11:29] <warcock-SC> lolol
[11:29] <soakrates> that's why blue gets like 20 minutes to capture it
[11:29] <soakrates> and still almost never does lol
[11:29] <soakrates> so retarded
[11:29] <warcock-SC> maybe its just a case of you getting stuck with the assy team, but yeah valve is known to make terribly imbalanced maps
[11:30] <soakrates> as long as your engineers aren't six your olds, you are almost guaranteed to win
[11:30] <warcock-SC> hahahahah
[11:30] <soakrates> six *year olds
[11:30] <warcock-SC> spy is hard to play
[11:30] <warcock-SC> its actually pretty legit
[11:30] <warcock-SC> i fucking hate them
[11:30] <soakrates> yeah, but worth it if you can make it work
[11:30] <warcock-SC> i thought they were ridiculously gratuitous 
[11:30] <soakrates> sapping one sentry can make a huge difference
[11:30] <warcock-SC> but after trying i take that back
[11:31] <warcock-SC> play spy if you hate snipers lolz
[11:31] <soakrates> heh, yeah
[11:31] <warcock-SC> there is really not alot of things more irritating in gamedom then being backstabbed while you are really focused and scoped as sniper
[11:31] <soakrates> I think spy is really situational though
[11:31] <soakrates> they can either be extremely useful or extremely useless
[11:31] <warcock-SC> yeah but they can turn the tide when thoses situations ariese
[11:32] <warcock-SC> when a deadlock happens its not uncommon that half the team goes spy
[11:32] <warcock-SC> and therefore defeat the whole purpose
[11:32] <warcock-SC> they are great to have in small quantities
[11:32] <warcock-SC> "HAI I GOT THE TURRET"
[11:32] * bjork-wtf is now known as bjork-zzz
[11:32] <warcock-SC> but there is like 2 soldiers and one heavy for the push , hurray!
[11:33] <soakrates> heh yeah
[11:33] <warcock-SC> ive noticed something though
[11:33] <soakrates> that's why I stick to just one class most of the time
[11:33] <warcock-SC> rarely do i ever see a server with one class reallyyy spammed
[11:33] <soakrates> and I play payload almost exclusively now
[11:33] <warcock-SC> pyro is probably the most used class but still its not like exagerated
[11:33] <warcock-SC> payload?
[11:33] <warcock-SC> a map?
[11:33] <soakrates> the one where you push the cart
[11:34] <warcock-SC> ohhh yeah
[11:34] <warcock-SC> i got my mmo player friends to try out
[11:34] <warcock-SC> they loved it
[11:34] <BJ> yappa paa yappa paa iishanten
[11:34] <soakrates> yeah, it's fun
[11:35] <soakrates> even though you die a LOT
[11:35] <soakrates> especially on offense
[11:35] <warcock-SC> yeah but you can still be effective even if you arent a huge fps adept
[11:35] <soakrates> yeah
[11:35] <Nikashi> BJ: Hashagu, koi wa, ike no koi
[11:35] <warcock-SC> i dunno, i think getting raped at a game is a big turn off
[11:35] <warcock-SC> like non stop
[11:35] <warcock-SC> YAY MORE DLING
[11:35] <soakrates> heh, that's why fighting games aren't as popular
[11:35] <warcock-SC> FML
[11:36] <jakehk> that y u dont play fifa?
[11:36] <soakrates> people beat up on their friends and think they're the shit
[11:36] <warcock-SC> lolz
[11:36] <soakrates> then play people who know what they're doing and get reamed
[11:36] <warcock-SC> lolololol
[11:36] <warcock-SC> rude awakening
[11:36] <BJ> :) Nik. hain't seen me no ranmas in a while
[11:37] <Nikashi> I knew that off the top of my heade
[11:37] <Nikashi> head*
[11:37] <Nikashi> pity me
[11:37] <soakrates> you have to be OK with losing a lot to get good at FGs
[11:37] <jakehk> warfag
[11:37] <jakehk> u get the becjham book
[11:37] <warcock-SC> soa: yeah
[11:37] <jakehk> k
[11:37] <BJ> i had to rewind the intro vid I have loaded on youtube
[11:37] <warcock-SC> jake: nah
[11:37] <Nikashi> BJ: At one point I had both verses memories phonetically
[11:38] <warcock-SC> its also difficult to tell what you are doing wrong
[11:38] <Nikashi> mune no, tai wa, dakare tai
[11:38] <warcock-SC> when you get creamed in FGs
[11:38] <Nikashi> wake mo, wakara zu ni
[11:38] <Nikashi> Ranma Ranma de higekureru
[11:38] <BJ> rear foke baroos is the only jappy song I remember much of the words to, just straight memorization
[11:38] <soakrates> well yeah
[11:38] <warcock-SC> its hard to be introspective as to what you are doing while you are playing
[11:38] <warcock-SC> because its fast
[11:38] <Nikashi> Ranma was my first anime series
[11:38] <warcock-SC> whats worse imo though is RTS
[11:38] <warcock-SC> i fucking hate RTS
[11:39] <soakrates> you have to approach them with a real specific mindset
[11:39] <warcock-SC> its too subtle
[11:39] <soakrates> and you have to be able to change strategies really quickly
[11:39] <BJ> Either Ranma, Ippo, or Golden Boy for me but I was like 18 :P
[11:39] <soakrates> but once you get the hang of it, they're a lot of fun
[11:39] <warcock-SC> yeah
[11:40] <warcock-SC> well 3s is the only fighter i got decent at
[11:40] <warcock-SC> and thats pushing it
[11:40] <warcock-SC> but i understood the game to a degree
[11:40] <soakrates> heh well you never really had the chance to give it an honest shot
[11:40] <warcock-SC> stick is a turn off for me tbh
[11:40] <warcock-SC> i bought it being all idealistic
[11:40] <warcock-SC> i tried a few matches and didnt have the balls to stick with it
[11:41] <warcock-SC> but i mean KB is not that bad
[11:41] <soakrates> eh, I think if you stuck with it long enough you'd probably see what you were missing
[11:42] <warcock-SC> yeah
[11:43] <soakrates> but hey some people swear by pad, too *shrug*
[11:49] <soakrates> garrrr ok need to slee
[11:49] <soakrates> p
[11:49] * soakrates has quit IRC (Quit: )
[11:57] * warcock-SC is now known as warcock-nt
[12:01] * Kawasaki has joined #GA
[12:13] <Mandoric> so
[12:13] <Mandoric> any animu fags awake
[12:17] <warcock-nt> 90 percent of anime is terrible
[12:18] <jakehk> 100*
[12:18] <Mandoric> yes, which is exactly why i'm bored and drunk and want to either debate the 10% or shit on the 90%.
[12:19] <BJ> Have you seen Golden Boy?
[12:19] <Mandoric> yes, a decade ago.
[12:20] <BJ> hehe
[12:20] <warcock-nt> IG's medival ghost in the shell anime sucked
[12:20] <warcock-nt> it lacked testosterone
[12:21] <Mandoric> not gonna lie, when I say "let's talk about animu" i basically mean "let's talk about animu i have translated, i don't have time to watch anything else anymore".
[12:21] <Mandoric> so basically szs or mazinger right now.
[12:22] <warcock-nt> ive never heard of either
[12:22] <Mandoric> they're very good 10% material, at least imo
[12:23] <warcock-nt> ive pretty much exclusively enjoyed manime
[12:23] <warcock-nt> im pretty jaded
[12:23] <Mandoric> the first is social satire/commentary with a very unique visual style, the second is a famous director's take on the first-ever super robot with added callouts to Nietzsche
[12:24] <warcock-nt> .
[12:24] <Mandoric> except instead of something like Eva where to add philosophy they make the hero a whiny faggot
[12:25] <warcock-nt> i dunno i didnt know much about philosophy when i watched eva
[12:25] <Mandoric> in Mazinger Kouji just punches the fuck out of stuff whether or not it's his friends or his little brother's girlfriend or so on.
[12:25] * syllogism has joined #GA
[12:25] <warcock-nt> but i do know that xenogears/xenosaga does little more then quote passages or phrases that can be associated to neitzche without anything substantial
[12:25] <warcock-nt> thats pretty cool
[12:26] <warcock-nt> its hideous
[12:26] <warcock-nt> i sadly judge anime by its cover
[12:26] <Mandoric> lol
[12:27] <Mandoric> if you think Nagai art is hideous you're beyond redemption, lol
[12:27] <warcock-nt> i downloaded all of gurren lagann and dumped it into trash bin after watching the OP
[12:27] <Mandoric> it's... different, but it's because he's been drawing this shit for 40 years now and grabbed as much from underground comix as disney-via-tezuka
[12:27] <Mandoric> gurren didn't have really impressive art design
[12:27] <Mandoric> it had big tits
[12:28] <warcock-nt> http://www.brianrobinsonstudios.com/images//MAZINGER%20Z.jpg
[12:28] <warcock-nt> thats pretty ugly
[12:28] <Mandoric> but it was pretty standard apart from the delibelrate decision to be gaudy as fuck
[12:29] <Mandoric> new series looks like, uh
[12:29] <Mandoric> http://www.shin-mazinger.com/
[12:29] <warcock-nt> jake: balotelli is a fucking brat
[12:29] <warcock-nt> i fucking hate him
[12:29] <Mandoric> it's very '70s, but that's the point.
[12:29] <warcock-nt> he made us lose the u21
[12:30] <warcock-nt> fucking N-word
[12:30] <warcock-nt> Mario Balotelli has launched a remarkable challenge to Marcello Lippi. “If he doesn’t pick me for Italy, I’ll go to the World Cup with Ghana.”
[12:30] <warcock-nt> little peice of shit
[12:30] <warcock-nt> ah its not that bad
[12:31] <Mandoric> yeah
[12:31] <Mandoric> there's the foreshortening of the faces
[12:31] <Mandoric> and a lot of deliberate ugliness and a lot of really loltastic hair
[12:31] <Mandoric> but they managed to keep the quirks without actually going back to the low production values
[12:32] <warcock-nt> so wait you fanslate this shit?
[12:32] <Mandoric> yes
[12:32] <warcock-nt> wow
[12:32] <warcock-nt> do you guys get paid?
[12:32] <Mandoric> lolno
[12:32] <warcock-nt> like in donations or shit
[12:33] <warcock-nt> thats pretty dedicated
[12:33] <Mandoric> nope
[12:33] <Mandoric> animu fags are cheapasses
[12:33] <Mandoric> it wouldn't pay enough to be worth it
[12:33] <Mandoric> better to do it for fun
[12:33] <warcock-nt> ahhh
[12:34] <Mandoric> like, uh, the net total trickle in for one group when we jokingly put up a donation box
[12:34] <Mandoric> over the run of a show
[12:34] <Mandoric> wasn't enough to actually cover buying the DVDs
[12:34] <warcock-nt> .
[12:34] <warcock-nt> lol
[12:34] <jakehk> <warcock-nt> he made us lose the u21
[12:34] <jakehk> <warcock-nt> fucking N-word

[12:36] <jakehk> maybe he is
[12:36] <Mandoric> so rather than do it for money, and piracy for money is pretty lol anyway, it's just better to go for artistic self-validation/"my spin on this is watched and appreciated by 10-50 thousand people"
[12:36] <warcock-nt> shut up
[12:36] <warcock-nt> do you get people that argue with you over passages
[12:36] <warcock-nt> im sure you do
[12:37] <warcock-nt> but then why would somebody who masters both languages watch the subs

[12:37] <BJ> Where's GaimeGuy
[12:37] <Mandoric> it's less "masters both languages" and more "picks a favorite for god knows what reason and defends them against all comers"

[12:52] <Mandoric> Scarlet: Does Dq9 get harder?

[12:53] <BJ> hey noss, dq queen
[12:53] <Amir0x> Scarlet doesn't have a DQ game
[12:53] * Amir0x hyperventilates
[12:53] <Noss> sup BJ
[12:53] <Scarlet> i have no money :(
[12:53] <Noss> (does Dq9 exist?)
[12:53] <Amir0x> :(
[12:53] <Scarlet> 8 was the first new one i got at release
[12:53] <Amir0x> Scarlet are you still going through college?
[12:53] <BJ> just playing yahoo pool again, noss
[12:54] <Noss> haha...shit, BJ...I'm thinking of you of the Paul Newman of Yahoo Pool at this point.
[12:54] <BJ> I've beaten this guy 16 times in a row...
[12:54] <Noss> damn, he's a tenatious bastard.
[12:54] <BJ> he won 2 of the the first 3 too
[12:55] <Noss> nice way to hustle him.
[12:55] <Noss> make him think he has a shot..then rape him 16 times in a row...lord
[12:55] <BJ> surprised I haven't scratched the 8 yet
[12:55] <BJ> tryna be a careful critter tho
[12:56] <BJ> I've taken a shine to typing in tard lately, sorry
[12:56] <Noss> in 19 games have you scratched at all?
[12:56] <Noss> and yes, I'm relating real pool to the yahoo pool..no idea
[12:56] <Scarlet> oh nos, i got grandia 2
[12:56] <BJ> just the cue, yeah
[12:56] <Scarlet> not that far in it though
[12:56] <Noss> GASP
[12:56] <Noss> YOU'VE HAD GRANDIA 2 BEFORE, SCARLET!
[12:56] <BJ> Is the game 2 discs or is one just a music soundtrack, I forget
[12:56] <Noss> you are actually playing it, though?  MADNESS
[12:57] <Noss> it's two discs.
[12:57] <Noss> damned scarlet and dh...sniffle..would just laugh and laugh about having Grandia 2 and yet never play.
[12:57] <Noss> oh, they are so evil..sniffle.
[12:57] <Scarlet> no that was lunar 2
[12:57] <Scarlet> i got grandia 2 a couple months ago
[12:57] <Mandoric> a DQ game I have played more of than Scarlet.
[12:57] <Noss> I think it was both, but eh
[12:58] <Mandoric> I am fffffffamazed.
[12:58] <Scarlet> i have no money so i cant buy it
[12:58] <Scarlet> ah damn, i already saved after killing them all
[12:58] <Scarlet> noooooooooooo
[12:58] <Mandoric> Shit, I'm almost tempted to say "take mine, right the natural order of things"
[12:59] <Mandoric> but only one save file hahaha
[12:59] <Scarlet> 8 was the first one i imported 'on time' 
[12:59] <Scarlet> the only others i got AT release were 4 and 5 remakes
[12:59] <Scarlet> so yeah
[12:59] <Scarlet> damnit nos
[12:59] <Scarlet> i dont have a save right before them :(
[13:00] <Noss> cough
[13:00] <Noss> Mandoric is mocking you...not me
[13:00] <Noss> I'm mocking you for grandia and other gamearts games.
[13:00] <Scarlet> so you win this round
[13:00] <Scarlet> maybe you could help me w/ g2..i got stuck for a bit then figured it out then saved and turned it off
[13:01] <Noss> I would be offended if I could help you with g2..come on now..it is a game I like for the story.
[13:01] <Mandoric> actually i think i'm mocking me
[13:01] <Noss> it's easier than pie to play, but you APPARENTLY CAN BEAT A MILLION OMEGA BASTARDS
[13:01] <Noss> sniffle
[13:01] <Noss> all lies...no one can beat that evil spider motherfucker!
[13:01] <Scarlet> well i just didnt go to the right place so i wandered around a dungeon i didnt need to, looking for where to go
[13:01] <Noss> I refuse to believe!
[13:01] <Scarlet> i got milennia in group though! and made some avatars
[13:02] <Noss> see, that's how I like to play rpgs..wandering around in dungeons I don't need to be..I like that crap.
[13:02] <Noss> oh...oh..aw..oh...sigh.
[13:02] <Scarlet> well i thought i missed something
[13:02] <Noss> sniffle...scarlet...finally...knows...millenia..hehe
[13:02] <Scarlet> i just had to talk to the innkeeper or something
[13:03] <Noss> ok, you have made me happy Scarlet.  You finally understand my Millenia references from years and years ago.
[13:03] <Scarlet> im just playing p4 right now, so its kinda boring i imagine
[13:03] <Noss> I shall never play a persona game ever again...so I hope you enjoy
[13:03] <Noss> p3 was more than enough.
[13:03] <Noss> both in learning about historical references and godawful tired gameplay
[13:03] <BJ> Are you writing anything for P4? Seems you're playing it a ton
[13:04] <Scarlet> no, im just playing it on that stream thing
[13:04] <Scarlet> i did metroid prime earlier
[13:04] <Scarlet> will be more fun when im not playing superlong game
[13:04] <BJ> Do Marble Madness NES
[13:04] <BJ> Six minutes
[13:04] <Noss> (but yea, I'm glad that scarlet actually knows of Millenia...she is a cute redhead damnit..and I try and throw cute redheads of gaming to scarlet as much as I can)
[13:04] <Scarlet> i cant play it on nes, its really awkward
[13:04] <BJ> Maybe even fewer...
[13:05] <Scarlet> i beat it on amiga though
[13:05] <BJ> Aika with her hair down <3
[13:05] <BJ> Did you play Skies, Noss?
[13:07] <Noss> loved skies
[13:07] <Noss> only played DC version though
[13:07] <Scarlet> i never fought evil vyse/aika/fina
[13:07] <BJ> same... so far
[13:07] <BJ> i'll prolly never get around to the gc one
[13:08] <Noss> but plz, Aika can't compare to Millenia...Millenia is a busty redhead who's alter ego is some hyper catholic type.
[13:08] <Noss> it's pretty badass and a strange thought of the saint to the world and whore in the bedroom.
[13:08] <Scarlet> spoilerz
[13:08] <BJ> No wonder this guy I'm playing sucks. He just took a break then came back 7 minutes later and said "are you there?" "had to have sex"
[13:08] <Noss> hah
[13:08] <Scarlet> (she JUST joined me..ive been to 1 dungeon :()
[13:09] <Noss> yea
[13:10] <Noss> HOW OLD IS THAT GAME AGAIN?
[13:10] <Scarlet> 2 months old
[13:10] <Noss> damn you and your ways, scarlet...
[13:11] <Noss> at any rate, the option still holds...should you ever need a 70 grand a year job...I shall vouch for you...
[13:11] <Scarlet> just bookmark that url for when you are bored and gimme a hollar
[13:11] <Noss> (while it would piss me off to have scarlet make more money than me, it would be hilarious to see her just own old angry men in debates)
[13:11] <Scarlet> i dont think theyd let me live there until i got a paycheck
[13:12] <Noss> they?
[13:12] <Scarlet> the casino
[13:12] <Scarlet> i have about $1.25 on me
[13:12] <Noss> the house I'm in has an empty room!
[13:12] <Scarlet> yeah i dont feel like getting killed by a shovel
[13:12] <Noss> you would just have to endure living with most of my family...which..admittedly..would be awful.
[13:12] <Noss> haha
[13:13] <Noss> the shovel only applies to people who show up randomly
[13:13] <Noss> YOU WOULD BE MY PROTOGE
[13:13] <BJ> Uh oh this bastard might win
[13:13] <Noss> the perfect poker dealer...oh yes...scarlet would be such
[13:13] <BJ> 18 in a row on the line...
[13:13] <Noss> don't fuck it up, Bj...
[13:13] <Scarlet> his sexcraft has overpowered you
[13:13] <BJ> He missed that shot by a mile lol
[13:14] <Noss> (I hope "sexcraft" is a word in the new dictionary..if shit like "vlog" and "staycation" is...then "sexcraft" should be there.
[13:14] <BJ> I told him I hoped he had better aim about 10 minutes ago :x
[13:15] <Scarlet> nice bj
[13:15] <BJ> "i am drunk"
[13:15] <BJ> "You were still able to get it up?"
[13:16] <BJ> "all ways"
[13:16] <Noss> scarlet just uttered a phrase that is so magical in only thinking that she just did it...OH YES, I WENT THERE.
[13:16] <Scarlet> yeah fusing gets me hot and bothered
[13:16] <Scarlet> NULL DARK ooooOOoo
[13:16] <Noss> call it whatever you want...it was um..a fusing of skills...but it was still a nice bj
[13:17] <BJ> brb cleanup
[13:17] <Noss> it's not my fault that some people are named blow job
[13:17] <BJ> >:|
[13:17] <BJ> whatever, jimmy
[13:17] <Noss> BJ as a name...Dick as a nickname...it is all silly and fun to me.
[13:17] <Noss> tis a shame people live with that shit.
[13:18] <Noss> randy johnson is the best name ever
[13:18] <BJ> There was a player named Dick Pole
[13:18] <Scarlet> dick butkis
[13:20] <BJ> 20 wins in a row has been my goal for a while... time to choke

[13:50] <BJ33> He's here
[13:50] <Noss> lies...HE DIED
[13:50] <BJ33> Just dunno how much of what I typed earlier went through since I dx'ed
[13:50] <KimiNewt> in your heart
[13:50] <Noss> SOMEONE KILLED HIM DURING POOL!
[13:50] <BJ33> I'll just ask again
[13:51] <BJ33> Do you play viddy games at all anymore, Nosh?
[13:51] <Noss> btw, who the hell is Nosh?
[13:51] <Noss> sounds like a tasty bit of something...
[13:52] <Noss> amd basto...BJ..if you meant Noss...I play singular old ass games that ppl played years ago.
[13:52] <BJ33> like what, recently
[13:52] <Noss> I suck with online games
[13:53] <BJ33> I only play stuff online I'm good at, so basically... Outrun 2, Hot Shots Golf 5, and yahoo pool :P
[13:53] <Noss> most recent...which is probably super old...I'm thoroughly enjoying the Burnout trilogy
[13:53] <Noss> I wish I could do more online stuff, but I'm very very weary of that.
[13:53] <BJ33> Do you like watching yourself crash ;)
[13:53] <Noss> no, I turned off most of that shit
[13:53] <BJ33> weary why?
[13:54] <Noss> I an weary of online things, for I have to get fucking monstrously drunk just to talk to people on irc.
[13:54] <Noss> I'm not exactly sane.
[13:54] <BJ33> oh
[13:54] <BJ33> Do you think we're gonna come getcha
[13:54] <Noss> So, eh, I don't look for online gaming.
[13:54] <BJ33> And take your burnouts
[13:55] <Noss> haha
[13:55] <Noss> naw, it's far more insidious.  It's more looking like a fool to people.
[13:55] <Noss> I can do that no problem when I'm drunk
[13:55] <BJ33> cool. i'm pretty anxious myself. but definitely not online
[13:55] <Noss> When I'm sober, however.  Should I appear foolish or anything else, I will harp on that shit for months and months.
[13:55] <Noss> it aint worth it
[13:56] <Noss> Shit, I harp on many of the dumbass things I've said drunk here, but I can endure it.  Sober...I have no idea how you all do it.
[13:57] <Noss> Voice action...hell, just gaming...amazing that you all can do it.
[13:58] <Noss> And while that does make me a pussy...it only makes me a pussy when I'm sober...my 220 lifting frame when drunk is something that people hesitate to fuck with.
[13:58] <Noss> dunno
[13:58] <Noss> fuck it all
[13:58] <BJ33> I'd rather just type to people in online games unless voice actually makes a difference with teamwork, what have you
[13:59] <Noss> how does that work with xboxlive?  I am asking honestly.
[13:59] <Noss> do people have a keyboard for that type of action?
[13:59] <Noss> or is it more about the voice and such?
[13:59] <BJ33> Just voice
[14:00] <BJ33> PSO for Xbox is the only game I can think of that let you use a keyboard and you needed a special adapter
[14:01] <Noss> ahem...didn't BJ just say, "I'd rather just type to people in online games unless voice actually makes a difference with teamwork"
[14:01] * Y2Kev has joined #GA
[14:01] <Noss> So the online component of xbox is the latter?
[14:02] <BJ33> well i don't play just 360 online
[14:02] <BJ33> Hot Shots Golf 5 on PS3 is keyboard only for most game modes, because it's made by backwards ass Japanese
[14:02] <Noss> To my mind, the greatest thing that the xbox 360 has is online play...xbox live...is fucking awesome
[14:03] <Noss> it kicks the shit out of all the other systems
[14:03] <KimiNewt> Voice does make a difference in many games if it's an action, real-time game
[14:05] <Noss> at any rate, I'm completely insane when it comes to gaming...I'm still freaking out over the possibility of the red ring of death..and I won't buy a god damned ps3 because I'm still waiting for a fucking price drop
[14:05] <Noss> as such...I just try and hit up old ass ps2 games.
[14:05] <BJ33> :)
[14:05] <Noss> so, I play videogames...but I don't have any reference to the games that people are actually playing.
[14:06] <BJ33> I'd probably be content with just a PS2 and DS... and that'd add in PS1 and GBA too
[14:06] * Hitokage has a PC, a PS2, and a DS
[14:06] <BJ33> Who has the Wii you played Nigerian Woods 10 on
[14:07] <Noss> I am thinking I really should buy me some random version of the GB, for I truly love 2d rpgs, castlevanias, metroids, et. al.
[14:07] <Hitokage> well, that too
[14:07] <Noss> and hell, would be fun to find out my brain age is elderly.
[14:07] <Hitokage> but I only play 2-3 games on it that aren't VC
[14:07] <BJ33> 1 VC game a week is maddening
[14:08] <BJ33> most weeks anyway
[14:08] <BJ33> 2 NES games added this year, aww yeah
[14:11] <Tre`> hito doesn't count his Wii anymore?

[00:56] <Tre`> it was more like
[00:56] <EGM92> Tre' if I format windows or something I still have to reinstall those programs even though they're on a different drive

[00:57] <EGM92> got it
[00:57] <EGM92> Don't have that problem.
[00:58] <EGM92> isn't latency times high cause the main drive has to access another drive?
[00:58] <Tre`> no
[00:58] <EGM92> oh was it a samsung drive?
[00:58] <Tre`> the operating system is the one who makes that call and most of that is loaded into ram
[00:58] <Tre`> no
[00:58] <Tre`> WD
[00:58] <EGM92> alright
[00:59] <EGM92> ah
[00:59] <EGM92> WD is good about RMA'ing
[00:59] <Tre`> ya
[00:59] <EGM92> did it just randomly crap out? or is there a known defect? 
[00:59] <Tre`> It either randomly crapped out or overheated
[01:00] <EGM92> ah
[01:00] <EGM92> YES!!!!
[01:00] <EGM92> FEDEX IS HERE

[01:01] <NewAgeRetroHippie> I dunno if HL2 is my fave game yet, gotta play it s'more
[01:01] <EGM92> Are you playing HL2 with high res mods?
[01:02] <Tre`> the worst part of the drive crapping out is that I'm gonna have to redownload a lot of samples

[01:02] <Tre`> my torrent ratio :-/
[01:03] <NewAgeRetroHippie> EGM: Nah, in its base form o.o
[01:03] <NewAgeRetroHippie> Should I stop playing it and play HL first?

[01:03] <NewAgeRetroHippie> Ah
[01:03] <EGM92> HL2 though was pretty awesome
[01:04] <NewAgeRetroHippie> Yeah it is
[01:04] <NewAgeRetroHippie> The plot is awesome, great atmosphere too.
[01:04] <EGM92> I replayed it with highres mods and it was godly
[01:04] <EGM92> it looks good even by todays standards but with HDR and shit enabled its REALLY good
[01:05] <NewAgeRetroHippie> I imagine it'd look so much better with that mod, but yeah, it looks great.
[01:05] <EGM92> you need to play the HL2 tech demo level... something coast....
[01:06] <NewAgeRetroHippie> I downloaded that, yeah
[01:06] <EGM92> I forget the name, I know coast is in the name, that was and still is a show peice

[02:58] <mrsolo> mmo post wow is a bit disappointing
[02:58] <Tre`> mmo including wow is disappointing
[02:58] <mrsolo> warhammer falls short
[02:58] <Tre`> only Eve "gets" it, but Eve combat is so dull
[02:59] <mrsolo> wow was wow 4 years bck meet expectation
[02:59] <Tre`> which is why World of Darkness will be GODLIKE
[02:59] <mrsolo> nowdays..man please just die
[02:59] <mrsolo> dunno
[02:59] <Tre`> CCP gets it, but they can't make werewolves and vampires and mages and shit fight like space ships
[02:59] <Tre`> it's great!
[02:59] <mrsolo> waiting for next big one
[02:59] <Tre`> world of darkness is the next big one
[02:59] <mrsolo> i heard eve is all aobut politics
[02:59] <Tre`> count it
[02:59] <ZombieSupaStar> tre hyping up black prophecy
[02:59] <Tre`> Eve is all about players interacting with other players
[02:59] <Tre`> which is what MMOs should be about
[02:59] <ZombieSupaStar> where WERE U WHEN NEOCRON NEEDED YOU
[03:00] <ZombieSupaStar> !
[03:00] <ZombieSupaStar> ;)
[03:00] <Tre`> I don't think black prophecy will actually be an MMO
[03:00] <Tre`> I think it's gonna be more guild wars-y
[03:00] <Tre`> which is fine
[03:00] <ZombieSupaStar> instanced?
[03:00] <ZombieSupaStar> yeah
[03:00] <Tre`> yeah
[03:00] <ZombieSupaStar> well shit wow is like turning into half mmo half instanced
[03:00] <Tre`> they said they were shooting around alternate pay systems
[03:00] <Tre`> but they'd have to discuss those with their publisher
[03:00] <Tre`> WHICH THEY STILL DON'T HAVE
[03:00] <ZombieSupaStar> with arenas/bgs/raids/dungeons vs the world
[03:00] <mrsolo> wait.. tre: weren't you the one that was ultra hyped about that pirate of carriabean game?
[03:00] <Tre`> pirates of the burning sea?
[03:01] <mrsolo> ya
[03:01] <Tre`> there is a pirates of the caribbean mmo
[03:01] <Tre`> by disney
[03:01] <Tre`> for kids
[03:01] <ZombieSupaStar> does instancing have more server load than noninstanced?
[03:01] <mrsolo> pirate of burning sea
[03:01] <mrsolo> i am glad that i didn't try that one
[03:01] <Tre`> yeah I was
[03:01] <mrsolo> my friend told me.. 'man everybody looks the same'
[03:01] <Tre`> hahaha
[03:01] <Tre`> well, potbs does a lot of things right, but I dunno
[03:01] <Tre`> I am not really into the whole faction battle thing
[03:01] <Tre`> I'm just now realizing this
[03:02] <Tre`> I'd much rather a game be about player made factions
[03:02] <mrsolo> my friend recommended conan
[03:02] <Tre`> rather than predetermined lines in the sand
[03:02] <mrsolo> 'oh ya this is the REAL deal'
[03:02] <mrsolo> look how that turns out
[03:02] <Pimpbaa> ultima online!
[03:02] <Tre`> ultima online got it right, but then they fucked everything up
[03:02] <Tre`> Eve took what we learned from ultima online
[03:02] <Tre`> but made the combat
[03:02] <Tre`> dull*
[03:02] <Tre`> WORLD OF DARKNESS ONLINE
[03:03] <mrsolo> i will wait for a year
[03:03] <mrsolo> that's my rule now
[03:03] <mrsolo> well may be six months
[03:03] <Pimpbaa> wait, world of darkness is white wolf
[03:04] <Pimpbaa> oh man
[03:04] <Tre`> yes

[00:16] * Rotanibor has left #GA
[00:17] <osaka> okay checked onemanga
[00:17] <osaka> bjork-wtf: should i read Worst before Crows
[00:17] <bjork-wtf> crows comes first
[00:17] <bjork-wtf> but there's less of it translated
[00:17] <osaka> so which one is it!
[00:17] <bjork-wtf> worst takes place 2y after the end of crows
[00:18] <Tiduz> It's official. You won't be playing StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty this year, as Blizzard has moved the release date of the real-time strategy game to the "first half of 2010." No, they never dated it; but they have now.
[00:18] <Tiduz> noesssssssssssssssssss
[00:18] <osaka> SO
[00:18] <osaka> OLD
[00:18] <osaka> FUCK.
[00:18] <bjork-wtf> I suppose you could go in either order, but when they reference stuff from Crows in Worst, you won't know who it is
[00:18] <Tiduz> 11:00 PM (17 minutes ago)
[00:18] <Tiduz> Blame slowtaku
[00:18] <bjork-wtf> [13:19] <Tre`> starcraft 2 2010
[00:18] <osaka> so i should read the crows stuff first i guess
[00:18] <bjork-wtf> blame tiduz
[00:19] <osaka> is crows done then? as in published
[00:19] <bjork-wtf> nope
[00:19] <bjork-wtf> er
[00:19] <Tiduz> i was probably downstairs at that time
[00:19] <Tiduz> :p
[00:19] <bjork-wtf> yes,
[00:19] <Tiduz> i dont monitor ga 24/7
[00:19] <Tiduz> >:|"
[00:19] <osaka> lazy translators?
[00:19] <bjork-wtf> but the group doing translations is doing like 1 chapter per week now
[00:19] <osaka> okay
[00:19] <osaka> i'll start with crows then, i'm assuming it's good
[00:19] <bjork-wtf> I think they're up to v9 and there's like 24 of them or something?

[00:35] <warcock_deeznuts> 4 life
[00:35] <EviLore> training bjj and striking for A MONTH
[00:35] <Tre`> neckbeard total though
[00:35] <Tre`> stop looking like a gaffer
[00:35] <EviLore> "I don't know nothing at bjj, I'm just not going to say that I'm good at it yet. Like I said, I'm just focusing on bjj and striking, and no I won't know any advanced moves or a lot of moves, but my goal is to get the basics/essentials down, so I'll be able to hold me own"
[00:35] <warcock_deeznuts> im losing my guido edge :(
[00:36] <Bob_CoffeeAway> You got a Z? definately losing the guido edge there warcock.
[00:36] <EviLore> yeah man, just getting the basics down with one month of training huh.  I HAS A GUARD
[00:36] <Bob_CoffeeAway> just make sure you dont go to the dark side and rice it up.
[00:36] <thesoapster> warcock_deeznuts: lol.
[00:36] <thesoapster> there's an edge?
[00:36] <warcock_deeznuts> bob: i like did a 180 since last year
[00:36] <bjork-wtf> he should turtle for the first round, like ippo
[00:36] <warcock_deeznuts> kind of become an azn hat3r
[00:36] <warcock_deeznuts> well not really
[00:36] <EviLore> pretty ridiculous.  never even done a grappling tournament
[00:37] <warcock_deeznuts> but i despise people who are aznwakkas
[00:37] <EviLore> one month bjj and striking, and some wrestling background
[00:37] * Orin_Lunch slaps warcock_deeznuts around a bit with a large trout
[00:37] <Orin_Lunch> stop hatin
[00:37] <warcock_deeznuts> fuck that
[00:37] <bjork-wtf> I don't even have that much experience, but my offer to fight fedor still stands
[00:37] <warcock_deeznuts> european and european derived cultures>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
[00:37] <Bob_CoffeeAway> godamn pc live update.:(
[00:37] <bjork-wtf> I need $30,153 to get fully out of debt as of today
[00:37] <warcock_deeznuts> the western world + civility
[00:38] <bjork-wtf> so that much, plus my hospital costs post-fight
[00:38] <warcock_deeznuts> =*
[00:38] <Bob_CoffeeAway> bjork-wtf: that is if your alive after a round with fedor.
[00:38] <warcock_deeznuts> fedor is controlled
[00:38] <warcock_deeznuts> he wont kill u if ur a layman
[00:38] <EviLore> I'd pay to see fedor vs bjork
[00:38] <Bob_CoffeeAway> make sure you put gaf as your benifactors if you die.
[00:38] <EviLore> as long as fedor doesn't hold back
[00:38] <warcock_deeznuts> lidell would prolly kill you
[00:38] <warcock_deeznuts> his form is so shitty
[00:38] <bjork-wtf> I wouldn't hold back too
[00:38] <warcock_deeznuts> he cant control his swings
[00:39] <EviLore> bjork, you mean, war?  yeah he's a wild man in the cage
[00:39] <EviLore> swinging for the fences
[00:39] <EviLore> one month bjj and striking.  :boggle.  it's like we're in 1993 or some shit
[00:39] <bjork-wtf> [14:38] <EviLore> as long as fedor doesn't hold back <~ you just don't want to put the forum arcade up
[00:39] <bjork-wtf> it's cool
[00:40] <warcock_deeznuts> maybe he is big like kimbo
[00:40] <warcock_deeznuts> and ghetto
[00:40] <Bob_CoffeeAway> back in 93 the guard was like a secret gameshark code or something.
[00:40] <EviLore> gaffer fighter is 130 pounds
[00:40] <warcock_deeznuts> .
[00:40] <warcock_deeznuts> watched too much ippo
[00:40] <warcock_deeznuts> or some shit
[00:40] <EviLore> which will obviously emphasize technique
[00:40] <warcock_deeznuts> "I WILL DO MYYY BEST!!!!"
[00:41] <EviLore> he says he's working on his COUNTER PUNCHING with one month striking training
[00:41] <EviLore> wtf?
[00:41] <EviLore> more like learning how to jab
[00:41] <warcock_deeznuts> bro
[00:41] <warcock_deeznuts> the jab is an endless endeavor
[00:41] <warcock_deeznuts> perfecting it takes a lifetime
[00:41] <warcock_deeznuts> lawl
[00:41] <warcock_deeznuts> hes a retard
[00:42] <EviLore> counter punching.  
[00:42] * EviLore shakes head
[00:42] <warcock_deeznuts> his best strat 
[00:42] <EviLore> his only hope is that the other guy is terrible
[00:42] <warcock_deeznuts> would be to pretend slipping
[00:42] <EviLore> like, off the street
[00:42] <bjork-wtf> he's probably got friends pumping him up like he's awesome
[00:42] <warcock_deeznuts> and diving for the balls
[00:42] <EviLore> I don't see how his coach/trainer would allow this shit anyway
[00:42] <warcock_deeznuts> OOPS SRRY
[00:43] <pj> what if they put him up against another guy with one month of training
[00:43] <Tre`> ^
[00:43] <Tre`> that's what I'm expecting
[00:43] <bjork-wtf> I'll fight this guy
[00:43] <Tre`> no way they're putting him up against anyone with any half assed amount of training
[00:43] <bjork-wtf> it'll be my warmup before I stretch out Fedor on ppv
[00:43] <pj> he likes to pee on his opponents
[00:44] <Tre`> that'd be like murdering him.
[00:44] <warcock_deeznuts> its kinda of funny
[00:44] <warcock_deeznuts> in a gym jock kind of way
[00:45] <warcock_deeznuts> lawlalwalw u got paned
[00:45] <EviLore> it's still dumb.  you don't fight in an mma match with so little training.  it's absolutely pointless.   like, why would you fight a boxing match with one month training?  you wouldn't have any technique to speak of.  train more, get the fundamentals down, then fight and test yourself.  in MMA the skills required to have a vague idea of what you're doing are way broader, too
[00:45] <Orin_Lunch> dems fighting words
[00:45] <Orin_Lunch> lets do this like men bjork
[00:45] * Orin_Lunch puts on duel disc
[00:45] <Bob_CoffeeAway> Orin:correction, "lets fight like gentelmen!".
[00:45] <bjork-wtf> guys want to just dive in and see if they luck out
[00:45] <Bob_CoffeeAway> do that shit SF3 dudley style!
[00:45] <bjork-wtf> like it's a fast track to going pro and getting endorsements
[00:46] <EviLore> well he kinda sounds like a moron anyway
[00:46] <EviLore> he kept comparing his fight to the UFC.  "IT AIN'T THE UFC GUYS, It'S NOT A BIG DEAL"
[00:46] <bjork-wtf> it's like when they used to have toughman around here
[00:46] <bjork-wtf> guys would go get into it thinking they'd be fighting butterbean or whoever next week
[00:47] <bjork-wtf> and get creamed by some am/pm attendant instead
[00:47] <EviLore> at my gym if was the fucking bjj black belts (or future ones) and dangerous strikers who fought at any level of mma competition.

[03:33] <Orin_Dinner> With a rumored $100 to $200+ million dollar budget, Warhammer Online (WAR) was expected to give World of Warcraft strong competition. Almost a year later, WAR continues to perform well below expectations.
[03:33] <Orin_Dinner> :(
[03:34] <KimiNewt> there there
[03:34] <KimiNewt> perhaps you could cheer yourself up with a sixth meal
[03:34] <Orin_Dinner> DONT TOUCH ME!

[03:38] <Amir0x> What...the...fuck
[03:38] <Sea_Manky> Orin, you need to jump on a winning game bandwagon, like Warhawk
[03:39] <Tiduz> if the servers shut down Orin_Dinner will lose all his h ours of labor

[03:43] <Orin_Dinner> this is why you cant have nice things tiduz
[03:45] <Orin_Dinner> It is hard to understand how EA/Mythic did not see this one coming. The Destruction character models had dramatically superior art, and pretty much all the "cool" looking avatars. Order had terrible looking dwarves, bald Warrior Priests, red-headed-step-child
[03:45] <Orin_Dinner>  Bright Wizards, and some very limp looking High Elves. Destruction had the incredibly impressive looking Chosen, the amazing looking Orcs, and some of the sexiest dark elves on any MMORPG. It should come as no surprise that at release, most servers were heavily dominated in population by Destruction.
[03:46] <Orin_Dinner> Amen
[03:46] <Orin_Dinner> but we turned that around :B
[03:47] <KimiNewt> I'm hungry but it's really later: do I attempt to ignore the hunger and just go to sleep or- not

[04:16] <Sea_Manky> I can't really see it working for anyone but Fox, honestly.
[04:17] <DrForester> im sure msnbc has enough left wing crazies willing to shell out cash
[04:17] <DrForester> and then ABC can host a reality fight show where fox's best nuts face MSNBC's best nuts

[04:18] * poweld has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[04:18] <Sea_Manky> But since Fox is already pushing their circle the wagons mentality on the authoritarian right wing herd, paying for access to the gated community will seem only natural to that crowd

[05:18] <darkh23> lol red sox board
[05:18] <darkh23> "why are the Ray fans cheering like its game 7 of the world series??? Just shows how much jealously they have for boston."
[05:19] <jman2050> which board is that
[05:19] <darkh23> crappy espn one
[05:19] <darkh23> sosh has been boring
[05:19] * Kagari has joined #GA
[05:19] <jman2050> yeah, that doesn't sound like SOSH
[05:20] <jman2050> usually after losses they get all pessimistic and shit
[05:20] <Shinobi_Wilshire> jealous of a team they owned the shit out of last season?
[05:20] <darkh23> lol
[05:20] <BJ> Furcal round trippa
[05:20] <Shinobi_Wilshire> wtf are bosox fans even worrying about 'em anyway?
[05:20] <Shinobi_Wilshire> they're not the ones leading the division
[05:20] <jman2050> they are leading the wild card though
[05:20] <darkh23> lol
[05:20] * Unison has joined #GA
[05:20] <jman2050> It'd be so awesome if they missed the playoffs with the GREATEST PITCHING DEPTH IN HISTORY
[05:20] <darkh23> lol
[05:20] <jman2050> also Yankees win woo
[05:20] <Shinobi_Wilshire> haha
[05:21] <Shinobi_Wilshire> yeah
[05:21] <darkh23> and the worst hitting lineup in history
[05:21] <Shinobi_Wilshire> jays playing the perfect hosts
[05:21] <Shinobi_Wilshire> even halliday lost last night, that's how bad we are
[05:21] <darkh23> yankees/sawx all weekend long
[05:21] <Shinobi_Wilshire> nice
[05:21] <jman2050> because a non-lucky Matsukaka, a rehabbing Brad Penny, a 50-year old John SMoltz, and a young 22-year old with a career 6 ERA in the majors is some amazing depth
[05:21] <Shinobi_Wilshire> lulz
[05:21] <darkh23> lol can't wait to face Smoltz this weekend
[05:22] <darkh23> red sox fans are scared of that one
[05:22] <Shinobi_Wilshire> don't forget the 39 year old first time all star
[05:22] <Shinobi_Wilshire> even the jays would light smoltz up
[05:22] <jman2050> the one that's injured?
[05:22] <Shinobi_Wilshire> haha
[05:22] <Shinobi_Wilshire> well maybe if he pitched left handed
[05:22] <darkh23> sox were 0 for 11 with RISP tonight
[05:23] <Shinobi_Wilshire> I got invited to the game tonight, but I was working late

[06:27] <bluemaxcrunchtime> did schmidt have more than 3 swinging strikes today?
[06:27] <BJ> I was on the toilet for a couple of innings. :x
[06:27] <ZetsubouGuy> Too late blue
[06:27] <ZetsubouGuy> you have been touched
[06:27] <ZetsubouGuy> for the very first time

[06:28] <bluemaxcrunchtime> i dunno
[06:28] <bluemaxcrunchtime> i usually just count them myself 
[06:29] <bluemaxcrunchtime> jason schmidt is so done
[06:30] <BJ> He was bringing it at about 85. Heat
[06:30] <bluemaxcrunchtime> prince fielder stole a base on him
[06:30] <bluemaxcrunchtime> XD
[06:31] <bluemaxcrunchtime> i count 8 swinging strikes
[06:31] <bluemaxcrunchtime> season high!
[06:31] <bluemaxcrunchtime> 2 were by the pitcher
[06:31] <bluemaxcrunchtime> still 6 would be a high for him!
[06:31] <BJ> Prince can sneak one here and there. Just takes so much effort

[08:17] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> Nobody cares about eBay
[08:17] <pj> i know but it doesnt matter
[08:18] <pj> because when you sort in ebay it sorts by item cost + shipping
[08:18] * Bob_Coffee is now known as Bob_CoffeeAway

[08:20] <Kagari> Yeah they are
[08:20] <Kagari> I usually use gaf for selling stuff
[08:21] <Kagari> But people on there aren't really looking for manga and other anime crap that I'm trying to sell

[09:02] <garrettd> fuck starcraft 2
[09:02] <garrettd> where is diablo 3
[09:02] <Kagari> 2011
[09:02] <Kagari> at this rate
[09:02] <Somnia> so starcraft 2 is delayed to bnet 2.0...fuck
[09:02] <Somnia> due to*
[09:02] <nerbo> hardly surprising
[09:02] <Somnia> ya
[09:03] <Somnia> gamings 4th quarter of 2009 has officially been delayed
[09:03] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> Tre eats my taint
[09:03] <garrettd> Are you getting crunked willco?
[09:04] <Kagari> Q1 is going to be too packed
[09:04] <Kagari> so companies will delay into Q2
[09:04] <Somnia> How many BIG games are left in 2009 now (and I mean sales wise not quality wise...) Halo ODST, Modern Warfare, LFD2, NSMBWii and Assassins Creed 2? That is titles that are guranteed to berak a million in a month.
[09:04] <Kagari> GT5, believe
[09:04] <Somnia> haha I don't anymore
[09:05] <Somnia> That will be in Q1
[09:05] <Kagari> maybe in Japan, lolz
[09:05] <Somnia> and force others to delay to Q2
[09:05] <Somnia> which will force others to delay to Q3
[09:05] <Somnia> rinse and repeat
[09:05] <Tre`> lol @ thinking GT5 actually exists
[09:05] <nerbo> nothing this fall worth a shit
[09:05] <nerbo> except Modern Warfare 2
[09:05] <Somnia> Modern Warfare 2 will own this holiday and next (wii next year, lulz)
[09:05] <Kagari> lol
[09:05] <Kagari> gg activision
[09:06] <Tre`> modern warfare 2 is not worth a shit
[09:06] <Tre`> so this fall is essentially worthless
[09:06] <Somnia> but it will outsell everything this year
[09:06] <Tre`> for console games
[09:06] <Tre`> HUAHUAHUA
[09:06] <Tre`> oh wait
[09:06] <Tre`> wait
[09:06] <Tre`> this fall has DJ Hero
[09:06] <Tre`> 2009 saved
[09:06] <Somnia> ...
[09:06] <Kagari> lol
[09:06] <nerbo> another version of Simon
[09:06] <Somnia> DJ Hero Renegade Edition only 199.99
[09:06] <nerbo> weeeee
[09:06] <Tre`> who the fuck is getting renegade edition
[09:07] <Tre`> besides retards
[09:07] <Somnia> well the title doesnt even have 1 reserve yet at my store
[09:07] <Somnia> or in my town
[09:07] <Somnia> same with tony hawk
[09:07] <Tre`> fuck your store
[09:07] <Kagari> lol
[09:07] <Kagari> bomba
[09:07] <nerbo> TOny Hawk = dead franchise
[09:07] <Somnia> rock band beatles bundle has 1 reserve!
[09:07] <Tre`> fuck the beatles
[09:07] <Somnia> game only has quite a few but ya
[09:08] <Kagari> Music games will crash and burn this year
[09:08] <Kagari> I think
[09:08] <Kagari> too over saturated
[09:08] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> Tre hates videogames
[09:08] <Kagari> and bundles getting way too expensive
[09:08] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> Because he sucks at them so bad
[09:08] <Somnia> Guitar Hero 5 isn't getting reserve at all.. and Metallica bombed
[09:08] <Tre`> you wanna go willco
[09:08] <Tre`> huh
[09:08] <Tre`> we can do this right now
[09:08] <Kagari> dont forget Band Hero
[09:08] <Kagari> lol
[09:08] <HadesGigas> Guitar Hero Van Halen will succeed!
[09:08] <nerbo> music games can't burn soon enough
[09:08] <garrettd> nerbo i disagree
[09:09] <garrettd> i think the distinctino should be PERIPHERAL music games
[09:09] <Somnia> people are so fucking confused about band hero, guitar hero,etc.
[09:09] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> You couldn't beat me at any game even if it was called Tre Sucks Cock
[09:09] <Somnia> they are splitting their market and it wont work
[09:09] <Tre`> http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/puzzle/djhero/video/6214667/dj-hero-official-movie-public-enemy-versus-justice?hd=1 -- DJ Hero wins the (american) music game war
[09:09] <HadesGigas> Band Hero is the most confusing name
[09:09] <garrettd> i miss the parappa the rapper, gitaroo man type music game
[09:09] <nerbo> RED RED RED YELLOW RED RED YELOW YELLOW YELLOW GREEN BLUE RED RED RED YELLOW
[09:09] <HadesGigas> I can't wait for the Rock Band guys to make a game called Rock Guitar
[09:09] <nerbo> zzzzzzzzzz
[09:09] <Kagari> lol
[09:09] <Tre`> so you can beat me at sucking cock, willco
[09:09] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> Definitely
[09:09] <Tre`> I'm willing to concede that
[09:09] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> I bet you are
[09:09] <Somnia> Halo ODST has more reserves than any other title besides Modern Warfare 2 which has double it on JUST 360 heh
[09:10] <Tre`> video gamers like shit confirmed
[09:10] <Kagari> The stores by me are doing a midnight launch for batman
[09:10] <Somnia> ya we are too kagari
[09:10] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> I played this game
[09:10] <nerbo> LOL
[09:10] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> It's called Tre Sucks at Games
[09:10] <nerbo> what kind of asshat waits in line at Midnight for Batman?
[09:10] <Somnia> Batman is getting good early reserves
[09:10] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> Its a multi-platinum hit
[09:10] <Kagari> lol
[09:10] <HadesGigas> Band Hero will definitely sell, don't know about the expensive bundles though, but they'are already going after the little girl market pretty hard
[09:11] <Somnia> Band HEro is gonna sell just as good as Hannah Montana PSP...oh wait it isnt
[09:11] <garrettd> what comes out this fall for the pc
[09:11] <HadesGigas> that's on PSP
[09:11] <Kagari> lolz
[09:11] <HadesGigas> nothing can move a psp
[09:11] <Tre`> garrettd:  need for speed shift
[09:11] <Tre`> torchlight
[09:11] <Somnia> Band Hero isnt gonna sell shit, well except for on the Wii maybe
[09:11] <Tre`> borderlands
[09:11] <Somnia> mmm borderlands
[09:11] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> borderlands lol
[09:11] <HadesGigas> money on wii is still money
[09:11] <garrettd> borderlands looks dope
[09:11] <Somnia> whats torchlight tre?
[09:12] <HadesGigas> it's slightly dirtier, but still
[09:12] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> Nerd hyoe
[09:12] <garrettd> yeah i never heard of torchlight
[09:12] <Tre`> torchlight = single player mythos
[09:12] <Somnia> ahh
[09:12] * garrettd is now known as Himuro
[09:12] <Tre`> there's a bunch of shitty mmos coming out later this year
[09:12] <Tre`> champions online, aion
[09:12] <Himuro> i don't care bout any of those honestly
[09:12] <Kagari> Lots of MMOs next year too
[09:12] <Tre`> you shouldn't
[09:12] <Himuro> i guess right now i can catch up on a bunch of old stuff
[09:12] <nerbo> the MMO genre should just be renamed WoW
[09:13] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> MMOs are for socially awkward loons
[09:13] <Himuro> i've been playing a bunch of demos on my computer
[09:13] <bluemaxcrunchtime> shitty mmos
[09:13] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> Even WoW
[09:13] <bluemaxcrunchtime> redundant!
[09:13] <Tre`> oh
[09:13] <Tre`> natural selection 2
[09:13] <Himuro> like company of heroes, titan quest
[09:13] <Tre`> willco:  weren't you playing WoW
[09:13] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> Nope.
[09:13] <Himuro> lol
[09:13] <Tre`> natural selection 2 comes out this year
[09:13] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> I do more important things with my time.
[09:13] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> Like bang chicks.
[09:13] <Tre`> like beat me at sucking dick
[09:14] <Himuro> sucks i missed last weekends steam sale
[09:14] <Somnia> L4D2 is this year also...but you arent allowed to buy it as a pc gamer apparently heh
[09:14] <Himuro> they were selling coh for like 5 bucks?
[09:14] <Tre`> yeah, this fall is kinda shitty
[09:14] <Tre`> on all platforms
[09:14] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> Modern Warfare 2 :rock
[09:14] <Himuro> there's uhhhh brutal legend
[09:14] <Willco_Gets_Crunked> Halo 3 :rock
[09:14] <Himuro> uhhh
[09:14] <Tre`> I think all I'm getting is tekken 6, DJ hero, torchlight, and borderlands.  I think
[09:14] <Tre`> oh and Naumachia
[09:14] <Tre`> if it makes it out
[09:14] <bluemaxcrunchtime> halo 3 snore
[09:15] <Himuro> i want brutal legend, way of the samurai 3, mass effect 2, borderlands, and uncharted 2
[09:15] <bluemaxcrunchtime> $60 for a 5 hour game and multi player youve already played to death
[09:15] <Himuro> maybe DJ hero
[09:15] <Somnia> mass effect = next year
[09:15] <Himuro> depends on reviews
[09:15] <Tre`> oh and Shootmania
[09:15] <Himuro> really i thought it was christmas 09
[09:15] <HadesGigas> Bayonetta
[09:15] <Tre`> under the radar titles ftw
[09:15] <Somnia> no himu =/
[09:15] <Himuro> ...really
[09:15] <Himuro> that sucks
[09:15] <Tre`> bayonetta is like the most embarrassing game ever
[09:15] <Tre`> confirming all the stereotypes
[09:16] <Himuro> but it has a chick using her middle finger to turn on a motorbike
[09:16] <HadesGigas> Pretty much!
[09:16] <bluemaxcrunchtime> i saw the bayonetta chick at e3
[09:16] <bluemaxcrunchtime> outside of costume
[09:16] <bluemaxcrunchtime> damn she was tall
[09:16] <bluemaxcrunchtime> and kind of cute
[09:16] <Himuro> she looks like she has a dick
[09:16] <Tre`> she can
[09:16] <Tre`> if she wants to
[09:16] <Tre`> :D~~
[09:16] <HadesGigas> Though i think that FFXIII shiva 69 bike is probably more embarrassing than anything from bayonetta so far
[09:16] <Tre`> I dunno the shiva 69 bike
[09:17] <Tre`> because I've completely ignored FFXIII
[09:17] <Tre`> with its 1999 ground textures
[09:17] <Himuro> that bike looks so bad
[09:17] <Himuro> like
[09:17] <HadesGigas> shiva turns into a bike when you summon her
[09:17] <Himuro> you got two shiva's on a bike
[09:17] <HadesGigas> a bike made of ladies 
[09:17] <Tre`> oh japan
[09:17] <Himuro> and one of the faces is staring at dude's crotch
[09:17] <Himuro> it's just staring at it
[09:17] <Himuro> so awkward
[09:18] <HadesGigas> http://girlsofwar.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/ff13-shiva-bike.jpg
[09:18] <Himuro> she is like "i want you"
[09:19] <Himuro> and the other shiva has her nose in his ass
[09:19] <Somnia> ya the Shiva bike freaks me out heh
[09:19] <HadesGigas> the one behind him looks like she doesn't want to touch his ass
[09:19] <Tre`> lollllllll
[09:19] <HadesGigas> her arms all pulled back
[09:19] <Tre`> hahaha
[09:19] <Tre`> this is why japan is no longer relevant to video games
[09:19] <Himuro> i'd really like to meet who came up with that idea
[09:19] <Bob_CoffeeAway> thats the seatbelt, the shiva grabs dat ass
[09:20] <bluemaxcrunchtime> the problem with japanese games
[09:20] <bluemaxcrunchtime> is that they have too many planners/designers
[09:20] <bluemaxcrunchtime> coming up with shit
[09:20] <HadesGigas> http://facanoconsole.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/final_fantasy_xiii_96.jpg
[09:20] <bluemaxcrunchtime> to justify their jobs
[09:20] <HadesGigas> they planned that out a lot
[09:20] <bluemaxcrunchtime> that just make the games worse
[09:21] <Himuro> i just love that design tho man
[09:21] <Himuro> she's got a wheel for hair
[09:21] <Bob_CoffeeAway> the problem is belt buckles and zippas
[09:21] <Himuro> and probably an exhaust pipe for a dick
[09:21] <Tre`> hahaha
[09:21] <Tre`> god damn
[09:21] <Tre`> that dude even has 3 belt buckles on his BOOTS
[09:21] <Tre`> and not even belt buckles on the front
[09:21] <Tre`> like those old 1700s shoes
[09:21] <Himuro> hahaha
[09:22] <Himuro> don't have the time to tie them shoes
[09:22] <Tre`> the belt buckles are on the back of the shoe
[09:22] <Bob_CoffeeAway> dont give nomura ideas
[09:22] <Bob_CoffeeAway> he's gonna take that shit back to piligrim days!
[09:22] <Tre`> when is he going to give someone belt buckle chest hair
[09:22] <Himuro> a pilgrim hat with a zipper would be awesome
[09:22] <Tre`> like lulu's belt buckle dress
[09:22] <Rotanibor> i forgot shiva turns into a bike. thats pretty awful
[09:22] <Tre`> a chick topless except for a scarf made of belt buckles
[09:23] <bluemaxcrunchtime> i hope they change shiva bike
[09:23] <HadesGigas> http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j148/Xngears/Blog/2psn18y.jpg at least the one in back is blindfolded
[09:23] <bluemaxcrunchtime> but i guess at this point it is too late
[09:23] <HadesGigas> doesn't have to look at ass all day
[09:23] <Tre`> oh god
[09:23] <Tre`> that's not 69
[09:23] <Tre`> shiva is scissoring itself
[09:23] <HadesGigas> scissors
[09:23] <HadesGigas> yeah
[09:23] <Bob_CoffeeAway> is that an aereth i see in the backround?
[09:23] <HadesGigas> yeah thats a toy version
[09:23] <Tre`> definitely bob
[09:23] <Rotanibor> yeah thats aeris in the background
[09:23] <Tre`> scissoring shiva
[09:23] <Himuro> are those toys or something
[09:23] <Tre`> god damn japan
[09:23] <HadesGigas> they are already making shiva sex bike toys
[09:23] <Tre`> GOD DAMN
[09:23] <Kagari> rofl
[09:24] <Himuro> i still don't understand it
[09:24] <Himuro> why would they make shiva turn into a bike
[09:24] <Himuro> in some sort of sexual fetish position no less
[09:24] <HadesGigas> they are making all the summons transformers
[09:24] <Himuro> i know about that
[09:24] <Rotanibor> the nomura designs lately that piss me off are those Kingdom Hearts ones where everybody is wearing a solid black robe with a giant fucking zipper going down it
[09:24] <Bob_CoffeeAway> i think michael bay got ahold of square.
[09:24] <HadesGigas> well that's why... they just saw the transformers movie
[09:24] <bluemaxcrunchtime> you know what is awesome
[09:24] <bluemaxcrunchtime> about shiva bike
[09:25] <Bob_CoffeeAway> Michael bay and tetsuya normura present FF13 EXPLOSIONS!
[09:25] <bluemaxcrunchtime> its that they think that one is the best one to show us
[09:25] <Tre`> hahaha
[09:25] <bluemaxcrunchtime> just think about all the ones we havent seen yet
[09:25] <Tre`> it's all downhill from here
[09:25] <bluemaxcrunchtime> seriously
[09:25] <bluemaxcrunchtime> they went through their summon designs
[09:25] <bluemaxcrunchtime> and said
[09:25] <HadesGigas> they mentioned some other one didn't they?
[09:25] <Himuro> carbuncle has a seat on him
[09:25] <Himuro> so whoever summons carbuncle will ride him
[09:25] <bluemaxcrunchtime> "guys which one of these best represents our design philosophy? which one will wow them"

[11:46] <ZombieSupaStar> this is a fps rpg but not like fallout 3
[11:46] <warcock_deeznuts> diablo is an rpg?
[11:46] <ddkawaii> ok

[11:46] <ddkawaii> is the emphasis more on shooting?
[11:46] <ZombieSupaStar> yeah
[11:46] <ddkawaii> or exploration?
[11:46] <ddkawaii> oh i wonder if i'll like it
[11:46] <ZombieSupaStar> shooting isnt based on dice rolls
[11:47] * Rotanibor has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[11:47] <ddkawaii> i'm not really a shooter guy
[11:47] <ddkawaii> oh so it's skill based shooting
[11:47] <ZombieSupaStar> its basically like diablo 2, as a fps
[11:47] <ddkawaii> all right

[11:49] <ddkawaii> hehe
[11:49] <mrsolo> 1 billion dollars. man that is a lot
[11:49] <warcock_deeznuts> u can count
[11:49] <ZombieSupaStar> "It’s like Fallout 3. No, wait, it’s like Hellgate. No, wait, it’s like Doom. 
[11:49] <ZombieSupaStar> Well… it has some of the core values of all of those, but a very different implementation. It’s an RPG-FPS, fundamentally. But unlike Fallout 3 and Mass Effect and Hellgate, this isn’t an FPS-like targeting reticule built awkwardly on top of dice-rolls and statistics. It’s statistics and dice-rolls built on top of a first-person shooter. That simple inversion is key to why Borderlands works – this is an action game first and foremost. You wo
[11:49] <ZombieSupaStar> "
[11:49] <warcock_deeznuts> solo you act like its unheard of
[11:50] <mrsolo> i guess lots of people still subscribe wow
[11:50] <warcock_deeznuts> its huge for a videogame company though yeah
[11:50] <warcock_deeznuts> or entertainment in genral
[11:50] <mrsolo> for videogame company
[11:50] <warcock_deeznuts> what amazes me
[11:50] <mrsolo> no..for a game title
[11:50] <mrsolo> it is huge
[11:50] <ddkawaii> oh
[11:50] <ddkawaii> it's gearbox
[11:50] <warcock_deeznuts> im curious to know the profit margins on WoW
[11:50] <ZombieSupaStar> yeah
[11:50] <warcock_deeznuts> i still think its enormous
[11:50] <ZombieSupaStar> trepidation ddk
[11:50] <ddkawaii> haven't gearbox's last few effors been sorta bad?
[11:50] <ZombieSupaStar> lol
[11:50] <warcock_deeznuts> convincing people that they need a videogame
[11:50] <ddkawaii> yeah
[11:50] <warcock_deeznuts> and pay for it like a service
[11:50] <ZombieSupaStar> i prefer to remember their better hal life 1 days
[11:50] <warcock_deeznuts> is ridiculous
[11:50] <ddkawaii> gearbox sorta scares me
[11:51] <warcock_deeznuts> gearbox fucked CS up
[11:51] <mrsolo> warock: well it passes main r&d..so basically just oeprating cost
[11:51] <warcock_deeznuts> Actually valve fucked CS up
[11:51] <warcock_deeznuts> so yeah
[11:51] <mrsolo> warcock: and few to add contents..so ya profit margin is pretty high right now
[11:51] <warcock_deeznuts> solo: thats what im saying
[11:51] <warcock_deeznuts> but op cost has to be reasonable
[11:51] <warcock_deeznuts> these fucks have to be making shitloads of profits
[11:51] <warcock_deeznuts> again
[11:51] <ddkawaii> wait
[11:51] <mrsolo> but my guess is bulk of those revenue is piped to next title right now
[11:51] <ddkawaii> why does gearbox's president say
[11:51] <ddkawaii> diablo
[11:51] <ddkawaii> "die-ablow"
[11:51] <ddkawaii> haha
[11:51] <ddkawaii> he says diablo funny
[11:51] <ddkawaii> lol
[11:52] <warcock_deeznuts> how the fuck do you manage to convince 10 million people to pay for a service monthly as if it was an important product for their routinely life
[11:52] <warcock_deeznuts> is wow
[11:52] <Tre`> it's 15$
[11:52] <warcock_deeznuts> kids are dumb i ghess
[11:52] <Tre`> it's not that much cash
[11:52] <warcock_deeznuts> yes it is tard
[11:52] <mrsolo> warcocK; all about marketing
[11:52] <warcock_deeznuts> 15 is like a phone line
[11:52] <warcock_deeznuts> no its not marketing
[11:52] <ddkawaii> tre - my pc game i had you test a test hardness for is almost done!
[11:52] <warcock_deeznuts> its the product itself
[11:52] <Tre`> most people have cellphone plans these days
[11:52] <mrsolo> warcock: you do expansion release every 12 months
[11:52] <Tre`> nice ddk
[11:52] <Tre`> cellphone plans worth like
[11:52] <Tre`> 70-80$
[11:52] <Tre`> again
[11:52] <Tre`> 15$ is not much
[11:52] <mrsolo> warcock: people will subsribe 3-12 months.. play for 2 :-)
[11:52] <mrsolo> warcock: cha ching
[11:52] <warcock_deeznuts> it is alot for something that is useless
[11:53] <warcock_deeznuts> cable is 20
[11:53] <Tre`> 15$ is like, 2 trips to a fast food joint
[11:53] <warcock_deeznuts> basic
[11:53] <warcock_deeznuts> eat my shit
[11:53] <Tre`> or some candy bars
[11:53] <Tre`> basic cable is fucking terrible
[11:53] <ZombieSupaStar> does anyone have and dota clone invites?
[11:53] <ZombieSupaStar> :[
[11:53] <warcock_deeznuts> eitherway i win
[11:53] <Tre`> which clone, zombie

[11:53] <ZombieSupaStar> ill be your internet friends
[11:53] <mrsolo> but ya 15 bucks a month isn't much
[11:53] <warcock_deeznuts> it is alot
[11:53] <warcock_deeznuts> for what it is
[11:53] <warcock_deeznuts> homos
[11:53] <warcock_deeznuts> its nothing
[11:54] <ddkawaii> game developers are hilarious though
[11:54] <warcock_deeznuts> its labor
[11:54] <warcock_deeznuts> for no purpose
[11:54] <warcock_deeznuts> and you get mad when you get ganked
[11:54] <mrsolo> it is a lot but it is sorta fall into cheap disposable income side
[11:54] <ddkawaii> games cost so much because people cram too much shit into games
[11:54] <warcock_deeznuts> negative vibes
[11:54] <ZombieSupaStar> warcock would like dwarf fortress
[11:54] <Tre`> <warcock_deeznuts> and you get mad when you get ganked -- stop playing on PVP servers
[11:54] <Tre`> PVP servers in WoW are stupid
[11:54] <Tre`> meaningless
[11:54] <mrsolo> ya
[11:54] <warcock_deeznuts> i love to rape lvl 15s
[11:55] <warcock_deeznuts> it makes my life worthwile to ruin a 10 year old's day
[11:55] <mrsolo> anybody still play in wow pvp server now?
[11:55] <warcock_deeznuts> u kidding?
[11:55] <mrsolo> i am curious if it is still free for all
[11:55] <warcock_deeznuts> most people play pvp
[11:55] <Tre`> probably, but nobody cares
[11:55] <Tre`> because everyone who cares about PVP just plays arena
[11:55] <Tre`> ZZZZZZZz
[11:55] <ddkawaii> hey tre - are steam and impulse sales #s out
[11:55] <warcock_deeznuts> stfu arena is fun
[11:55] <ddkawaii> or do they continue to refuse to release them?
[11:55] <Tre`> they release charts but no numbers
[11:55] <Tre`> steam does
[11:55] <Tre`> impulse doesn't
[11:56] <ddkawaii> i see
[11:56] <warcock_deeznuts> cs numbars
[11:56] <ddkawaii> i hate  when people other than valve talk up the stories in their shooters

[12:05] <mrsolo> hmm didn't know zappos was doing billion dollar a year
[12:05] <warcock_deeznuts> the specialists was so much fun

[12:06] <EviLore> the specialists rocks.  wish they made a source version
[12:07] <EviLore> man, this gaffer mma guy is getting a lot of truth bombs dropped on him. 
[12:07] <ddkawaii> ?
[12:08] <EviLore> gaffer has trained mma for one month and is fighting next month
[12:08] <ddkawaii> oh snap
[12:08] <ddkawaii> link?
[12:08] <EviLore> only has a wrestling background
[12:08] <ddkawaii> uh-oh
[12:08] <EviLore> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=370321
[12:08] <ddkawaii> could end very bad for him
[12:08] <EviLore> yes
[12:09] <ddkawaii> lol@ him trying to think up a nickname instead of worrying about his first fight
[12:09] <ddkawaii> and only a wrestling background
[12:09] <ddkawaii> haha
[12:09] <EviLore> yes
[12:09] <EviLore> he says he's training COUNTER PUNCHING
[12:10] <ddkawaii> :-(
[12:10] <EviLore> one month into his very first striking training
[12:10] <ddkawaii> ...
[12:10] <warcock_deeznuts> he should train dempsey roll moar
[12:10] <EviLore> and his bjj "isn't the best," but he knows the basics!
[12:10] <ddkawaii> ...
[12:10] <ddkawaii> how can someone about to fight
[12:11] <ddkawaii> not really understand what u need to to to have a safe mma fight
[12:11] <EviLore> one month bjj is extreme noob white belt who will not be able to sub ANYONE at the gym
[12:11] <ddkawaii> yup
[12:11] <EviLore> and if you can't sub anyone at the gym, how are you going to do it in an mma fight
[12:11] <ddkawaii> when i was training bjj
[12:11] <ddkawaii> i was getting owned by everyone
[12:11] <ddkawaii> including guys 40 lbs lighter than me
[12:11] <ddkawaii> hehe
[12:11] <EviLore> yeah, that's just how it goes.  white --> blue is learning how to survive
[12:12] <ddkawaii> yup
[12:12] <warcock_deeznuts> accidental cup shots
[12:12] <warcock_deeznuts> phase opponent
[12:12] <ddkawaii> there are times when i was totall confused
[12:12] <warcock_deeznuts> go for the kill
[12:12] <warcock_deeznuts> win
[12:12] <ddkawaii> and nothing at all i could do
[12:12] <ddkawaii> if he thinks 1 month is enough
[12:12] <ddkawaii> to stop from getting seriously hurt
[12:12] <ddkawaii> he's mistaken
[12:12] <EviLore> yep
[12:12] <ddkawaii> i'm actually sorta worried for him
[12:12] <warcock_deeznuts> why
[12:12] <warcock_deeznuts> hes been told
[12:12] <warcock_deeznuts> and he he does it
[12:12] <ddkawaii> i would post in that thread
[12:13] <warcock_deeznuts> its his own them fault
[12:13] <ddkawaii> but i guess he doesnt need me piling on
[12:13] <ddkawaii> heh
[12:13] <warcock_deeznuts> them = damn
[12:13] <ddkawaii> ive minimally trained
[12:13] <ddkawaii> and if i were to start fighting
[12:14] <ddkawaii> i'd shedule my first
[12:14] <ddkawaii> like a year from now
[12:14] <ddkawaii> 'cause i know i'm not ready 
[12:14] <ddkawaii> lol@ 1 month training
[12:14] <EviLore> one year minimum really, for the lowest level possible fight, training seriously and starting out in athletic shape
[12:14] <ddkawaii> yeah
[12:15] <EviLore> it takes a couple years of serious training to get competent at striking
[12:15] <ddkawaii> well i've been doing boxing for a 1.5 years now
[12:15] <ddkawaii> and i'm not even confident in my striking
[12:15] <kassatsu> that guy is gunna get rocked
[12:15] <ddkawaii> and to be honest
[12:15] <kassatsu> i hope someone records it
[12:15] <ddkawaii> i'm not really confident in my ability to be struk
[12:15] <ddkawaii> heh
[12:15] <warcock_deeznuts> i hate it
[12:15] <warcock_deeznuts> everytime i jab
[12:15] <warcock_deeznuts> i worry about form
[12:16] <warcock_deeznuts> and it fucks me up
[12:16] <ddkawaii> also 
[12:16] <warcock_deeznuts> my trainer says i do better when im not thinking about it
[12:16] <ddkawaii> boxing and mma skills, except for being in atheletic shape
[12:16] <warcock_deeznuts> i.e being more aggresive
[12:16] <ddkawaii> dont really transfer over well
[12:16] <warcock_deeznuts> solid striking can help
[12:16] <warcock_deeznuts> its certainly not detrimental
[12:16] <ddkawaii> the amount of force one can generate with boxing or mma gloves is actualy almost the same. but the dfiference in size requires different techniques
[12:16] <ddkawaii> especially with extra defense in boxing
[12:16] <warcock_deeznuts> if you understand its limitations
[12:16] <warcock_deeznuts> in mma
[12:17] <ddkawaii> countering is uhh
[12:17] <ddkawaii> only for advanced people
[12:17] <ddkawaii> he's a tard if he thinks he's gonna step in and do taht
[12:17] <warcock_deeznuts> it takes years of experience
[12:17] <warcock_deeznuts> and muscle memory
[12:17] <warcock_deeznuts> to counter
[12:17] <warcock_deeznuts> lols
[12:17] <warcock_deeznuts> just having the balls the gamble
[12:17] <warcock_deeznuts> LOLS
[12:17] <EviLore> that he says he's training countering is just so silly
[12:18] <warcock_deeznuts> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=370328
[12:18] <warcock_deeznuts> america fuck yeah
[12:19] <ddkawaii> btw
[12:19] <ddkawaii> lol@ using a nickname u made up yourself
[12:19] <ddkawaii> haha
[12:19] <ddkawaii> what's the point in that?
[12:19] <warcock_deeznuts> well it kinda fits with his the planning behind his match
[12:19] <warcock_deeznuts> too into it
[12:19] <ddkawaii> to be honest
[12:19] <warcock_deeznuts> for the props
[12:19] <ddkawaii> at 135
[12:19] <ddkawaii> he should forget striking
[12:19] <ddkawaii> haha
[12:19] <ddkawaii> and just ball it up with bjj
[12:20] <warcock_deeznuts> i dont get it
[12:20] <ddkawaii> 1 month isnt gonna do much for anything he's trianing up though
[12:20] <ddkawaii> haha
[12:20] <warcock_deeznuts> eh i can see your point if your talking about knockout power not being helpful at lower weights and it being way more technical
[12:20] <EviLore> well he says he's in bumfuck south dakota and there are no bjj places within 100 miles
[12:20] <warcock_deeznuts> but mexican boxers counter this notion lolz
[12:21] <warcock_deeznuts> hes fighthing a stack of hay
[12:21] <warcock_deeznuts> with a belt
[12:21] <ddkawaii> all i know is
[12:21] <ddkawaii> getting on the ground w/o experience
[12:21] <ddkawaii> isfucked
[12:21] <warcock_deeznuts> he will learn his lesson
[12:21] <EviLore> well he's doing bjj at an MMA gym.  just crosstraining and such
[12:21] <ddkawaii> i weigh  175 lbs
[12:21] <ddkawaii> and was getting owned by guys this dude's size
[12:21] <ddkawaii> hehe
[12:21] <warcock_deeznuts> hes not the first retard that gets in the ring unprepared
[12:22] <ddkawaii> well i hope he does well
[12:22] <ddkawaii> and gets out of the fight with all his parts intact
[12:22] <warcock_deeznuts> lawl he might win
[12:22] <ddkawaii> hop he ups a video
[12:22] <warcock_deeznuts> it all depends on the level of competition
[12:22] <EviLore> me on the ground vs a purple, man, they could annihilate me any way they want.  call out a submission ahead of time and then get there and sink it in, roger gracie style
[12:22] * Kawasaki has joined #GA
[12:23] <ddkawaii> yup
[12:23] <EviLore> I coudl avoid submissions against blues, but they'd still usually end up with positional advantage
[12:23] <EviLore> w/ 6 months training
[12:23] <ddkawaii> he said "im not the best at bjj"
[12:23] <EviLore> and in mma, positional advantage = getting punched in the face 100 times 
[12:23] <ddkawaii> but after 1 monthe
[12:23] <ddkawaii> it should be
[12:23] <ddkawaii> "i know nothing about bjj"
[12:24] <EviLore> yep
[12:24] <ddkawaii> and yes, even getting in the right position
[12:24] <ddkawaii> to possibly get a position advantage
[12:24] <ddkawaii> is hard
[12:24] <ddkawaii> at the early levels
[12:24] <ddkawaii> well i wish him the best
[12:24] <ddkawaii> i never like to see anyone get hurt
[12:24] <EviLore> I just want to see a video fo the fight
[12:25] <warcock_deeznuts> i dont get it
[12:25] <ddkawaii> me too
[12:25] <warcock_deeznuts> the gunman
[12:25] <warcock_deeznuts> is decent lookin
[12:25] <warcock_deeznuts> why the h888888
[12:25] <warcock_deeznuts> for womenz
[12:25] <ddkawaii> evil - u should try boxing
[12:26] <ddkawaii> evil - it's totally differet
[12:26] <ddkawaii> but super fun
[12:26] <EviLore> ddk: I'm gonna be doing muay thai
[12:26] <ddkawaii> ahh nice
[12:26] <ddkawaii> i tried it for like 1 month
[12:26] <ddkawaii> but it's too expensiv ehere
[12:26] <ddkawaii> :-(
[12:26] <EviLore> ah
[12:26] * Kawasaki has quit IRC (Quit: )
[12:26] <ddkawaii> oddly enough bjj is the cheapest
[12:26] <ddkawaii> but all the good places are FAR from tokyo
[12:26] <ddkawaii> :-(
[12:27] <EviLore> yeah I'm working on my conditioning a ton right now, that was always really awful for me and was holding me back last I trained.  after I start to get confident in it I'm going bjj, and once my body's accustomed to bjj again I'm going for muay thai, most likely. 
[12:27] <ddkawaii> heh
[12:28] <ddkawaii> i tyy to run 16km day
[12:28] <ddkawaii> altho recently i'm down to like 10
[12:28] <ddkawaii> :-(
[12:28] <ddkawaii> i'm just too tired
[12:28] <ddkawaii> im thinking about cutting back on weights
[12:28] <EviLore> I'm still way out of shape, but if my cardio gets better then training bjj/mt will take me the rest of the way I want to go.  
[12:28] <ddkawaii> it's really draining, especially in the heat of this summer
[12:28] <ddkawaii> :-(
[12:28] * Orbi has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[12:29] <warcock_deeznuts> 16 km is good
[12:29] <ddkawaii> i'm pretty terrible @ bjj to be honest
[12:29] <warcock_deeznuts> 10 milez.
[12:29] <warcock_deeznuts> lolz
[12:29] <ddkawaii> so many variables to track
[12:29] <ddkawaii> and going against your natural instincts
[12:30] <ddkawaii> @ times is hard
[12:30] <warcock_deeznuts> huh
[12:31] <EviLore> always takes a lot of time to change that, yah.  in anything
[12:31] <ddkawaii> yup
[12:32] <ddkawaii> It takes months of daily repetition to build DECENT (not good, but OKAY) striking technique. Slow-as-fuck pad work in order to understand your range of motion, your reach and distance, and your arsenal of striking weapons. MONTHS. A good striking instructor would never let you do even so much as light sparring until you've learned correct technique and good striking habits.
[12:32] <ddkawaii> heheh
[12:32] <ddkawaii> truth
[12:34] <EviLore> yep
[12:34] <EviLore> so I'm wondering what moron coach would sign him up for this shit
[12:35] <EviLore> or if he did it himself
[12:35] <ddkawaii> prolly did it himself
[12:35] <ddkawaii> i'm sure a coach wouldnt
[12:35] <ddkawaii> no matter how shitty
[12:37] <warcock_deeznuts> thats how they build a 10-0 record
[12:37] <warcock_deeznuts> to get some eye from ufc
[12:37] <warcock_deeznuts> lololol
[12:38] * Orbi has joined #GA
[12:39] <EviLore> yeah, fight gaffer cans 30 or 40 times
[12:39] <ddkawaii> u can get the same record as fedor
[12:39] <ddkawaii> just fight gaf cans
[12:39] <ddkawaii> 30-0
[12:39] <ddkawaii> and then sign a 5 mil fight with fedor
[12:43] <ddkawaii> btw
[12:43] <EviLore> well I just asked the dude
[12:43] <ddkawaii> there's a sambo school in shibuya
[12:43] <ddkawaii> how weird is tathat?
[12:43] <EviLore> whether his instructor signed off on it
[12:43] <ddkawaii> it'll be interesting to hear his reply
[12:44] <EviLore> sambo has some international presence, pretty sure there are some places in america too
[12:44] <EviLore> for a long time now
[12:44] <ddkawaii> i love how he was initially worried abou tall the unimportant parts
[12:44] <ddkawaii> like nickname
[12:44] <EviLore> yeah
[12:44] <ddkawaii> next he'll ask about intro music
[12:44] <ddkawaii> :-P
[12:44] <EviLore> every mma fan should have their intro music decided already!
[12:45] <ddkawaii> haha
[12:46] <warcock_deeznuts> his instructor needs to watch redbelt
[12:46] <warcock_deeznuts> lolz
[12:46] <EviLore> redbelt <3
[12:46] <EviLore> mamet <3
[12:48] <warcock_deeznuts> i was watching some documentary on milt channel
[12:48] <warcock_deeznuts> and they raped the spartan theme
[12:48] <warcock_deeznuts> tre
[12:48] <warcock_deeznuts> neotokyo is bad
[12:48] <EviLore> lack of sights = zzzzz
[12:49] <warcock_deeznuts> dunno the game dosent feel right
[12:49] <warcock_deeznuts> reg is stupid
[12:49] <EviLore> too many weapons
[12:49] <warcock_deeznuts> locked range weapons = lolz
[12:49] <warcock_deeznuts> cant do anything in long corridors but die
[12:51] <warcock_deeznuts> .

[13:04] <EviLore> dunno, I killed people just fine.  
[13:04] <EviLore> I just didn't think much of the game
[13:06] <warcock_deeznuts> DUNNO
[13:06] <warcock_deeznuts> maybe the initial smgs blow total long range

[14:30] <duckroll> i havent read the latest one yet
[14:30] <duckroll> i read up to 3 i think
[14:30] <duckroll> 3 was like 5 pages long
[14:30] <duckroll> Hirano is super lazy :P
[14:30] <Dascu> indeed he is
[14:30] <Dascu> fun reference to Hannibal and Scipio in the recent chapter
[14:31] <duckroll> heh
[14:31] <duckroll> i doubt the story will get started anytime soon
[14:31] <duckroll> certainly not within this year
[14:31] <duckroll> at least the first volume will be entirely about forming the team
[14:32] <duckroll> did you watch Hellsing VI yet?
[14:32] <Dascu> no no, still waiting for subs! 
[14:32] <duckroll> lulz
[14:33] <duckroll> might as well wait for the US release then :P
[14:33] <duckroll> i don't think anyone decent is interested in subbing it
[14:33] <duckroll> there isnt even a decent raw
[14:33] <duckroll> im glad i bought the blu-ray
[14:33] <duckroll> :P
[14:33] <Dascu> they're all to busy subbing the latest moe anime
[14:34] <Dascu> still waiting for my Golgo13 subs!
[14:34] <duckroll> that's not really it
[14:34] <duckroll> i think interest for Hellsing is dead
[14:34] <duckroll> :(
[14:34] <duckroll> im very sad
[14:34] <duckroll> hope it doesnt get canned after VII

[14:35] <duckroll> because i have bought the LE of all the volumes so far!
[14:35] <duckroll> 1-5 on DVD, 6 on blu-ray!
[14:35] <duckroll> i'll get the 1-5 blu-ray box too!

[14:36] <duckroll> no
[14:36] <Dascu> I can't remember how it ended
[14:36] <Dascu> gah
[14:36] <duckroll> Hirano doesnt give a shit
[14:36] <Dascu> stupid Hirano
[14:36] <duckroll> neither should you
[14:36] <duckroll> Dawn is pretty bad :P
[14:36] <Dascu> I want to know who "She" is!
[14:37] <Dascu> "It's Shining Force Gear for the Wii." <- speculation, or do you know something?
[14:39] <duckroll> She was revealed at the end of Hellsing
[14:39] <duckroll> it was boring
[14:39] <duckroll> :P
[14:39] <duckroll> throwaway reference
[14:39] <duckroll> Hirano has no intention of finishing The Dawn i think

[16:57] <Shinobi_Wilshire> LOL
[16:57] <Shinobi_Wilshire> what a dumb fuck
[16:57] <Shinobi_Wilshire> I don't get the whole tatoos thing
[16:58] <darkh23> how bout some of those people who get shit like Yoshi tatooed on their back
[16:58] <Shinobi_Wilshire> maybe it's cause I'm a brother
[16:58] <Shinobi_Wilshire> and they'd barely show anyway
[16:58] <Shinobi_Wilshire> lol dark
[16:58] <Tre`> yeah tattoos suck on black folk
[16:58] <Tre`> but seriously
[16:58] <Tre`> getting a straight edge tattoo is like
[16:58] <Tre`> especially when you're a dipshit kid
[16:58] <Tre`> because you know he was totally just being anti-establishment and shit
[16:58] <Shinobi_Wilshire> haha
[16:59] <Shinobi_Wilshire> and now he's all like
[16:59] <Shinobi_Wilshire> HELLO ESTABLISHMENT!!

[17:03] <Shinobi_Wilshire> haha
[17:03] <Shinobi_Wilshire> like this is a new thing
[17:03] <Shinobi_Wilshire> I remember in 2003 when virtually every killer app got shuffled off to '04
[17:03] <Shinobi_Wilshire> halo 2, gt4, probably zelda
[17:03] <darkh23> yep every year you can count on this thread
[17:04] <darkh23> and the "man my wallet is gonna get raped this holiday" thread
[17:04] <darkh23> which will be coming soon
[17:04] <Shinobi_Wilshire> this is why I lol at people who get all hyped up over e3
[17:04] <Shinobi_Wilshire> yep
[17:04] <Shinobi_Wilshire> I mean if you enjoy wetting yourself over seeing games you won't be playing for 18 months, then fill your boots
[17:04] <Shinobi_Wilshire> but that's all e3 has become now
[17:05] <darkh23> haha yeah
[17:05] <darkh23> there's very few gaems that can excite me 2 years before release
[17:07] <stump> you aren't hyped for killzone 3?
[17:07] <Unison_> haha
[17:08] <KimiSleep> mornin

[17:08] <Shinobi_Wilshire> haha
[17:08] <Shinobi_Wilshire> I'm still recovering from 5 years of kz2 hype
[17:08] <Unison_> i love how the industry gave up on releasing any great games for 09
[17:09] <Unison_> very few AAA titles to come
[17:09] <Unison_> hope they delay AssCreed 2 
[17:09] <Shinobi_Wilshire> 2009 sums up this generation in a nutshell
[17:10] <Shinobi_Wilshire> all talk, little going on
[17:10] <Unison_> haha
[17:10] <Shinobi_Wilshire> while still paying ridiculous prices
[17:10] <Shinobi_Wilshire> for all the shit apple gets about their high prices
[17:10] <Shinobi_Wilshire> I mean, I could get an 8 gig iphone for 99 CANADIAN
[17:11] <Shinobi_Wilshire> while the will still costs 250 US
[17:11] <Shinobi_Wilshire> I mean really
[17:12] <Shinobi_Wilshire> shit, I bet iphone came out after the wii too
[17:12] <Shinobi_Wilshire> so it's managed to drop 80% in price in like 2 years
[17:13] <Shinobi_Wilshire> while 360's seen miniscule cuts, wii's at the same price, and ps3 might as well be at the same price cause nobody's buying anyway
[17:13] <Shinobi_Wilshire> lulz @ gaming

[17:46] <Tiduz> I doubt wii fit would help much
[17:46] <ddkawaii> smetimes u see a fine ass woman with a fat dude
[17:46] <ddkawaii> was wondering if the fatness added girth
[17:46] <Tiduz> Thenh e has cash probably
[17:46] <Tiduz> lolz
[17:46] <darkh23> eh you'd be surprised how much light exercise can help
[17:46] <Shinobi_Wilshire> LOL
[17:46] <stump> actually the us wii fit board has a ~330 pound limit so the board should work even if the software won't.
[17:46] <darkh23> especially if you aren't doing any
[17:46] <darkh23> lol

[17:46] <Tiduz> stump: Really?

[17:47] <ddkawaii> imagine me being 176cm

[18:05] <Unison_> also i can bring my dog
[18:05] <ddkawaii> do amusement parks still have corn dogs?
[18:05] <Unison_> they let you bring pets <3
[18:05] <Unison_> that one doesnt
[18:05] <ddkawaii> i remember corn dogs as a kid
[18:05] <ddkawaii> so greast
[18:05] <ddkawaii> greasy
[18:05] <Unison_> dunno about the others
[18:05] <ddkawaii> i wonder if i'd still like them
[18:05] <ddkawaii> arent corn dogs deep fried?
[18:05] <Nikashi> I love Corn Dogs
[18:05] <ddkawaii> or baked?
[18:05] <Nikashi> deep fried hotdogs dude
[18:05] <ddkawaii> lol
[18:05] <Nikashi> I still get hot dogs from 7-11
[18:05] <ddkawaii> nishi - weed + corn dogs + a half burrito + hagendas ice cream
[18:05] <Nikashi> because of the condiment bar
[18:06] <ddkawaii> so i have a question
[18:06] <ddkawaii> why are gays so militant these days
[18:06] <ddkawaii> listening to this show on xm radio
[18:06] <ddkawaii> and gays are like "we want our rights!"
[18:06] <ddkawaii> "we're an opressed minority"
[18:06] <ddkawaii> wtf
[18:06] <Unison_> ddk they are militant because that woman can marry a roller coaster
[18:06] <Unison_> and they cant marry each other
[18:06] <Unison_> lol
[18:06] <ddkawaii> lol
[18:07] <ddkawaii> dont all states have civil unions?
[18:07] <ddkawaii> that's the same as marriage
[18:07] <Tiduz> darkh23
[18:07] <ddkawaii> just a differnet name
[18:07] <Unison_> no
[18:07] <Tiduz> EU psn has Batman demo
[18:07] <Nikashi> ADAM AND EVE NOT SIX FLAGS AND EVE
[18:07] <Nikashi> no wait
[18:07] * Tiduz goes dl
[18:07] <ddkawaii> btw
[18:07] <Sea_Manky> I'm still working on a corn dog batter that tastes right
[18:07] <ddkawaii> why are only militant gay dudes so loud
[18:07] <Sea_Manky> can't quite get it
[18:07] <ddkawaii> do lesbians even speak out?
[18:07] <ddkawaii> i mean
[18:07] <Unison_> what
[18:07] <Nikashi> Lesbians aren't directly mentioned in the bible
[18:07] <Unison_> dykes are the most militant of all
[18:07] <ddkawaii> i'd be all for gay marriage IF:
[18:08] <Nikashi> Why does there need to be an if? Are you worried you might get gay married without someone telling you
[18:08] <ddkawaii> 1. only ugly women or gold digging women were allowed to be lesbians
[18:08] <Unison_> i support fat dyke/roller coaster unions
[18:09] <ddkawaii> 2. the dudes that are gay are the types that would compete for hot women if they were straight
[18:09] <ddkawaii> that way
[18:09] <ddkawaii> we get rid of ugly wmen
[18:09] <ddkawaii> and gold diggers
[18:09] * MarkMan23 has joined #GA
[18:09] <ddkawaii> and dudes that women may like
[18:09] <Unison_> i wonder if the roller coaster gets a tax break
[18:09] <ddkawaii> to free up the market
[18:09] <Unison_> once it marries that chick
[18:09] <ddkawaii> OR
[18:09] <ddkawaii> if th emajority of men
[18:09] <ddkawaii> had to become gay
[18:09] <ddkawaii> making it like 4 straight women for every 1 straight man
[18:09] <ddkawaii> that situation would be amazing
[18:09] <ddkawaii> maybe losers like that gym killer of women
[18:10] <ddkawaii> could get some pussy too
[18:10] <Nikashi> What if a nice looking girl gains wait
[18:10] <ddkawaii> lol@ no sex since 1984
[18:10] <Nikashi> does she have to learn to like pussy
[18:10] <ddkawaii> that was lulz
[18:10] <Unison_> i love that she rode it 1000 times
[18:10] <ddkawaii> nah
