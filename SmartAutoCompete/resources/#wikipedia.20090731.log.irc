[00:01] * Elfix has quit IRC
[00:03] <QCoder00> BTW Haggisburger  - Did you hear about Wikiversity's excursion into politics?
[00:03] <Haggisburger> no
[00:04] <QCoder00> http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Great_Repeal_Bill
[00:04] <Haggisburger> What are they up to?
[00:04] <Haggisburger> Hmm I go look at that when I d/c from here...
[00:05] <QCoder00> Apparently, a Westminster {{fact}} MP created a page on Wikipedia to get a list of Legislation that should be repealed
[00:05] <QCoder00> The Wikipedia page got deleted
[00:05] <QCoder00> It got Undeleted and transwikied
[00:05] <QCoder00> Given that it comes within the 'research' remit of Wikiversity
[00:05] <QCoder00> I.E I'ts policy research
[00:06] <Haggisburger> so ytf did wv get it?
[00:06] <Haggisburger> Oh.
[00:06] <QCoder00> Wikiversity ended up with as it had the best scope
[00:06] <QCoder00> It's not an article
[00:06] <QCoder00> It's not NEWS
[00:06] <QCoder00> It's not a textbook
[00:06] <QCoder00> Or Dictionary definiton
[00:06] <Haggisburger> its not research or study
[00:07] * joshs has joined #wikipedia
[00:07] <joshs> hello
[00:07] <QCoder00> Haggisburger: True
[00:07] <joshs> jscheunemann
[00:07] <QCoder00> Well it's policy research
[00:07] <joshs> ok
[00:07] * david-stone has joined #wikipedia
[00:07] * baltakatei has joined #wikipedia
[00:07] <QCoder00> At least that was the view of a WV Custodian I asked ;)
[00:07] <joshs> ok wtf
[00:07] <joshs> \
[00:07] <Haggisburger> Its an mp compiling his own list of bills to nail and using w* as a storage space.
[00:07] <Haggisburger> Balls to that!
[00:08] <QCoder00> It's not just the MP
[00:08] <QCoder00> There have been other suggestions since that
[00:08] <QCoder00> Although they do seem to be disproptionatly Nu Labor laws
[00:09] * Philippe|afk has joined #wikipedia
[00:09] <QCoder00> Maybe someone needs to find some objectionable Thatcher policy to nuke?
[00:09] * Philippe|afk is now known as Philippe|wiki
[00:09] <Haggisburger> the page should be removed in its entirety. Wiki* is not a place for political sh*t to rear its head.
[00:09] <QCoder00> Haggisburger: I suggest you take that view to #Wikiversity
[00:09] <QCoder00> :)
[00:10] <joshs> wikipedia could be hacked like facebook was
[00:10] <Haggisburger> i will. Right now.
[00:10] <QCoder00> :)
[00:10] <QCoder00> Thanks :)
[00:10] <joshs> what
[00:10] <joshs> ???
[00:11] <QCoder00> Haggisburger: Bear in mind Wikiversity has a lot of different policy
[00:11] <joshs> yep
[00:11] <joshs> !op shutdown
[00:12] <Prodego> yes?
[00:12] <Prodego> shutdown?
[00:12] <joshs> !op help
[00:12] <Golbez> what
[00:12] <Martinp23> joshs: what's up? :)
[00:12] <Prodego> what is it
[00:12] <joshs> nothing i work for the government to stop hackers
[00:12] <Rjd0060> What is it lassie?
[00:12] <Golbez> that's nice
[00:12] <KimiNewt> Well, looking at the WhiteKnightTwo little interview video, it seems like [[List of space travelers by name]] would be impossible to maintain
[00:12] <Golbez> why did you ping us twice
[00:13] <Emachman> joshs: please don't us that unless you need help.
[00:13] <Prodego> ok well we can't do anything about that, so no need to ping us unless you need something :)
[00:13] <Martinp23> joshs: in that case you might want to contact the appropriate people, not an irc channel :)
[00:13] <joshs> !op

[00:13] <Golbez> thanks
[00:13] <CSD_G1> troll shots himself in the foot
[00:13] <Golbez> most do
[00:13] <Killiondude> Julian spells himself in the mouth.
[00:13] <CSD_G1> shoots, even
[00:14] <Emachman> It's really funny when someone abuses the !_op stalkword.
[00:14] <Emachman> Kinda like the people who rob police stations.

[02:55] * HellDragon has quit IRC (Nick collision from services.)
[02:55] <Cyrius> depends on what you mean by projects
[02:55] * HellDragon_ is now known as HellDragon
[02:55] <Golbez> syntaxfree - you mean like wiktionary, wikisource, wikinews?
[02:55] <Golbez> or do you mean wikiprojects within Wikipedia, like the Countries project, Military History project, etc
[02:55] <syntaxfree> phone call. brb
[02:56] <syntaxfree> the latter.
[02:56] <Golbez> so far as I know, just start it, but surely there's some process mentioned at the wikiprojects page

[03:03] * HBYYB has joined #wikipedia
[03:03] <harej> you don't necessarily have to propose wikiprojects
[03:03] <harej> but it is a good idea
[03:04] * Killiondude has quit IRC ("Done.")
[03:05] <syntaxfree> sorry. I'm back.
[03:06] <syntaxfree> I'm not a heavy editor, but I've been at it for some time.
[03:07] * dungo has quit IRC (Operation timed out)
[03:08] <syntaxfree> Anyway, a few weeks ago I started a conversation on Reddit on how the "female privilege" article had been deleted, and it spawned a couple of more comments supporting the notion that there is some systematic slant to articles on gender issues in Wikipedia.
[03:09] * Ts3n2 has quit IRC ("Leaving...")
[03:09] <syntaxfree> they've also provided some less than praiseworthy information on Gwen Gale, the user who deleted that article, but that's besides the point.
[03:11] <syntaxfree> anyway, redditors are not really that heavy on wikipedia. but it might be interesting to convene active wikipedia editors that have certain opinions, but are somewhat dormant on them.
[03:13] <syntaxfree> I'm bothered about the overrepresentation on male-privilege feminist theory on male-related articles.
[03:14] <syntaxfree> for example,  the scholarship suggesting a homosociality-homosexuality spectrum should  indeed be represented on [[Homosociality]], but not by more than a sentence or two.
[03:15] <syntaxfree> "It has been suggested by feminist scholars such as Eve Sedwick that the boundaries between the social and the sexual are blurry, fuzzy" would be more than enough.
[03:16] <syntaxfree> specially considering there is no male psychology content on that article!
[03:19] <syntaxfree> Anyway, I feel there should be a project page listing articles on which the male perspective is important. There needs to  be talk about it. I'm not just gonna go guerrilla and edit everything I find objectionable out.
[03:20] <syntaxfree> I'm no specialist, and have strong enough feeling on female privilege and male-related problems that I might be a bad editor when on a bad mood.
[03:20] <syntaxfree> am I talking to myself here?
[03:21] <Golbez> Possibly.
[03:22] <syntaxfree> I'm gonna do a tentative edit of [[Homosociality#Use by Eve Sedgwick]] and post it on my user page, can I get feedback from IRCers?
[03:22] <Golbez> I say make the edit on the article itself; it's not like there's been an edit war. Justify your edits on its talk page.
[03:23] <syntaxfree> yeah. that's a good idea.
[03:23] <syntaxfree> there's a wider problem, though.
[03:23] * Golbez has left #wikipedia
[03:23] <syntaxfree> not related to just one article.
[03:23] * Golbez has joined #wikipedia
[03:23] <Golbez> whoops
[03:24] <syntaxfree> I don't want to just go guerilla. I'm afraid of overdoing it.

[03:30] * ocee has joined #wikipedia
[03:30] * ocee has quit IRC (Remote closed the connection)
[03:33] <syntaxfree> anyway, you do think that the proper way of raising awareness of the need for more male-specific perspectives on men's issues is bottom-up?
[03:33] <syntaxfree> editing individual articles and explaining in the respective talk pages?
[03:33] * Bloodshedder has joined #wikipedia
[03:34] <Golbez> hm
[03:34] <Golbez> you might want to ask the combating systemic bias wikiproject
[03:35] <harej> countering systemic bias
[03:35] <Golbez> This is either a systemic bias that needs confronting (ignoring the male perspective), or an overreaction to systemic bias (so much of the world is male-dominated, that people may overrepresent other views without realizing)
[03:35] <Golbez> add 'considered' between 'is' and 'male-dominated' =p
[03:36] <syntaxfree> the problem is more about feminist perspectives being overrepresented on men's issues-specific articles, not of the problems of male privilege throughout history and such being overrepresented in general.
[03:38] <Golbez> and then there's option 3: that the feminist perspective is overrepresented because the male perspective is underrepresented, and the solution may not be to remove one, but rather to add to the other.
[03:38] <syntaxfree> anyway, please have a read at this while I go grab a bite, if you're still interested in the whole systemic-bias-in-male-specific-articles issue I'm trying to raise.
[03:38] <Annemarie> You can stand under my umbrella.
[03:38] <syntaxfree> http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/8w0xv/male_privilege_is_an_article_on_wikipedia_there/
[03:38] <Annemarie> Is this like white oppressoin?
[03:38] <Annemarie> Oppression.
[03:38] <syntaxfree> Nope, it's not like white oppression at all.
[03:38] <Golbez> I'm oppressed by being white.
[03:38] <Annemarie> And male.
[03:39] <Annemarie> And if you're Christian, you're just fucked.
[03:39] <Golbez> It's an awful, oppressive responsibility, being superior. I have to make choices for all the other peoples, and, of course, the wimminfolk.
[03:39] * Interstate_39 has left #wikipedia
[03:39] <Golbez> Annemarie - ... what about Jewish? :|
[03:40] <syntaxfree> First of all, there is at least a significant portion of neuroscience and psychology that recognizes actual differences in many aspects.
[03:40] <Golbez> difference 1: one has a dinger, the other has a hoojha
[03:40] <Annemarie> Fucking Jews.
[03:40] <Golbez> -j but I like that too
[03:40] <syntaxfree> oh god, just look at the reddit article already?
[03:40] <Annemarie> lolreddit.
[03:41] <syntaxfree> oh well. whatever.
[03:41] <geniice> syntaxfree we hyave standards
[03:41] <syntaxfree> I'm not ready to start a crusade about this. Not on Wikipedia.
[03:41] * syntaxfree has left #wikipedia
[03:41] <Annemarie> There's an anti-Wikipedia link in the comments...
[03:41] <Annemarie> Last one.
[03:42] <Golbez> I thought he *was* ready to have a crusade about it.
[03:42] <Golbez> Also, he gave up way too fast in the face of a handful of jokes.
[03:42] * Leo_Cat has quit IRC (Remote closed the connection)
[03:42] <Annemarie> Having a penis disenfranchises you.
[03:42] <Golbez> shit
[03:42] <Golbez> ...
[03:42] <Annemarie> Yeah.
[03:42] * Leo_Cat has joined #wikipedia
[03:42] <Annemarie> Chop it off or tuck.
[03:42] <Golbez> what do you recomment, steak knife or deboning knife? (heh)
[03:42] <Golbez> recommend
[03:43] <Golbez> So a blog obsessing over Gwen Gale.
[03:43] <geniice> Annemarie not so it allows you to take part in that greatest of human atchivements a nation at arms
[03:43] <geniice> Golbez wha?
[03:43] <Golbez> I'm glad the only blog I had obsessing over me was poorly written and not really available on Google.
[03:43] <Golbez> And then we have Mr. Morrow, who had his own way of sharing his obsession with the world.
[03:44] * Radon has quit IRC (Connection timed out)
[03:45] <Golbez> It seems to weird to rage about a Wikipedia admin.
[03:45] * Emachman has joined #wikipedia
[03:46] <Golbez> so weird, rather. What's with my typing. :|
[03:46] <Golbez> There are *so* many ways to complain about a bad admin, that if you still can't get your way, your problem is with the whole Wikimedia structure, not just that admin. So to focus on the admin becomes sociopathic.
[03:46] <Annemarie> Girl, you crazy.
[03:47] <Golbez> Just because I whacked off li'l golbie don't mean I'm a girl
[03:47] <harej> is that the new name for your penis?
[03:47] <Golbez> actually I should just use the old name a girlfriend gave it, "Mr. Pepsi Can"
[03:47] <Luna-San> o.o

[03:57] <KimiNewt> isn't there one on wikinews?
[03:58] <JohnWittle> Yeah but, that's like, ALL news
[03:58] <KimiNewt> well you can take just of some category..
[03:59] <geniice> JohnWittle>	just take the feed off http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:In_the_news
[03:59] <KimiNewt> No reason to get news outside of wiki these days
[04:00] <geniice> oh in that case you want the signpost
[04:01] <geniice> actualy ITN isn't too good right now. Guinea-Bissau and SAT3 great but nothing about the issue in nigeria
[04:01] <KimiNewt> Heh, I meant that the news outlet where I get my news is wikinews/wikipedia
[04:01] * ABCD has quit IRC (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))

[04:13] <kmccoy> tehol, the best thing to do is to fix it yourself.  Otherwise, you could mention the concern on the talk page of the articles in question.
[04:14] <tehol> thanks kmccoy, i will mention it on the talk pages. I dont know which one is right, nor do I think I am qualified to find out, so the talk pages (which I always forget about!) would be the best thing for me to do
[04:15] <kmccoy> tehol, Wikipedia is not edited by experts.  You are as qualified as anyone else.
[04:16] <KimiNewt> what page is it?
[04:16] <tehol> kmccoy: it is a chemistry page, with a specific fact disagreement, one that seems fairly common. How could I possibly be qualified to do the research this?
[04:16] <kmccoy> I'm not trying to discourage you from using the talk page, I'm just trying to encourage you to be bold and jump in. :)
[04:17] <KimiNewt> There's actually a wikiproject chemistry IRC channel, not sure if people are in that regularly though..
[04:17] <tehol> it is the aluminium sulfate page, along with the stypitic or antihemorrhagic page. one says that aluminium sulfate is an alum, the other says no
[04:17] <kmccoy> tehol, well, you could also mention the problem to the wikiproject chemistry.
[04:19] <kmccoy> My point is just that no one can edit those pages and say "I'm an expert, therefore it's x."  They'd need to support any controversial edits with facts from reliable sources.  And that's something that, in theory, anyone can do.  Although I will grant you that someone who is familiar with the field may have an easier time finding such a source.

[05:25] <Gracenotes> gwern: oh hai, earlier you had recommended the hellsing OVAs over the episodes
[05:25] <gwern> yes
[05:26] <Gracenotes> and -- watching the anime now, I'm not sure why... I like them both
[05:26] <gwern> incidentally, I was thinking: a hilarious marathon viewing schedule might be to alternate episodes of _Aria_ and _Higurashi_, and then break for _Grave of the Fireflies_ and _My Neighbor Totoro_
[05:26] <gwern> Gracenotes: well, the tv series was pretty popular; it's not bad except in comparison with the OVA
[05:26] <Gracenotes> episodes don't have the same computer animation and FPS, but both feel the same
[05:27] <Gracenotes> gwern: Fireflies and Totoro are a good match! or at least Ghibli thought so

[05:34] <Algebraist-en> it's sometimes frustrating that people take me for an algebraist rather than a book
[05:34] <gwern> Gracenotes: I've seen bits and pieces in passing

[05:35] <AngryParsley> have you guys seen http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cat_Returns ?

[05:35] <gwern> AngryParsley: sure. it's great
[05:35] <AngryParsley> yes, it is :)

[05:42] <Gracenotes> hm.. I see the "look" part more than the "act" part
[05:42] <gwern> which is nonsense upon stilts. if you want to write about a relationship with 2 girly-boys, just be honest and make it 2 girls
[05:44] <Gracenotes> it might have something (not *everything*) to do with turn-ons and the ideas about gender and sexuality people have.
[05:45] <Gracenotes> demographics, no?
[05:45] <AngryParsley> linux sucks so much for desktop use
[05:45] <gwern> Gracenotes: what sort of demographics?
[05:46] <gwern> it seems pretty universal among teenage girls, at least
[05:46] <Gracenotes> there you go then
[05:46] <Gracenotes> or, a not-so-superficial facet, I'd say it's probably cultural
[05:47] <gwern> I don't have any good theories about this; the whole vampire/bishonen/yaoi thing is a little hard for me to explain
[05:47] <Gracenotes> that is, cultural in Japan the same way (say) puritanism or capitalism is cultural in the US. (weak analogy)
[05:48] <gwern> the biological evidence is also confusing; what to make of the fact that genes for masculine attractiveness are directly counterproductive to the genes for feminine? or that many if not most males will not reproduce, while females will? or any of a dozen other tidbits like that?
[05:49] <gwern> or of the cultural history of virgun nuns married to jesus, and the quip about _twilight_'s magical man respecting the protagonist's virginity etc

[05:52] <Cyrius> I recall something about that coming up with genetic predisposition to homosexuality

[08:20] <Sarajevo> Has anyone thought what would happen if someone coded a worm that would make mess on wikipedia and edit every article, put some garbage and so on ?
[08:20] <Sarajevo> what's the protection against that ?
[08:20] <Annemarie> It'd be pretty easy to do.
[08:21] <FastLizard4> Easy to stop, too.
[08:21] <Sarajevo> yes
[08:21] <Sarajevo> how ?
[08:21] <FastLizard4> Ratelimits.
[08:21] <FastLizard4> You can't make more than x edits in y seconds.
[08:21] <Sarajevo> if you have like 100K worms that are owning wikipedia
[08:21] <OverlordQ> ratelimits, blacklists, AntiBot measures
[08:21] <FastLizard4> Unless you're marked as a bot
[08:21] <FastLizard4> Then there's AbuseFilter
[08:21] <Sarajevo> for example, they can put even a link that would lead to the executable
[08:22] <FastLizard4> Sarajevo: Doesn't work that way :)
[08:22] <OverlordQ> unconfirmed accounts have to solve a captcha before adding external links
[08:22] <Sarajevo> Hmm
[08:22] <FastLizard4> I'm sure it's been tried before.
[08:22] <Sarajevo> once I edited one article called 'suicide' and after 5 mins they changed it back
[08:22] <FastLizard4> Of course, why would you want to do that?
[08:22] <Sarajevo> no
[08:22] <FastLizard4> I'd find it much more profitible to make a worm to, say, steal credit card numbers than make a mess on Wikipedia
[08:23] <Sarajevo> I'm just asking because malware coders can use wikipedia easily to spread mlaware
[08:23] <FastLizard4> Sarajevo: How?
[08:23] <OverlordQ> oh ho ho! I vandalized wikipedia, it'll take them 5 minutes to clean it up!
[08:23] <Sarajevo> I changed one word, OverlordQ
[08:23] <Sarajevo> god damn
[08:23] <FastLizard4> OverlordQ: Not unless JD is awake ;)
[08:23] <OverlordQ> Wasn't refering to you, was referring to the worm writers
[08:23] * Cyrius has joined #wikipedia
[08:23] <Sarajevo> ah
[08:24] <Sarajevo> can you put links in the 'discussion'
[08:24] <FastLizard4> Can't put links anywhere.
[08:24] <FastLizard4> Any external link left by unconfirmed accounts and anons triggers anti-bot mechanisms
[08:24] <FastLizard4> Namely, the CAPTCHA
[08:25] <Sarajevo> you can put something like hxxp www.sfdfsd.com/worm.exe
[08:25] <FastLizard4> Sarajevo: But how would that spread the worm?
[08:25] <Annemarie> OverlordQ: It'd be pretty easy to write a decent vandalize.py
[08:25] * Heretic has quit IRC (Remote closed the connection)
[08:25] <FastLizard4> Annemarie: Isn't that was Grawp uses? :P
[08:25] <FastLizard4> s/was/what/
[08:25] <Sarajevo> can you upload a pic to wikipedia ?
[08:25] <OverlordQ> Annemarie: not saying it's hard to write something that could vandalize random wikis
[08:25] <OverlordQ> Sarajevo: yes
[08:25] <FastLizard4> Sarajevo: Yes, but pictures aren't EXEs
[08:26] <Sarajevo> yes
[08:26] <Annemarie> Even if you attacked a specific wiki, it'd be pretty easy.
[08:26] <Sarajevo> but you can code a worm that would put for example pic and link to itself on wikipedia
[08:26] <FastLizard4> Sarajevo: But... pictures aren't executable
[08:26] <Sarajevo> yes I know
[08:26] <Sarajevo> but people would type it
[08:26] <FastLizard4> Why?
[08:26] <Sarajevo> why not
[08:26] <Annemarie> Go test it out, Sarajevo.
[08:26] <Annemarie> You won't break anything.
[08:26] <FastLizard4> Because... you don't need to?
[08:27] <OverlordQ> type what? copy this strange .exe url into the browser, replace the xx's with tt and hit enter?
[08:27] <Annemarie> Sounds like a Wikipedian to me.
[08:27] <Sarajevo> OverlordQ, that was just an example
[08:27] <OverlordQ> they'd be better off hiring a botnet to send spam with it attached
[08:27] <Sarajevo> I'm pretty sure someone will use wikipedia for spreading malware
[08:27] <Prodego> there is only one way to do this sucessfully, and it would require a lot of planning
[08:27] <FastLizard4> Sarajevo: Technically impossible.
[08:28] <Sarajevo> it's the easiest way to do that because it's popular, a lot of noobs from africa reads it and so on
[08:28] <Prodego> FastLizard4: no, no it isn't

[08:29] * RockMO has quit IRC
[08:29] <FastLizard4> Prodego: If you tried to upload the virus, you'd somehow have to upload it using an authorizeed file extension then change the MIME type to an executable one
[08:29] <Prodego> FastLizard4: no you wouldn't
[08:30] <FastLizard4> Prodego: Besides, MW checks MIME types iirc.
[08:30] <Sarajevo> I can code PoC just to convince you how it's easy to use wikipedia for spreading malware
[08:30] <Prodego> FastLizard4: which is why you wouldn't do it that way
[08:30] <Sarajevo> if you want of course
[08:30] <Prodego> Sarajevo: there is no way YOU can use wikipedia for spreading malware
[08:30] <FastLizard4> Sarajevo: You can try, but you won't get very far
[08:30] <Sarajevo> I just dont want to get arrested
[08:30] <FastLizard4> You won't
[08:31] <Prodego> nor is there a way for FastLizard4 to

[08:43] <FastLizard4> Using a Google Bomb is probably much easier.
[08:44] <OverlordQ> well, those one researchers recently proved you can use wikis to store payloads
[08:44] <OverlordQ> where they vandalized a metric ton of wikis to use as their storage cloud, got a lot of flak, and then disappeared
[08:44] <FastLizard4> OverlordQ: How many ran MW?

[08:51] <I_am_Keegan> Right right
[08:52] <Killiondude> For some reason I have [[onion ring]] on my watchlist.
[08:52] <opello> is it 'kosher' to update an image with a newer image that is available on flickr as CC-BY-NC-SA?  that, subjectively, is more of a portrait than a snapshot?
[08:53] <Killiondude> You can't use NC on any wikimedia projects.
[08:53] <Killiondude> Well, as a "free image".
[08:53] <opello> the current is public domain ... so it's probably not worthwhile then?
[08:54] <Killiondude> I think most would rather have the public domain image than something that isn't a free image.
[08:54] <opello> that's what i figured
[08:55] <opello> so if i can get the photographer to relicense it to CC-BY-SA, can i upload it?  or is there somewhere i should jus be reading for this kind of information?  i've looked a bit ...

[08:56] <Killiondude> You can ask the photographer to relicense it like you said. Sometimes they do.
[09:00] <opello> So I guess there's the second question -- should I even bother trying to get it CC-BY-NC if the current is public domain?
[09:01] <Killiondude> Its always nice to have options. If you upload this new file to Commons, for example, other language Wikipedias or other people could decide which image they want to use.

[10:16] <Gracenotes> Crouching Plot Hidden Genre, eh?
[10:16] <Gwern-away> Gracenotes: the first episode of Aria the Natural depicts the ruler of all cats on Mars, which is a giant black bipedal cat larger than 3 humans, and centuries old
[10:16] <Gwern-away> he is assisted by his preternaturally long-lived assistant small cats, who every year slink off to assisst him in his revels
[10:17] <Gracenotes> awwwwww.
[10:17] <Gwern-away> THERE IS NO NON-SINISTER EXPLANATION
[10:17] <Gwern-away> the humans live lovely lies
[10:17] <Gwern-away> they are eloi
[10:17] <Gracenotes> how much is there
[10:18] <Gracenotes> three seasons spanning 52 episodes and one OVA
[10:18] <Gracenotes> hm
[10:18] <Gwern-away> which explains why in the distant future with complete terraforming of mars, people still make their careers as bakers or gondoliers - they aren't actually working
[10:18] <Gwern-away> (yeah, there's a lot. the quality is surprisingly consistent too)
[10:18] <Gracenotes> you plan on watching it all
[10:18] <Gracenotes> ... -ka?
[10:18] <Gracenotes> :/
[10:18] <Gwern-away> it's a good antidote to my usual fare of cynicism and gore
[10:18] <Gwern-away> I can only watch one a day, though
[10:19] <Gracenotes> speaking of which, do you think anything of Kyo Kara Maoh?
[10:19] <Gwern-away> never heard of it, I think
[10:19] <Gwern-away> I'm still trying to figure out why they took half of venice to mars, though
[10:19] <Gracenotes> well, kyou, ãã‚‡ã†, or with that horizontal diacritic..
[10:20] <Gwern-away> 'Gwendal'? oh good grief
[10:20] <Gwern-away> go go engrish...
[10:21] <Gwern-away> 'While spending his first night at the castle, Yuri encounters Wolfram von Bielefeld, who immediately marks Yuri as an unworthy heir to the throne, and claims that Yuri's mother was of poor breeding, as well as being human. Yuri reacts to the insult by slapping Wolfram across the left cheek, which, unbeknownst to Yuri, is the traditional way to propose marriage among the nobles of the Great Demon Kingdom. Though Yuri insists that ...
[10:21] <Gwern-away> ... he is not interested in men, Wolfram takes the proposal very seriously, becoming a jealous, critical fiancÃ©, constantly complaining about how Yuri is a wimp of a fiancÃ©e, to great comic effect.' <-- DO NOT WANT
[10:21] <AngryParsley> Gwern-away: have you ever watched legend of galactic heroes?
[10:21] <Gracenotes> go go, you it to do can!
[10:21] <Gwern-away> AngryParsley: no; think it's in my torrents though
[10:22] <Gracenotes> Gwern-away: yes, it's childish, but it seems like oodles of fun
[10:22] <AngryParsley> Gwern-away: http://logh.clintonthegeek.com/wiki/Main_Page
[10:22] <Gwern-away> also, now that I think of it, Gracenotes, what are you doing up? I thought you were EST?
[10:22] <Gracenotes> it's only 3:22 AM
[10:22] <AngryParsley> oh look flash videos of every episode
[10:22] <Gracenotes> Gwern-away: and plus, you're not susceptible to shonen ai, you don't know what it's like! ;_;
[10:23] <Gwern-away> AngryParsley: I am not going to watch my anime in flash...
[10:23] <AngryParsley> heh, well if you wanted instant gratification...
[10:23] <Gwern-away> Gracenotes: that is true. I got over my shonen ai in middle school
[10:23] <AngryParsley> it's there
[10:23] <Gracenotes> lol.
[10:23] <Gwern-away> AngryParsley: heck if I wanted to watch some anime I'd just watch some more aria the natural. I've got like 25 eps left
[10:23] <AngryParsley> I haven't seen that one
[10:24] * FastLizard4 is now known as NCC-1701-E
[10:24] <Gwern-away> AngryParsley: not sure I could recommend it. small doses, definitely, aria is best taken in
[10:24] <AngryParsley> oh
[10:25] <Gwern-away> what to liken aria to... it's slice-of-life, kind of like 5 centimeters in its art focus, but kind of highschoolish if highschool were venice and the students apprentice gondoliers. a bit like minami-ke minus the sexual stuff, I guess

[10:28] <Gwern-away> let's see... why does each gondola company have a figurehead cat?
[10:28] <Gwern-away> well, the cats are always going on the gondolas; clearly they're spying on the city or customers
[10:28] <Gwern-away> perhap they are Caith Sith's intelligence agents
[10:28] <Gracenotes> are the cats cute?
[10:28] <AngryParsley> if you like opera and you like space battles with 30k ships, you might like legend of galactic heroes
[10:28] <Gwern-away> no. at least, not the one you see most of
[10:29] <AngryParsley> each space battle is set to a different piece of classical music
[10:29] <AngryParsley> the first is ravel's bolero
[10:29] <Gwern-away> honestly, the Aria cat is a shockingly ugly design
[10:29] <Gracenotes> like, sphynx ugly? (don't tell raul I said that)
[10:29] <Gwern-away> the first few episodes I kept wondering when they would reveal he wasn't a cat or something like that, until I eventually realized that apparently he was supposed to just be a cat
[10:30] <Gwern-away> Gracenotes: nah. he just looks like a fat little lapdog

[10:31] <aeromax> Vaguely related to the project.
[10:31] <aeromax> I've had a normal-sized regular-persons phone for a while.
[10:31] <Gracenotes> Gwern-away: lolwut
[10:31] <Gwern-away> 'Because blue-eyed cats are considered lucky on Aqua, all undine companies have a blue-eyed cat as a mascot, who is given the title President.[37] Cats on Aqua have been bred to be as intelligent as humans, though they cannot speak' <-- isn't that creepy?
[10:32] <aeromax> Regular-persons buttons and all that, it has a phone and whatnot
[10:32] <aeromax> however I've gotten a new phone
[10:32] <aeromax> which is all HIGH TECH FULL KEYBOARD and such
[10:32] <aeromax> the problem here is that I don't text message or go online from my phone
[10:33] <Gwern-away> I'm afriad we don't know anything about their return policies, then
[10:33] <aeromax> so it's just 20 keys I'll never use, and the ones I will use are tiny.

[10:35] <aeromax> I have to make up my mind in less than six hours.
[10:35] <Gracenotes> I suppose I have to suggest "an hero"
[10:35] <Gwern-away> which in the long run will be an extraordinarily charitable action

[10:36] <aeromax> in some seriousness though I'm freaking out about the phone
[10:36] <Gwern-away> run the numbers
[10:37] <aeromax> the new one was supposed to be THE SHIT except it's just turning out to be SHIT
[10:37] <aeromax> for me at least
[10:37] <aeromax> :/
[10:37] <aeromax> neither option is going to cost me any more money than the other
[10:37] <aeromax> bulky high-tech phone that's hard to use or compact low-tech phone that I can use?
[10:38] <Gracenotes> planned obsolescence. learn to love it.
[10:38] <Gwern-away> how much do you estimate the lack-of-eas to cost you?
[10:38] <aeromax> I dunno.
[10:38] <aeromax> Well, the one thing that I like about the new one
[10:38] <aeromax> is that it has a USB line
[10:38] <AngryParsley> get an iphone
[10:38] <aeromax> so I can take pictures/video on the phone and transfer them to my computer
[10:38] <AngryParsley> it is the best phone in the universe
[10:38] <Gwern-away> how much do you estimate you'll use the high tech features? keep in mind online access means you can do anything - look up maps when you're lost, send emails, etc
[10:38] <aeromax> unlike the old phone, where I have to dick around with the carrier to get anything off it
[10:38] <Gwern-away> AngryParsley: yes yes, as long as, you've said, one doesn't mind being apple's bitch

[11:02] <aeromax> (am I being a pest?)
[11:02] <denelson83> YES
[11:02] <denelson83> and so am I
[11:02] <AngryParsley> mmmm iphone
[11:02] <aeromax> aargh
[11:03] <AngryParsley> you should have gotten a burner
[11:03] <aeromax> the thing about this, though, is that my mum was paying for the service
[11:03] <aeromax> and so this whole transfer thign
[11:03] <AngryParsley> a cheap phone that does nothing but make calls
[11:03] <aeromax> **thing

[11:03] <denelson83> you purchased a rotten durian
[11:03] <aeromax> involved shit-tons of drama and running around the city for no good reason
[11:03] <aeromax> and I get the end resuly
[11:03] <aeromax> **result
[11:03] <aeromax> and it's this turd
[11:03] <AngryParsley> why did you pick that phone?
[11:03] <AngryParsley> also isn't there a backing-out period for the phone contract?
[11:04] <aeromax> well, it's not the contract so much as the phone
[11:04] <AngryParsley> can't you return it or something?
[11:04] <denelson83> What kind of phone is it again?
[11:04] <AngryParsley> http://www.amazon.com/LG-Lotus-LX600-Phone-Sprint/dp/B001MYLXF4
[11:04] <aeromax> I might be able to switch back to the old one, but that might take a week again
[11:04] <AngryParsley> denelson83: ^^ that one
[11:04] <AngryParsley> why does it take a week?
[11:04] <AngryParsley> you go to the phone store, swap phones, you go home
[11:04] <aeromax> it's all the activation and sending them through the post and crap
[11:05] <AngryParsley> can't you pull the SIM and use it in another phone?
[11:05] <denelson83> aeromax, what kind of phone are you using again?
[11:06] <aeromax> a Lotus
[11:06] <aeromax> http://www.amazon.com/LG-Lotus-LX600-Phone-Sprint/dp/B001MYLXF4
[11:06] <denelson83> LG Lotus, eh?

[11:08] <AngryParsley> aeromax: why not buy a cheap-ass phone (or borrow an old GSM phone from someone) and put the SIM in it while you wait for the phone swap?
[11:08] <aeromax> http://www.wirelessprocurement.com/store/il/images/P/samsung_m320.jpg
[11:08] <aeromax> this is my old phone
[11:09] <AngryParsley> ok, so you still have that phone. put the SIM in that thing while you swap out phones
[11:09] <aeromax> and...
[11:09] <aeromax> do you think sprint has some kind of dickery that would prevent it from recognizing it as the same phone
[11:09] <denelson83> dunno
[11:09] <Gwern-away> when dealign with telecoms, the conservative assumption is the most evil assumption
[11:10] <AngryParsley> Although the current Sprint PCS service is CDMA, the original Washington area network used GSM.
[11:10] <AngryParsley> oh nevermind
[11:10] <AngryParsley> have fun getting screwed
[11:10] * OverlordQ has at&t but services is tied to the card rather then the phone
[11:10] * fujnky has joined #wikipedia
[11:11] <AngryParsley> OverlordQ: yeah, GSM uses SIM cards. some phones are locked to a certain carrier's SIM cards, but you can unlock them
[11:11] <AngryParsley> and you can put your SIM card in any unlocked phone and use it
[11:11] * denelson83 calls it "at&fuck you"
[11:13] <AngryParsley> at&t sucks, but at least you can upgrade phones without dealing with them
[11:14] <AngryParsley> or if you're sly you can get a phone with a contract, then unlock the phone and cancel the contract. depending on the state/country/whatever, the carrier can be limited to what they can charge for cancellation

[21:31] <malapropist> wow well this channel certainly is exciting when wikipedia isn't down
[21:31] <malapropist> earlier this morning, thanks to the downtime, i discovered answers.com.
[21:31] <PeterSymonds> Pretty much. :)
[21:31] <malapropist> i think i'll go there from now on.
[21:32] <malapropist> also apparently there's this whole other "
[21:32] <malapropist> "internet" thing
[21:32] <malapropist> all kinds of information on that.
[21:33] <Qb_Master> eh, wikipedia's where you go to get information before you get information :p
[21:34] <malapropist> lol true
[21:34] <malapropist> everyone says don't use wikipedia as a source, but for a lot of stuff... it has its OWN sources
[21:34] <malapropist> i just use those
[21:34] <kmccoy> Isn't answers.com just a wikipedia mirror?
[21:34] <malapropist> apparently
[21:34] <malapropist> i actually didn't realize that till today
[21:35] <malapropist> i thought it was its own thing

[21:35] <malapropist> so has an article been written about today's downtime yet?
[21:35] <Qb_Master> lol
[21:35] <kmccoy> Maybe it's one of those sites that serves info from multiple sources, like a dictionary and thesaurus and wikipedia, etc.
[21:35] <Qb_Master> cause ya know, that's necessary
[21:36] <kmccoy> I can't load any web pages at the moment to look.
[21:36] <Qb_Master> I think we should make it a rule that nobody should be allowed to cite sources that people can't read without paying for...
[21:37] * Sunwind has joined #wikipedia
[21:37] <Qb_Master> that crap drives me nuts
[21:37] <Qb_Master> I find an interesting tidbit and go to the reference only to find they want me to pay $29.95 for the article :/
[21:38] <shimgray> Qb_Master: the logical corrolary to that would be to ban anything not on the internet, as well. screw that.
[21:38] <Qb_Master> well it sucks either way...haha
[21:38] <Qb_Master> at least with a book you can borrow it from a library\
[21:38] <Qb_Master> a magazine you can read it at the store or borrow it from a friend
[21:39] <Qb_Master> but you can't just 'borrow' say a scientific paper from a journal for your own viewing pleasure
[21:39] <Qb_Master> thus it makes it kinda hard to prove that a reference is truly valid
[21:40] <malapropist> can you look it up at the library? at least school libraries often have access to these databases
[21:41] <malapropist> i don't know though
[21:41] <Qb_Master> if I were at a university perhaps I could do that
[21:41] <Qb_Master> sometimes I luck out and find someone who is at a university who can fetch a paper for me
