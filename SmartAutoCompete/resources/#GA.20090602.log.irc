[01:19] <jett\PRESETWAGGLECOMMANDS> all right
[01:19] <Kabouter> Guess you're right Tiduz, also on PC
[01:19] <ghst> dice have abandoned their pitiful million selling battlefield franchise for the likes of bad company and mirrors edge
[01:19] <DrForester> Ubisoft should have a full CGI presentation where everythign is presented by The Rabbids
[01:19] <Kabouter> In that case, I am there.
[01:19] * minty has joined #GA
[01:19] <Kabouter> Because it seems really cool

[01:19] <Y2Kev> Splinter Cell looks pretty good
[01:19] <Tiduz> thats true :(
[01:19] <jett\PRESETWAGGLECOMMANDS> real talk tiduz
[01:19] <Kabouter> And Mercenaries 2 looked TERRIBLE
[01:19] <jett\PRESETWAGGLECOMMANDS> i don't know what game are you talking about
[01:19] <jett\PRESETWAGGLECOMMANDS> but real talk
[01:19] <Tiduz> Saboteur
[01:19] <jett\PRESETWAGGLECOMMANDS> superior pc version FTW
[01:19] <Kabouter> Mercenaries 2 was just a hideous game
[01:20] <Shuri> saboteur looks like a rental
[01:20] <Tiduz> I had a bug on 360 kab
[01:20] <Tiduz> couldnt progress
[01:20] <Shuri> someone should had yelled that
[01:20] <Tiduz> pos game

[01:20] <Tiduz> Raiden looks like a terminator ffs
[01:20] <Tiduz> why not mgs4 suit
[01:20] <Shuri> i managed to load the forums, i read something about a mgs side story game for the 360 ?
[01:21] <Shuri> why not a new franchise :(
[01:21] <Tiduz> ps360
[01:21] <Y2Kev> the problem with the countdown
[01:21] <Tiduz> multiplat
[01:21] <Tiduz> action game
[01:21] <Y2Kev> is that it overloads
[01:21] <Diablos> so  that's it for now?
[01:21] <Y2Kev> every time the countdown is up
[01:21] <EviLore> mirror's edge is a great game
[01:21] <Kabouter> I wish they hadn't put combat sections in
[01:21] <EviLore> but I want battlefield 3 pc exclusive, yeah
[01:21] <Tiduz> EviLore agreed
[01:21] <Diablos> ME and SSX
[01:21] <Tiduz> isnt ME2 confirmed?
[01:21] <Diablos> that's it!
[01:21] <Kabouter> THEN Mirror's Edge would be a GREAT game
[01:21] <Shuri> I'm starting to wonder if kojima just wasnt lucky with mg
[01:21] <Tiduz> why didnt they show it :/
[01:21] <Kabouter> Mirror's Edge as it stands is a good game
[01:21] <Kabouter> Nothing more

[01:29] <Unison> nina simone stump
[01:29] <Rorschach> and C) league approval
[01:29] <Somnia> I really hope we have to manage the cap
[01:29] <Unison> i think the version was from a Verve Remixed cd
[01:29] <Rorschach> Somnia: the one downside to that is that al davis screwed the raiders for future cap space
[01:29] <Rorschach> lots of dead cap
[01:29] <Rorschach> :(
[01:29] <Somnia> ya
[01:29] <Wes_> I was promised BF3 this year damn it :(
[01:30] <stump> Unison: that absolutely was not Nina Simone.
[01:30] <Somnia> I feel sorry for sabel and his redskins also
[01:30] <jake3hk> sry wes
[01:30] <Unison> it was
[01:30] <jake3hk> no fifa either :(
[01:30] <Rorschach> no one is more disappointed about bf3 than me
[01:30] <Rorschach> but it wasn't promised
[01:30] <Unison> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22kPiPILteQ
[01:30] <Unison> i dunno
[01:30] <minty> bf3 360 version git!
[01:30] <Unison> let me listen again
[01:30] <Wes_> I may even install BF2 and try that new patch
[01:30] <Unison> i thought it had some distortion effects added
[01:30] <Somnia> 600k of ea active in 2 weeks was suprising
[01:31] <Somnia> I thought itd do like 500k first month
[01:31] <stump> Unison: there was a d'n'b-ish backbeat too :p
[01:31] <Unison> not really
[01:31] <Unison> yeah stump
[01:31] <itsgreen> btw MS conf thread: 214,247 views in 5 hours.. pretty good
[01:31] <jake3hk> New Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti has set his sights on bringing the European Cup to Stamford Bridge. Ancelotti, who quit as AC Milan coach on Sunday, twice won the Champions League as manager of the Rossoneri and wants to bring that "beautiful sensation" to Chelsea
[01:31] <stump> i have the trailer here so i will rewatch to check
[01:31] * Reno- has quit IRC (Software caused connection abort)
[01:32] <stump> I think you're right. I think it's the Simone vocals, it's just the music is a good bit different which is what threw me.
[01:32] <kassatsu> jett: http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/696050/Metal-Gear-Solid-Rising-Not-Exclusive-To-360.html

[01:32] <Unison> though i dont remember where i heard that mix, it might be a new mix

[01:39] <minty> btw ami ain't no pseduo-man. ain't nobody who looks like mario be pseudo-man
[01:39] <Y2Kev> I think Asscrud 2 might be at sony's conference
[01:39] <jett\amir0x-am-cry> there are amir0x pix out there?
[01:40] <Shuri> he did some splinter cell video
[01:40] <Shuri> on youtube
[01:40] <jett\amir0x-am-cry> y2kev: i doubt it, sony rarely shows 3rd party crap at their conferences
[01:40] <Y2Kev> jett\amir0x-am-cry: but they have a CG trailer
[01:40] <Y2Kev> and they didn't show it anywhere yet
[01:40] <Y2Kev> ubisoft needs to whore it out
[01:40] <minty> yeah. besides, anyone who pushes his/her mom ain't no pseudo-man
[01:40] <jett\amir0x-am-cry> y2kev: aw snap, well if they have a CG trailer then it's perfect for Sony
[01:40] <Shuri> and do home invasions
[01:40] <Shuri> for drug money.
[01:40] <Y2Kev> since sony is not in the interest of showing any of its games anymore
[01:40] <Y2Kev> lol
[01:41] <Shuri> 'over 20, but its no big deal really'
[01:41] <Jide> sony are going to show alot of trailers y2kev hehe
[01:41] <minty> maybe sony will show that epic game!
[01:41] <Y2Kev> Jide: how can they not show gt5
[01:41] <Y2Kev> da fug
[01:41] <Shuri> jett\amir0x-am-cry: http://www.okcupid.com/profile?u=Amir0x
[01:41] <Jide> they're not?
[01:41] <jett\amir0x-am-cry> GT5 not being there would be immense fail
[01:42] <minty> the can't cause it'll look worse than flopza3
[01:42] <Unison> they have to show PSP one too
[01:42] <Grecco> They will show GT PSP but not GT5
[01:42] <minty> comes bundled with psp go!
[01:42] <avcables> phortza 3 looks awesome
[01:42] <Unison> cut your own trailers haha
[01:42] <Unison> that trailer was hilarious
[01:42] <avcables> hahaha
[01:42] <avcables> it looked like an old 80's mazda commercial
[01:42] <avcables> or whatever
[01:43] <jett\amir0x-am-cry> flopza3 looks aorund GT5P levels to be honest
[01:43] <Unison> lol
[01:43] <jett\amir0x-am-cry> a little worse
[01:43] <jett\amir0x-am-cry> but pretty good
[01:43] <jett\amir0x-am-cry> considering

[02:08] <avcables> i laughed
[02:08] <avcables> i cried
[02:08] <avcables> it was a comedy in shakespearean times
[02:08] <DrForester> "nintendo is doomed" comments are lulz
[02:08] * Andvary has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[02:08] <Unison> i thought it was incredibly lame
[02:08] <Unison> haha

[02:09] <DuckRacer> I personally loved the conference, except for most of the natal crap
[02:09] <Tiduz> only thing i went :o
[02:09] <Tiduz> was Crackdown 2
[02:09] <Tiduz> i love me some crackdown
[02:09] <itsgreen> Holy frick...
[02:09] <Unison> "For the guys complaining abou the body recognition with the avatar: Don't forget that it was probably from the dashboard, so maybe it was memory constricted."
[02:09] <Jide> yeah saying it's over for nintendo is pretty silly 
[02:09] <Unison> yeah Crackdown 2 won
[02:09] <itsgreen> ODST = full retail = 60 bucks
[02:09] <Unison> GOTS so far
[02:09] <DuckRacer> The Milo demo was impressive technically

[02:09] <Tiduz> i hope natal flops
[02:09] <Unison> it  will be so broken

[02:10] <itsgreen> 30 bucks seems fine, but maybe there is 10 hours of single player content in it
[02:10] <itsgreen> but I thought they were talking about 4 hours
[02:10] <happy_phantom> you ever wonder what an avatar's shoe looks like?
[02:10] <Jide> $60 is nothing to them

[02:20] <EviLore> "Nintendo doesn't know there's a market for non motion controlled games? So whats the virtual console and classic controller for? What about Punch out or Fire Emblem?" -obijkenobi
[02:20] <Tiduz> Tomorrow is ps3s wiimote
[02:20] <Tiduz> :(
[02:20] <Schw0wsers> I can't picture it being used in very deep games though
[02:20] <FirewalkR> im counting on $100 for the xbox camera
[02:20] <Amir0x> it was so funny today when I came from work and looked at IRC, i had like a billion private messages
[02:20] <Max\YouAreTheController> One Waggle FUture
[02:20] <Tiduz> Tiger wooods will prob use it
[02:20] <Grecco> PS3 Wiimote will abe awesome Tiduz
[02:20] <Unison> then again, if it gets a girl to let you shove your head up her ass and pretend you're an elephant
[02:20] <Schw0wsers> Seems destined for shallow minigames, but I guess that's the point
[02:20] <Unison> maybe worth it
[02:20] <Amir0x> i thought Microsoft announced they purchased Sony or some shit
[02:20] <Somnia> I hope Sony doesnt show any wiiremote shit
[02:20] <itsgreen> I wonder if there are cursing people at Sony's office
[02:20] <Amir0x> but alas, it was just voice requests
[02:20] <DrForester> THis is really going to be the end result of Natal...
[02:20] <DrForester> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCCx7zANsGE
[02:20] <Tiduz> Maybe i hope so
[02:20] <Tiduz> it seems that
[02:20] <Tiduz> to survive
[02:21] <EviLore> I'd really love to just ban nintendo from gaf
[02:21] <Tiduz> you have to go wiimote
[02:21] <Tiduz> lol
[02:21] <EGM92> thanks Amirox
[02:21] <EGM92> you're not THAT popular
[02:21] <Jide> tiduz capcom have a press conference tomorrow
[02:21] <Amir0x> i just thought
[02:21] <Amir0x> 'oh shit what did they announce that warrants this much attention'
[02:21] <DrForester> <EviLore> I'd really love to just ban nintendo from gaf <- april fools next year ***** out the word NIntendo :P
[02:21] <Tiduz> i know
[02:21] <Amir0x> i thought maybe it was something interesting to troll
[02:21] <Tiduz> id kill gaime for onimusha ps3
[02:21] <EGM92> Tiduz, I'd just kill gaime...
[02:21] <Tiduz> Change the word nintendo to sony
[02:21] <Jide> sorry that should have been a question
[02:21] <Tiduz> thatll piss em off
[02:21] <Jide> ?
[02:21] <avcables> haha
[02:22] <avcables> nintendo to sony
[02:22] <avcables> that would be awesome
[02:22] <Amir0x> my question is
[02:22] <Jide> what time is it at
[02:22] <Amir0x> is it third parties that are wrong about the state of Wii's market
[02:22] <FirewalkR> if tomorrow nintendo doesn't announce at least one hardcore game, i think you're entitled to ban the word, evilore :D
[02:22] <Tiduz> and change wii to ps3
[02:22] <Tiduz> haha
[02:22] <Amir0x> or is it nintendo fantards that are wrong about third parties being wrong about Wii's hardcore market?
[02:22] <Somnia> I love how the UFC commercial starts with Chuck getting knocked the fuck ou
[02:22] <Somnia> t
[02:22] <Tiduz> oh yeah
[02:22] <Tiduz> EA MMA
[02:22] <Tiduz> lolz
[02:22] <Amir0x> 'Cause even from THQ, they're all "Wii's market is fucking SCARY"
[02:22] <Amir0x> at this point I have to think there's some truth here
[02:22] <itsgreen> they will announce a single title that captivates the hearts of the hardcore
[02:22] <itsgreen> and thats it
[02:22] <Amir0x> since this is like the fifteenth developer that said this.
[02:22] <Tiduz> Mario.
[02:22] * impirius has joined #GA
[02:23] <Tiduz> and zelda traintracks wii probably
[02:23] <EviLore> they'll announce some OMG MARIO or OMG ZELDA game, just one game, and nintendo fans will ascend to heaven and stay there for the 3 years it takes for it to come out
[02:23] <EGM92> is it possible to clone an HDD to another HDD within windows???
[02:23] <Tiduz> I like how wii has straight ds to wii ports
[02:23] <FirewalkR> what was that star wars trailer thing EA shown? i was playing live for speed and had just the conference sound in background lol
[02:23] <Tiduz> like that ff game
[02:23] <Tiduz> my god.
[02:23] <itsgreen> exactly
[02:23] * Kawasaki has quit IRC (Quit: )
[02:23] <Amir0x> Evilore if they announce Pikmin 3 i will ascend to heaven :(
[02:23] <impirius> it was Star Wars Cosplay Heroes
[02:23] <Tiduz> No More Heroes 2
[02:23] <DrForester> Amir0x> Evilore if they announce Pilotwings i will ascend to heaven 
[02:23] <itsgreen> EGM92 natively, I doubt it
[02:23] <EGM92> Pikmin 3 was already annonuced
[02:23] <Amir0x> if they reveal Pikmin 3
[02:23] <Tiduz> more trashcan action for Amir0x
[02:23] <Amir0x> i mean
[02:23] <itsgreen> but im sure there are programs that do that... 
[02:23] <Magus> Amir0x - YOU'LL DESCEND TO HELL MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
[02:23] <Somnia> 35 till ubisoft
[02:23] <FirewalkR> impirius nooooooooo
[02:23] <impirius> the xbox camera automatically grades your cosplay attempt... in 3D
[02:24] <impirius> you walk up to it and say "computer, scan cosplay"
[02:24] <EviLore> EA MMA is great news
[02:24] <Tiduz> when is activision somnia
[02:24] <Somnia> dunno
[02:24] <Tiduz> ubi is last from today?
[02:24] <EviLore> ufc undisputed needs competition
[02:24] <EGM92> itsgreen it took me 3 hours to clone my current partition and it failed at 99.9%
[02:24] <Tiduz> yeah i was surprised at EA MMA
[02:24] <FirewalkR> xbox camera scan only works with skateboards
[02:24] <DrForester> Natal was watching the E3 conference, Said all the Jedi cosplayers we're shit
[02:24] <itsgreen> Well fucking great MS announcing a 3d game, just as Japan banned rape games...
[02:24] <EGM92> I really dont' want to suffer through that.
[02:24] <Tiduz> ufc getting competition already
[02:24] <avcables> watch nintendo announce full body controls
[02:24] <Amir0x> it is funny though, but really Nintendo is the only developer I know of that has so many "pressure point" franchises
[02:24] <DrForester> Err, Ea conference
[02:24] <itsgreen> EGM92 is it your windows partition?
[02:24] <Tiduz> Wiimotionplusplus
[02:24] <Amir0x> that is, they can release nothing but shit but if they release that ONE GAME that you love from the franchise you adore, it makes all wrongs go away
[02:24] <avcables> you just attach these nodes
[02:24] * ghst has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.10/2009042316])
[02:24] <Amir0x> Nintendo can occasionally attain that quality
[02:24] <Magus> i'm not really sure what i'm expecting from nintendo beside motion plus
[02:24] <Amir0x> imo Super Mario Galaxy was that sort of game
[02:25] <Grecco> Man Icarus
[02:25] <Magus> all i want is from them to keep away ubisoft game
[02:25] <Grecco> made by Retro
[02:25] <EGM92> No, 2 seperate drives, cloning my netbooks 250gb hdd to a 500gb hdd on my desktop
[02:25] <impirius> i don't expect shit from nintendo at e3 anymore
[02:25] <Tiduz> I want a new mario
[02:25] <Amir0x> i really was a true Nintendo fanboy throughout my playtime of that game
[02:25] <Wurm> new super mario bros 2
[02:25] <Magus> and i guess it would be neat if they just showed a new IP or something
[02:25] <Tiduz> only game i truly went :D i like wii
[02:25] <Tiduz> is when playing mario
[02:25] <Amir0x> do you guys really think Nintendo is going to have nothing?
[02:25] <impirius> we're probably going to have a 45-minute long electroplankton 2 demo
[02:25] <Diablos> when is the next conf
[02:25] <Magus> well not nothing
[02:25] <Tiduz> I think mario announcement
[02:25] <Tiduz> or theyll get raped
[02:25] <Magus> just nothing special
[02:25] <itsgreen> hmmm no clue... should work...
[02:25] <Amir0x> i think this year they will come with something strong
[02:25] <Max\YouAreTheController> Amir0x: SUPER PAPER MARIO 2. I said it, It is truthery.
[02:25] <Grecco> eLektroplankton dj + Ravi drums
[02:25] <jake3hk> 30 MINUTES
[02:25] <Tiduz> i want to see god of war 3 action
[02:25] <Magus> i mean they are at the top,they don't need anything crazy
[02:25] <Amir0x> I am pretty sure Iwata already acknowledged last year was a clusterfuck
[02:25] <Tiduz> Amir0x
[02:25] <DrForester> Nitnendo has no middle ground tomorr will eithee be lol or the most epic thing in E3 history
[02:25] <Amir0x> and even sort of apologized for misinterpreting what they thought E3 was
[02:25] <Tiduz> their big thing will be the return of ravi drums
[02:26] <Amir0x> So I think... maybe they will have something decent
[02:26] <Grecco> Wii Rave
[02:26] <Grecco> featuring Ravi Drums
[02:26] <Tiduz> lol 2 wiimotes as lightsticks

[02:27] <Unison> garbage
[02:27] <Lo-Volt> Thank you kindly.
[02:27] <Grecco> I doubt Nintendos conference tomorow will be awful. The expecation is too low from 2008
[02:27] <impirius> lightning bolt action
[02:27] <Tiduz> is it just me
[02:27] <EGM92> wait... with natal, what happens when I'm masturbating in front on my tv? will it constantly keep changing media/ that would be fucking annoying.
[02:27] <Lo-Volt> So, I didn't see anything because I was at work. Anything amazing from Microsoft?
[02:27] <Tiduz> or did mgs not even get thsat much of an applause
[02:27] <Unison> never doubt nintendo's ability to under-deliver
[02:27] <Tiduz> at ffxiii the crowd went nuts
[02:27] * radioheadrule83 has quit IRC (Quit: )
[02:28] <Tiduz> You know what would be awesome ?
[02:28] <Lo-Volt> EGM getting to the point quickly, I see.
[02:28] <Wes_> "The game is good, the graphics are very good... we look great," added Ringo.
[02:28] <EGM92> everyone wants MGS4
[02:28] <Tiduz> if nintendo showed wii music 2
[02:28] <Unison> lol
[02:28] <minty> prob cause they don't care much for gayden
[02:28] <Amir0x> i mean, really out of all the developers Nintendo really has the most limitless possibilities to "surprise" us
[02:28] <Amir0x> since pretty much securing any mainline franchise would shock GAF at this point
[02:28] <Magus> http://i40.tinypic.com/2rpz9mv.gif
[02:28] <Magus> this one wins
[02:28] <Tiduz> on one side i hope ms do motion shit too
[02:28] <Max\YouAreTheController> yup
[02:28] <Max\YouAreTheController> Dragon Quest X
[02:28] <Tiduz> so the wii has competition from 2 sides
[02:28] <Tiduz> and no hd

[02:29] <Amir0x> i...my mind isn't capable of comprehending that Evilore

[02:30] <Amir0x> lol
[02:30] <Amir0x> PSP GO
[02:30] <avcables> 300 times more powerful
[02:30] <Amir0x> christ @ that design

[02:32] <Magus> and this isn't?
[02:32] <Lo-Volt> How was Natal received on stage?
[02:32] <EviLore> ami: basically, cryengine 2 is a PC engine.  used for crysis and crysis warhead.  cryengine 3 is a multiplatform engine scalable to current gen console hardware and next gen console hardware, and it's being used for crysis 2, allowing it to be on everything
[02:32] <Amir0x> Looks like some new Mario game will be at E3 for Nintendo
[02:32] <Unison> The problem with the Sony EyeToy and its ilk was that they were lame.

[02:33] <Tiduz> you think it will be up later on?
[02:33] <jake3hk> dammit
[02:33] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> crysis 3?

[02:33] <jake3hk> back to morgan webb on g4
[02:33] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> they making 2 and 3 at the same time?
[02:33] <Unison> With Project Natal, instead of using a joystick, you steer by holding your hands up in the air like you're gripping a steering wheel. To hit the gas, you move your foot forward along the floor. To brake, you move it back. To trigger the turbo boost, you do a gear-shifting, fist-pumping movement with your right arm. Awesome.
[02:33] <Unison> ROFL
[02:33] <avcables> the third crysis game
[02:33] <Amir0x> Endless Ocean 2 also received a huge banner
[02:33] <Unison> fist pumping = turbo
[02:33] <Unison> in burnout
[02:33] <Lo-Volt> I am not doing those motions.
[02:33] <Amir0x> and so did Sin & PUnishment 2
[02:33] <Amir0x> So we know...
[02:33] <Lo-Volt> Not that I intend to buy a 360 anyway.
[02:33] <Amir0x> 1. Mario Game 2. Sin & Punishment 2 3. Endless Ocean 2
[02:33] <Amir0x> are gonna be at Nintendo's show
[02:33] <EviLore> crysis warhead isn't crysis 2

[02:35] <impirius> uhhhhh
[02:35] <Grecco> People love Little Milo

[02:35] <Lelielle> time magazine is pretty craptastic 
[02:35] <itsgreen> EGM92: Splinter Cell, HALO ODST appeared to look good according to Ngai
[02:35] <Tiduz> that old youtube dude
[02:35] <Tiduz> the creepy guy
[02:35] <Tiduz> is gonna buy mil
[02:35] <Tiduz> milo* for sure
[02:35] <EGM92> conviction demo was cool
[02:35] <Amir0x> Apparently the Mario game was definitely in the Wii section too sooooo
[02:35] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> I almost hate to ask, but as anything of note taken place today?
[02:35] <Amir0x> I doubt it's another Mario Party
[02:35] <EGM92> halo odst was yawn inspiring.
[02:35] <Tiduz> Mario tennis
[02:35] <EGM92> not interested in it
[02:35] * ZombieSupaStar has joined #GA
[02:35] <impirius> Mario is Missing Wii

[02:36] <Unison> Far Cry 2 = 2.9M copies
[02:36] <Amir0x> i hope Nintendo realizes how amazing that game was and puts the effort to directly expand on its greatness with five trillion more levels 
[02:36] <itsgreen> what are speculating about?
[02:36] <Lo-Volt> I think Microsoft has a good idea in more integration.
[02:36] <Wurm> Mario Galaxy New Play Control
[02:36] <Unison> Prince of Persia = 2.3M copies
[02:36] <Wes_> "Florida Epidemic: Teachers Sleeping with Students"
[02:36] <impirius> god, mario galaxy... i almost can't believe that game even exists. it's too good
[02:36] <Lo-Volt> 360 to work with last.fm and Facebook.
[02:36] <Tiduz> nintendo should just only release mario games on wii
[02:36] <minty> not bad

[02:39] <EGM92> Ninja Gaiden Solid.
[02:39] <duckroll> jett: i never thought it would see the day Kojima announces of rebranded Castlevania game by a western dev
[02:39] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> too bad 360 is dvd based though, so it'll obviously suck
[02:39] <jett\amir0x-am-cry> shinobi: whatchu talking about willis, MGS4 is still ps3 exclusive
[02:39] <duckroll> its one of the weirdest things ever
[02:39] <BlueTsunami> It'll probably be MGS Devil May Cry
[02:39] <BlueTsunami> :(
[02:39] <itsgreen> Is there any podcast that matters out yet, talking about MS's conference?
[02:39] <ZombieSupaStar> is it like metal gear 4 substance?
[02:39] <ZombieSupaStar> or something?
[02:39] <duckroll> ZombieSupaStar: no
[02:39] * PezRadar has quit IRC (Quit: )
[02:39] <duckroll> its not MGS4
[02:39] <duckroll> its a new game

[02:39] <Tiduz> MGS peins rising
[02:39] <Acosta> it≈õ zoe
[02:39] <Unison> lol
[02:39] <Acosta> disguised as metal gear
[02:39] <BlueTsunami> MGS Rising: LOTS O' DICK GRABBIN'
[02:39] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> no one would buy mgs4 360 at this point
[02:39] <impirius> lightning bolt action rifle butt ugly duckling
[02:40] <EGM92> it's a Mix of Shinobi PS2 and Ninja Gaiden
[02:40] <Acosta> because it was the only way to make an action game
[02:40] <Unison> they were shwoing a prototype commercial... and i thought it was infamous
[02:40] <EGM92> Raiden has to keep charging his suit
[02:40] <Unison> and i've played infamous
[02:40] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> if your game isn't out within 6 months of the original release, it won't sell shit
[02:40] <Unison> LOL
[02:40] <EGM92> just like Shinobi had to keep eating souls.
[02:40] <EGM92> Just you watch.
[02:40] <impirius> they can make MGS4 for 360 but all the cutscenes will be 56k realvideo

[02:40] <ZombieSupaStar> its because you like bret hart
[02:40] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> BRET!!
[02:40] <Jide> nah the konami engineers just thought fuck porting mgs4 to 360

[02:40] <Jide> lets just do a new game
[02:40] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> yeah
[02:40] <EGM92> Is this the metal gear that one on that konami website/

[02:41] <impirius> hahahaha
[02:41] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> hehe
[02:41] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> maybe they'll use C64's SID
[02:41] <EGM92> being back that NES feeling.
[02:41] <impirius> audio will be via an emulated TI-99/4A speech synthesizer
[02:41] <ZombieSupaStar> is turtlerock doing it?

[02:42] <Y2Kev> omg
[02:42] <Shuri> i honestly didnt feel anything special about the so called ai director in l4d
[02:42] <Lo-Volt> All I can think of is that Beyonce song when I think of Halo. :/
[02:42] <Amir0x> and Pikmin 3
[02:42] <ZombieSupaStar> you just dont know it
[02:43] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> hardly matters, it'll still sell 3 million copies
[02:43] <Y2Kev> kojima is making a castlevania game?
[02:43] <duckroll> i think randomizing map elements is a HUGE deal
[02:43] <duckroll> Y2Kev: yes
[02:43] <Y2Kev> huahauhauah
[02:43] <Y2Kev> IGA AM CRY
[02:43] <bluemaxwork> no way

[02:43] <Ruroni>  http://g4tv.com/e32009/pressconference/ubisoft/13/
[02:43] <Unison> iga lost the right when he made the Castlevania 3d fighter
[02:43] <Unison> haha
[02:43] <ZombieSupaStar> natural selection 2 versus mode is to virtua fighter, as l4d is to tekken, and i LIKE l4d and tekken!
[02:43] <Ruroni>  http://g4tv.com/e32009/pressconference/ubisoft/13/
[02:43] <Ruroni>  http://g4tv.com/e32009/pressconference/ubisoft/13/
[02:43] <duckroll> Amir0x: there are parts of the maps which can be flagged to have different elements
[02:43] <jake3hk> JADE
[02:43] <jake3hk> JADE
[02:43] <Ruroni> er
[02:43] <Ruroni> my bad
[02:43] <duckroll> like they gave an example of a graveyard
[02:43] <Ruroni> didn't mean to mega paste
[02:43] <Ruroni> lol
[02:43] <duckroll> and by the time you get there
[02:43] <impirius> for example, a graveyard might have graves arranged differently to present an easier path through
[02:43] <DrForester> ANSWER THE POLL MY SWAHILLI COACH
[02:43] <Shuri> its live?
[02:43] <duckroll> if you're doing really well
[02:43] <impirius> yeah.. sorry
[02:43] <duckroll> the director can make the graves more complex
[02:43] <duckroll> and maze-like
[02:43] <duckroll> if you're doing shitty
[02:44] <duckroll> the graveyard layout will be simplier
[02:44] <duckroll> etc
[02:44] <Shuri> what feed will be the official #ga feed? the justin tv one?
[02:44] <Lo-Volt> Shame about the Air France Airbus. Good thing that happened after I landed. :/
[02:44] <mrsolo> http://www.gametrailers.com/video/e3-09-star-wars/49937?type=mov <- best trailer in e3?
[02:44] <Somnia> it can also change the weather to make it hard for you
[02:44] <impirius> i trust that L4D2 will be awesome, but it just feels too soon :(
[02:44] <Amir0x> <duckroll> the director can make the graves more complex
[02:44] <Amir0x> <duckroll> and maze-like
[02:44] <Amir0x> <duckroll> if you're doing shitty
[02:44] <Amir0x> <duckroll> the graveyard layout will be simplier
[02:44] <Amir0x> <duckroll> etc
[02:44] <duckroll> lemme get the IGN article
[02:44] <Amir0x> er
[02:44] <duckroll> its quite good
[02:44] <Amir0x> fuck sorry
[02:44] <DuckRacer> yeah i hope the director is more dynamic this time.
[02:44] <Amir0x> wow that sounds crazy
[02:44] <Lo-Volt> Shame, AF is a great carrier otherwise.
[02:44] <DrForester> Shuri shoudl be Justin TV's been runing like a champ fo rme
[02:44] <ZombieSupaStar> well im guessing l4d2 is pushed by console sales
[02:44] <Ruroni> think it can change the time of day too
[02:44] <DuckRacer> after a few playthroughs on a map i didn't really fear it
[02:44] <Y2Kev> g4 is using ubi?
[02:44] <Max\YouAreTheController> http://e3.gamespot.com/press-conference/ubisoft-e3/
[02:44] <Max\YouAreTheController> http://e3.gamespot.com/press-conference/ubisoft-e3/
[02:44] <Amir0x> i wonder if it'll be as predictible as L4D1's "randomized" elements
[02:44] <Y2Kev> er
[02:44] <Wes_> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=16105274&postcount=10499
[02:44] <Ruroni> not certain though
[02:44] <ZombieSupaStar> who care about l4d mods now really imo
[02:44] <Y2Kev> is using justin.tv?
[02:44] <Ruroni> Max, good link.
[02:44] <duckroll> Amir0x: http://pc.ign.com/articles/988/988161p1.html
[02:44] <bluemaxwork> apparenlty yes kev
[02:44] <duckroll> you can see videos there too
[02:44] <Amir0x> By the end of the second week, I memorized every single random element of L4D and pretty much predicted how things would go down
[02:44] <duckroll> oh and now there are limited powerups
[02:45] <duckroll> for bullets
[02:45] <stump> oh apparently MS released an XBLA trailer roll
[02:45] <duckroll> like, you can pick up flame bullets
[02:45] <ZombieSupaStar> amirox did you like versus?
[02:45] <ZombieSupaStar> or just co op?
[02:45] <Amir0x> ah so that's what was going on in that video
[02:45] <duckroll> and until they run out, your bullets will set zombies on fire
[02:45] <Amir0x> ZombieSupaStar: I played approx 300 hours of versus
[02:45] <stump> - Splosion Man - Shadow Complex - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Re-Shelled - The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition - Marvel vs Capcom 2 - BattleField 1943 - Joy Ride - Trials HD
[02:45] <ZombieSupaStar> do you pc game at all?
[02:45] <jake3hk> 15 MINUTES
[02:45] <impirius> versus is so, so awesome in l4d
[02:45] <Amir0x> unfortunately not, my current PC sucks ass
[02:45] <Amir0x> or I would
[02:45] <ZombieSupaStar> if so put natural selection 2 on your list
[02:45] <ZombieSupaStar> ah....
[02:45] <Amir0x> i 360 it
[02:45] <Amir0x> 1000 achievements on it though
[02:45] <Amir0x> my only 360 game with all achievements
[02:45] <ZombieSupaStar> l4d versus mode is alot like ns was
[02:45] <ZombieSupaStar> aliens vs marines
[02:45] <Shuri> haha
[02:45] <Amir0x> and since i hate achievements, that's saying something
[02:45] <ZombieSupaStar> zombies vs humans
[02:45] <ZombieSupaStar> etc
[02:46] <Lo-Volt> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=16106791&postcount=103 Yikes.

[02:49] <Amir0x> it'd be like sex on a disc

[02:49] <ZombieSupaStar> shuri, or they just said fuckit, wait for l4d2 guys
[02:49] <duckroll> the first time Al meets Barry is in 5th Lab
[02:49] <Amir0x> but i wish you could be a normal infected as you waited for your turn as a special infected
[02:49] <duckroll> Barry plays a very different role in the manga
[02:49] <duckroll> you'll see later on
[02:49] <Amir0x> that's my lone seemingly unanswered wish
[02:49] <Jide> its natal Baby!
[02:49] <ZombieSupaStar> im guessing they are expanding the engine, so the sdk was on the back burner
[02:49] <osaka> >later on
[02:49] <osaka> awesome
[02:49] <osaka> thanks!
[02:49] <duckroll> np
[02:50] <duckroll> Amir0x: that would be really boring

[02:51] <Amir0x> if ever a Wiitard said to you
[02:51] <Amir0x> "what does next-gen power bring to GAMEPLAY?"
[02:51] <duckroll> like, if someone is still alive while im dead
[02:51] <Amir0x> You show them Red Faction
[02:51] <duckroll> might ask him to hold back
[02:51] <duckroll> and wait

[02:51] <Somnia> Tiger Woods 10 to be first 360 game to inclue Facebook features
[02:51] <Lo-Volt> E3 has been preempted by real news.
[02:51] <duckroll> so we can attack together, etc
[02:51] <Amir0x> and then punch them in the face.

[02:51] <Shuri> i want a new punisher game from volition

[02:52] <avcables> according to gspot
[02:52] <jake3hk> everything
[02:52] <duckroll> Firestorm: AC2 for me
[02:52] <Amir0x> everyone just wants to see if Red Steel 2 is as embarrasingly bad as the first
[02:52] <Magus> ubimeh
[02:52] <duckroll> i actually liked AC1
[02:52] <Amir0x> and if they show BG&E2
[02:52] <minty> pop2
[02:52] <Firestorm> Oh right
[02:52] <ZombieSupaStar> magus: yeah it was 1 and 2, guerilla is basically all out doors with buildings on terrian (a sandbox game) but ALL the buildings have their own physics and structure engine, and every thing blows up
[02:52] <Firestorm> BG&E
[02:52] <avcables> splinter cell looks moderately better after having watched the non-shitty res version of the gameplay
[02:52] <Firestorm> There we go

[03:54] <BlueTsunami> Thank you Pele!
[03:54] <Unison> he's trying to outlast cameron

[03:54] <Shuri> Pele is a class act to do this shit
[03:54] <Lo-Volt> OK, I had to turn it off.
[03:54] <Lo-Volt> Sorry.
[03:54] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> this happens every year though
[03:54] <Shuri> the host is totally panicked
[03:54] <impirius> he's making fun of a lady in the front row
[03:54] <DrForester> This guy = 100X better than cameron
[03:54] <impirius> mercilessly
[03:54] <Java702> obbligato
[03:54] <jett\bizarro-jesus> evilore: he's actually improvising, because ubisoft can't find the trailer for the game
[03:54] <bluemaxwork> pele is saving this from being really humiliating

[03:55] <Amir0x> GrayGhost: "What do you think, more interested in this over MW2?"
[03:55] <ZombieSupaStar> pele: damn the white devils, and fuck you all Interpreter: I love everyone!
[03:55] <duckroll> Pele isnt doing this for himself
[03:55] <duckroll> he's doing this because
[03:55] <jett\bizarro-jesus> Pele should kick Cameron in the face
[03:55] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> conferences are for three things: trailers you can probably download already, monotone speeches, or bragging/shit talking over a bunch of powerpoint presentations

[04:02] <impirius> oooh... conviction has a DOUBLE MEANING
[04:02] <DrForester> THE KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOB
[04:02] <impirius> i like it
[04:02] <itsgreen> Boom
[04:02] <Max\TheSamuraiRS2> SAET RAILERRELRL LOL ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
[04:02] <Amir0x> did you play Red Steel max?  Or was it so intertwined with your memories of first touching the phallic wiimote that you seriously don't remember how atrocious it was?
[04:02] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> spiderman 2 trailer music plz
[04:02] <Amir0x> i mean everything about Red Steel 1 was shit
[04:02] <Amir0x> everything
[04:02] <Acosta> yes ubi, nobody watched that trailer
[04:02] <Amir0x> controls, level design, gunplay, visuals
[04:02] <Amir0x> what did you like about Red Steel Max
[04:03] <Max\TheSamuraiRS2> amir0x: that is your opinion, i loved it, even despite its flaws
[04:03] <Amir0x> that it ran 
[04:03] <Shuri> average cg
[04:03] <Amir0x> that it actually didn't blow your wii up
[04:03] <itsgreen> Oh no he is dead at the piano
[04:03] <Amir0x> is that what you remember fondly
[04:03] <itsgreen> surprise
[04:03] <Max\TheSamuraiRS2> I loved it because it showed promise of a glorious sequel
[04:03] <Amir0x> it has to be one of the most ill-conceived FPS of all time
[04:03] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> amirox uses a kingdom hearts avatar, so consider the source
[04:03] <Schw0wsers> I enjoyed some of the levels in Red Steel
[04:03] <kassatsu> now they will demo the same area
[04:03] <MrPing1000> thats a pretty flimsy reason to love something
[04:03] <kassatsu> from the msft conf
[04:03] <Amir0x> uh my avatar is not from Kingdom Hearts.
[04:03] <MrPing1000> cause the sequel might be good
[04:03] <Firestorm> it's from mother 3
[04:03] <impirius> don't show the trailer, show the bathroom demo!!
[04:03] <DrForester> And here to gee us a 30 mintue explination of the Splinter Cell universe.... TOM CLANCY
[04:03] <itsgreen> oh no
[04:03] <itsgreen> not the same shit
[04:03] <Acosta> the same
[04:03] <GaimeGuy> amir0x
[04:03] <Rorschach_EAWins> just take the statement and insert mother 3
[04:03] <Rorschach_EAWins> still applies
[04:03] <MrPing1000> Get ready for QUICK TIME events, this game is shit
[04:03] <BJ> Way to score with the bases loaded, 0 out Yanks
[04:03] <itsgreen> fucking ubisoft
[04:04] <Acosta> comparing mother with kingdom hearts should be ban worthy
[04:04] <Rorschach_EAWins> I don't even know what the conversation is about
[04:04] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> well it sure looks fruity enough to be from kindom hearts
[04:04] <DrForester> Nintendo conference is going to star before this ends...
[04:04] <ghst> fucking cinematic trailers. I DONT PLAY CUTSCENES.
[04:04] <Max\TheSamuraiRS2> but I also loved Red Steel 1 because of the way I got to interact FIRST before any other game could show me
[04:04] <itsgreen> AGAIN
[04:04] * avcablesiphone has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[04:04] <Firestorm> same speech. who the hell would be at ubisoft's conference tha twasn't at microsoft's?

[04:04] <Shuri> exxy said ubisoft was editing stuff live
[04:04] <Shuri> before the conference
[04:04] <MrPing1000> We can play a game with the trailer, count how many times sam gets shot and count how many times he misses and count how many times he does all the hard stuff for you
[04:04] <Shuri> like the scripts
[04:04] <GaimeGuy> your mother can kiss my ass

[04:09] <Amir0x> <Max\TheSamuraiRS2> amir0x: capcom? capcom?
[04:09] <EviLore> the objectives being painted in the environment is so strange
[04:09] <Amir0x> Capcom fits, plus that's a handheld Zelda
[04:09] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> frankly I'm amazed they even have a game demo at the show
[04:09] <Y2Kev> this guy is totally faking!
[04:09] <Y2Kev> lol
[04:09] <impirius> who is carrying the ubisoft steam?
[04:10] <itsgreen> EviLore I like it...
[04:10] <MrPing1000> It's beyond autoaim
[04:10] <GaimeGuy> ME
[04:10] <Max\TheSamuraiRS2> why not give retro a console zelda that's spin off
[04:10] <itsgreen> It really keeps you in the game
[04:10] <DrForester> Cameron not showing anythign comes as no surprise to me now.  Who the hell would warn people abotu that crap with visuals
[04:10] <itsgreen> instead of a stupid cutscene
[04:10] <Shuri> did the sound just stop
[04:10] <GaimeGuy> AMIROX
[04:10] <impirius> wife kicked me off the tv because the french guy and cameron were so damn boring

[04:10] <jake3hk> FUCKING BAD ASS
[04:10] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> haha
[04:10] <Rorschach_EAWins> impirius: she did you a favor
[04:10] <jake3hk> FUCKING BAD ASS
[04:10] <MrPing1000> your wife would have liked pele's harry soccer
[04:10] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> again, everyone in here will be watching avatar in december
[04:10] <GaimeGuy> who are the "they"s who said you'd need to recalibrate wii motion plus every time you start a game
[04:10] <Unison> hahaha imp
[04:10] <GaimeGuy> please tell me it wasn't nintendo
[04:10] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> whether they want to or not
[04:10] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> and you can quote that
[04:11] <itsgreen> What was that self mastrubating game FF12 right?
[04:11] <EviLore> EMP grenade just to destroy lights
[04:11] <EviLore> luuuuuuuuuulz
[04:11] <Shuri> that wii motion plus calibration stuff is real?
[04:11] <kassatsu> GaimeGuy: you need to
[04:11] <Amir0x> Shuri: In Red Steel 2 at least
[04:11] <MrPing1000> Splinter Cell: Easymode
[04:11] <Y2Kev> i love ubisoft VA
[04:11] <Unison> they already confirmed that i thought
[04:11] <kassatsu> it takes like 2sec at most
[04:11] <Y2Kev> it's so bad
[04:11] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> batman's cooler, he used a batarang to destroy the lights
[04:11] <bluemaxwork> this game is a movie
[04:11] <Amir0x> 3 secs to calibrate everytime you turn the game on
[04:11] <Amir0x> fuck lame
[04:11] <Shuri> this is going on for too long
[04:11] <bluemaxwork> with occasional button presses
[04:11] <Firestorm> we're at 1:10

[04:56] <Y2Kev> Shuri: gaf is a bunch of whores you can market easily too
[04:56] <MrPing1000> Manos: Hand of Fate was better
[04:56] <Y2Kev> *to
[04:56] <Unison> i love AC1
[04:56] <Unison> haha
[04:56] <DrForester> OT needs to be reopened for Scullybundo meltdown
[04:56] <Grecco> I hated AC1 but am hyped for AC2
[04:56] <duckroll> me too
[04:56] <Shuri> i liked it a lot
[04:56] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> you're just pretending uni
[04:56] <duckroll> i love AC1
[04:56] <Shuri> until the third city
[04:56] <osaka> you know
[04:56] <Grecco> the whole Venice thing
[04:56] <Unison> i cant believe that conference
[04:56] <ghst> the thing to remember about this is cameron
[04:56] <duckroll> i know its flawed
[04:56] <osaka> all those shitty myspace games
[04:56] <Unison> haha no way shin
[04:56] <atomsk> i've seen Manos several times, i would NEVER watch the Ubi conference several times
[04:56] <duckroll> but i really like it
[04:56] <Unison> it is flawed
[04:56] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> sorta like how you're pretending to like infamous
[04:56] <osaka> made ass creed look decent
[04:56] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> and avatar
[04:56] <Unison> but i like it a lot
[04:56] <Java450> trendy restaurant music
[04:57] <Unison> hahahaha shin
[04:57] <duckroll> Unison: we are BROTHERS
[04:57] <Unison> >__>

[04:57] <duckroll> EviLore: how's Lost goinh?
[04:57] <duckroll> err going
[04:57] <osaka> i wish james cameron died
[04:57] <EviLore> telling us about how awful the avatar screenplay is
[04:57] <Shuri> <cameron> hay guys..about my tigers..
[04:57] <itsgreen> Who is with me rewatching it ?
[04:57] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> oh that's classy
[04:57] <EviLore> duckroll: busy with e3
[04:57] <ghst> he destroyed one of the most enigmatic and hyped films of all time in one insane fanfic lecture
[04:57] <duckroll> EviLore: he didnt say screenplay
[04:57] <duckroll> he said TREATMENT!
[04:57] <duckroll> lolz
[04:57] <Unison> cameron did himself no favors
[04:57] <Unison> hahaha
[04:57] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> are you fucking kidding
[04:57] <duckroll> maybe the movie still doesnt have a script
[04:57] <Shuri> would making a thread about avatar be ok?
[04:57] <osaka> duckroll: oh keep hoping
[04:57] <GaimeGuy> maybe this was all part of the plan
[04:57] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> lord of the rings would sound just as goofy in a spoken presentation
[04:57] <osaka> you just heard the script
[04:57] <GaimeGuy> and he lied
[04:57] <DrForester> Cameron expalined why there are no trailers...
[04:57] <osaka> he read it out from the monitor
[04:57] <GaimeGuy> :P
[04:57] <duckroll> EviLore: by E3, you mean, the WORST conference at E3 ever
[04:57] <duckroll> right? :)
[04:58] <duckroll> lolz
[04:58] <DrForester> Who wants ot see the furries
[04:58] <Unison> hahaha
[04:58] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> once the trailer drops, you'll all be dropping your draws and bending over for cameron
[04:58] <Unison> PSPGo leak made front page of y ahoo
[04:58] <duckroll> that was so bad
[04:58] <Unison> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJfZ6TjU1WQ
[04:58] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> you know it, I know it, so why pretend otherwise
[04:58] <GaimeGuy> best part of the conference was the rabbids torture minigame
[04:58] <Unison> no I Am Alive
[04:58] <Unison> no BG&E2
[04:58] <Unison> :|
[04:58] <DrForester> Avatar:  Hottest Furries Since Disney's RObin Hood (the animated one, not the charle sheen one)
[04:58] <Unison> yet Pele Potter
[04:59] * HitokageLaptop has joined #GA
[04:59] <stump> the rabbid torture thing has an eyeball inflation function and you can toss them around until they vomit... it's sociopathic how much you can torture them
[04:59] <DrForester> Rabbids Minigame was the only highlihgt
[04:59] <impirius> UPDATE: mamma mia is now playing "super trooper"
[04:59] <DrForester> that was hillarious
[04:59] <Unison> it's clear they won't show avatar until ComiCon
[04:59] <ghst> but guys. it wasn't all bad.
[04:59] <ghst> the graphics on ass creed 2 looked AWESOME
[04:59] <ghst> did you see them
[05:00] <Firestorm> yeah
[05:00] <Firestorm> good cg
[05:00] <darkh23> toy story graphics
[05:00] <Unison> haha
[05:00] <ghst> it was in game!
[05:00] <Somnia> time to play infamous and act like this ubi shit never happened
[05:00] <Shuri> Unison: in the furry hentai section?
[05:00] <ghst> you could tell 
[05:00] <EviLore> I can't wait to see what crysis 2 looks like on consoles
[05:00] <Unison> that's like that KOTORMMO Trailer
[05:00] <Unison> another scam

[05:01] <Shuri> man
[05:01] <Shuri> Cameron's endless rambling about avatar..
[05:01] <Shuri> he looked so lost..
[05:01] <MrPing1000> but this year I'm going to be one of those booth monkeys myself, showing MySims Agents over and over again to anyone who comes up to talk to me, for three days in a row, with full knowledge of exactly what is going to be going on in the journalists' heads as I try to hold their attention.
[05:01] <Max\TheSamuraiRS2> hjoly FUCK
[05:01] <MrPing1000> Geoff Green is dead inside
[05:01] <Max\TheSamuraiRS2> the red steel 2 walktrhough video
[05:01] <GaimeGuy> .....
[05:01] <Shuri> avatar's story was a mashup of the matrix, furries, star wars, the 5th element
[05:01] <Max\TheSamuraiRS2> is INSANE

[05:02] <Max\TheSamuraiRS2> the whole beginning with you being dragged by bike is REAL TIME
[05:02] <DrForester> Oh shit that was 2 hours long...
[05:02] <Somnia> "talkingorange Oh, Ryan informs me it's exclusive to the Sony event tomorrow. God, damnit. I couldve quit long, long ago"
[05:02] <Somnia> sounds like ass creed 2 gameplay is for sonys show afterall
[05:02] <impirius> avatar's story was fascinating to one person at the conference
[05:03] <ghst> i bet he just made that avatar shit up on the spot. like he does on every new day of shooting, everyone just turns up and humors him so they can get paid.
[05:03] <jett\bizarro-jesus> ubisoft has seriously angered me with this shit
[05:03] <EviLore> imagine if the ubisoft audience wasn't delusional
[05:03] <jake3hk> sony wins then
[05:03] <DrForester> imperiius scullybundo?
[05:03] <EviLore> and booed cameron off the stage
[05:03] <Unison> everyone assumed he'd show the movie or game
[05:03] <Unison> haha
[05:03] <EviLore> booed during every applause line
[05:03] <Unison> then again
[05:03] <Unison> they shoulda known
[05:03] <DrForester> Scullybundo when OT reopens is going to be epic
[05:03] <impirius> hahaha
[05:03] <Unison> because they didnt have 3d glasses
[05:03] <Unison> they won't show that movie w/o 3d glasses
[05:03] <EviLore> *nod*
[05:04] <ghst> ask anyone, even the most hyped avatar fanthing what the fuck the avatar plot is and they wont be able to tell you, despite cameron covering it all in immense detail
[05:04] <FirewalkR> they had time to distribute the glasses while cameron talked
[05:04] <Y2Kev> james cameron will personally mail every household in the US 4 pairs of specs
[05:04] <Unison> haha
[05:04] <jett\bizarro-jesus> you gotta give ubisoft props though
[05:05] <Java450> no i dont
[05:05] <jett\bizarro-jesus> they made a real god job at me hating the shit out of avatar
[05:05] <ghst> what, for not playing him off?
[05:05] <Y2Kev> keyboard cat was so needed

[05:09] <DrForester> Priz we wont know that till 2 months after Avatar hits theaters and is release don DVD so we can see the production notes
[05:09] <jett\bizarro-jesus> after listening to James Cameron's insane ramblings I'm pretty sure Avatar will bomb
[05:09] <jake3hk> im not even gonna pirate avatar
[05:09] <Lelielle> Basara: I came for the anime, I stayed for the pizza
[05:09] <Unison> the movie is mostly furry porn i am sure
[05:09] <EviLore> cameron is mad
[05:09] <duckroll> he is
[05:09] <duckroll> but so is Sculli
[05:09] <duckroll> lolz
[05:09] <Shuri> anyone got a picture of Cameron at the e3 conference
[05:09] <Shuri> like a snapshot
[05:10] <Lelielle> he had bowl cut hair

[05:10] <priz> Forester: I remember a long time ago on Aint it Cool, they talked about Avatar and how it was this film where the secret was one of the actors wasn't real, but the tech was SO OMG that you wouldn't know until the end of the film that one of them was actually CG
[05:10] <Unison> A car traveling on a motorway in Switzerland lost all four wheels simultaneously, coming to an immediate halt in the middle of the highway, police said on Saturday.
[05:10] <Unison> hahaha
[05:11] <Lelielle> thunk!
[05:11] <Shuri> duckroll: noooo :( but its ok
[05:11] <priz> Forester: and all I could think of is "with the way leaks are these days, good luck keeping THAT secret!"
[05:11] <Y2Kev> aww
[05:11] <Y2Kev> why did shuri's thread get locked
[05:11] <Y2Kev> its amazing thread
[05:11] <duckroll> Y2Kev: before its time
[05:11] <Shuri> just as i was changing the pic of Cameron to a pic of Doc Brown
[05:11] <Y2Kev> it was the ~ ~ that made it
[05:11] <duckroll> we can do it after E3 or something

[05:12] <DrForester> And Scullybundo needs the tag "James Cameron Is Senile"

[05:12] <dead> Avatar
[05:12] <dead> looks like a less colorful star wars episode 1
[05:12] <Shuri> http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b258/Ziyx/avatargame1.png
[05:12] <Shuri> that looks so Halo
[05:12] <Shuri> i think its the jeep
[05:12] <jett\bizarro-jesus> the artstyle in that game gives me no hope for the movie
[05:13] <Java450> avatar reminds me of a 1990s silicon graphics tech demo honestly
[05:13] <Unison> yeah ahha
[05:13] <Lelielle> ugh
[05:13] <Unison> well obviously the game won't look nearly as good as the movie
[05:13] <DrForester> Studio execs must be shitting themselves if they're watching E3 reaction blogs
[05:13] <Unison> so we have to assume this is just calculated to lower expectations
[05:13] <Y2Kev> http://www.vimeo.com/4952629
[05:13] <ghst> it reminds me of those pictures you get on graphics card boxes for games that dont exist
[05:13] <dead> wasnt the avatar planet supposed to be something never seen before
[05:13] <Y2Kev> BAM there it is
[05:13] <dead> I just see jungles

[05:14] <duckroll> -the- epic moment
[05:14] <DrForester> dead it was liek watching a person talk abotu the fanfic they just wrote..
[05:14] <duckroll> yes
[05:14] <DrForester> It was like Dax on stage...
[05:14] <DrForester> OH SHIT

[05:14] <duckroll> he talked about the treatment
[05:14] <Java450> i heard more coherent speeches in nursery homes
[05:14] <duckroll> the worldview

[05:22] <Tony_Parker> 1 vs 100!
[05:23] <GaimeGuy> so
[05:23] <GaimeGuy> other thoughts on natal
[05:24] <jj984jj> God the Ubisoft conference was so boring, reminds me of Sony's E3 2006 conference since they show and talked about games I'm interested in but just did the presentation all wrong
[05:24] <Shuri> is it true that ringo made fun of the animation in beatle game
[05:25] <Grecco> yes
[05:25] <Unison> yes
[05:25] <jj984jj> he did a little walk to mock it too lol
[05:25] <Grecco> 1 vs 100 is already sort of spazzing out
[05:27] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> did anyone make fun of ringo's drumming?
[05:27] * WasabiKing has joined #GA

[05:27] <darkh23> lol
[05:27] <WasabiKing> how bad
[05:27] <Unison> worst conference ever
[05:27] <WasabiKing> awesome
[05:27] <Shuri> dude
[05:27] <Tony_Parker> session is full wtf
[05:27] <WasabiKing> I avoided this place on purpose
[05:27] <darkh23> wasabi...the best part of the rabbids demo
[05:27] <Unison> haha truth
[05:27] <Shuri> Cameron ranted about his furry fanfiction for 20 minutes
[05:27] <darkh23> why do you want to avoid the lolz
[05:28] <Unison> cameron talked about avatar
[05:28] <darkh23> lolz
[05:28] <Unison> for 20 minutes
[05:28] <Shuri> avatar is about giant blue space tigers
[05:28] <Unison> and they didnt show anything
[05:28] <DrForester> cameron was tag fishing
[05:28] <Shuri> and the main guy falls in love with a giant blue space tiger princess
[05:28] <Unison> then they showed screens after
[05:28] <Grecco> lol the announcer is making fun of lebron james
[05:28] <Unison> looks like a bad halo clone
[05:28] <Unison> hahaha
[05:28] <Shuri> and holy crap
[05:28] <WasabiKing> <+Shuri> avatar is about giant blue space tigers - LOL
[05:28] <Shuri> i'm not joking
[05:28] <Unison> you think he's joking!
[05:28] <WasabiKing> who made that bet?
[05:28] <Grecco> Theres already 5k people playing 1 vs 100
[05:28] <Unison> it is a furry romance
[05:28] <WasabiKing> they might as well be fucking banned right now
[05:28] <Lo-Volt> Is V Australia part of the Virgin airlines network?
[05:28] <Shuri> mixed with matrix pod people stuff
[05:29] <jj984jj> showing a bunch of footage we've already seen was their biggest mistake
[05:29] <Lo-Volt> I've never heard of V Australia until last weekend.
[05:29] <Shuri> its like somebody randomly pasted together parts of erotic furry fanfiction, matrix  and halo fanfics
[05:29] <atomsk> lol kofi new champ
[05:29] <DrForester> SOMEONE NEEDS TO DO IT
[05:29] <DrForester> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=16114540&postcount=2846

[05:29] <bluemax> do what
[05:29] <WasabiKing> lol furries rejoicing
[05:30] <Shuri> btw
[05:30] <Shuri> the space tiger stuff sounds exactly like the Kilrathy race from Wing Commander
[05:30] <WasabiKing> somebody better sue
[05:30] <Shuri> but how they are "10 feet tall" (cameron's words) and blue
[05:30] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> and wing commander rocked!
[05:30] <Grecco> This 1 vs 100 thing reminds me of the EA Trivia thing
[05:30] <DrForester> Wasabi FUrries need something to pick them up after the heartbreaking loss to the Klingons a few years ago
[05:30] <DrForester> http://www.boingboing.net/2007/09/25/furries-vs-klingons.html

[06:00] <Tony_Parker> n/m :|
[06:01] <Amir0x> i only hate the GAFers who message me on my 360 trying to get avatars back, get unbanned, or get their account approved
[06:01] <priz> I need to call and yell at them A LOT
[06:01] <Shuri> amirox, delete them from gaf
[06:01] * HitokageLaptop has quit IRC (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)

[06:01] <priz> my 360 works great for almost 3 years
[06:01] <bluemax> time to test out ffiv the ay
[06:01] <bluemax> and finish making dinner
[06:01] <priz> then it freezes/locks up so they charge me $99 to fix it
[06:01] <dead> jesus
[06:01] <dead> that turtles in time remake

[06:02] <Amir0x> <Shuri> amirox, delete them from gaf
[06:02] <x3n05> fuck I hate EB Australia sometimes, just called me to let me know my copy of Red Faction will be ready to pickup...on Thursday, like I didn't fucking know that, I was all ready to go down after I answered the phone
[06:02] <Amir0x> That's generally what happens
[06:02] <ghst> 360s. they're pretty cheap. 
[06:02] <priz> I Was hoping that the rumors about a $99 360 arcade system at E3 were true
[06:02] <priz> so I could just replace the damned thing
[06:02] <GaimeGuy> no way
[06:02] <Amir0x> x3n05: Gamestop online has guaranteed street date delivery
[06:02] <ghst> cant really think of many other benefits
[06:02] <Amir0x> on TUESDAY
[06:02] <Amir0x> heheh
[06:02] <x3n05> bah lol
[06:03] <GaimeGuy> WHY IS DAHLIA HAWTHORNE IN THE MOUNTAINS
[06:03] <Amir0x> i just was playing Red Faction again.  I was fucking people up.  I didn't care for Fleetfoot much at first (who wants to run fast when they can JETPACK), but now I realize it's the ultimate ninja backpack
[06:03] <Grecco> Narc as Micheal Phelps favorite nes game
[06:03] <Grecco> i loled
[06:03] <Amir0x> With fleetfoot, you're all jetting around your opponent slamming hammers into skulls
[06:03] <Amir0x> Red Faction is one of the best next-gen games yet.
[06:03] <Tony_Parker> Randy Orton is getting killed
[06:04] <priz> My OH SHI- game of that generation? Ys Book 1 and 2
[06:04] <x3n05> oh man I can't wait to get online with it, my only fear is that being in Aus, and it having a similar match making system to Halo, that I will get connected to USA games more often than not, but I have faith :)
[06:04] <priz> I spent $400 on a PC Engine + CD 
[06:04] <GaimeGuy> believe
[06:04] <priz> because of that game
[06:05] <Amir0x> australia :( :(
[06:05] <priz> I also got Altered Beast on CD
[06:05] <Amir0x> I love having the lighting gun and then literally raining electricity from the sky as I land in with my jetpack
[06:05] <x3n05> yep, e.g. Gears2 is unplayable in this country, Epic's response, deal with it lol
[06:05] <Amir0x> and I love running fullspeed around a building as a collapse its supports
[06:05] <Amir0x> and I love setting sticky bombs underneath building outcrops as someone stands on it
[06:05] <Amir0x> thus collapsing it in on them
[06:06] <Amir0x> Red Faction is the most fun anything this year.
[06:06] <x3n05> bah stop teasing lol, 2 days I have to wait
[06:06] <Grecco> HEavy Rain as a question
[06:06] <Grecco> Love the Game trivia
[06:06] <Amir0x> I like Gears of War 2, but its matchmaking completely turned me off from the experience.
[06:06] <WasabiKing> wow I thought I was hateful, then I see a pro-lifer
[06:06] <Somnia> amir0x you gonna be playing red faction tomorrow night?

[06:09] <x3n05> haha, slacking off
[06:09] <Tony_Parker> awww we don't see how Orton leaves

[07:15] <Somnia> "stephentotilo Just played some left4dead 2. Used axe and incedniary ammo in new orleans parish mission, one of 5 campaigns"

[07:16] <nerbo> L4D2
[07:16] <nerbo> while I'd like to be excited
[07:16] <nerbo> I really just want t ask why I have to buy another game that I should have got the first time
[07:16] <nerbo> and so soon
[07:16] <Tre`> Valve is pulling an Actiblizz
[07:16] <jake3hk> dont have to buy anything
[07:16] <jake3hk> can buy it in a year for 19 bucks
[07:16] <jake3hk> same difference
[07:17] <Eric> It's not like sequels are unheard of
[07:17] <Tony_Parker> lol
[07:17] <nerbo> it's not that it's a sequel
[07:17] <Tre`> a sequel in a year
[07:17] <Tre`> from Valve
[07:17] <nerbo> it's that it's a sequel to a really short game
[07:17] <Tre`> to a game with not that much content
[07:17] <Tony_Parker> stopping the game to show commercials
[07:17] <Tre`> yeah
[07:17] <nerbo> really rapidly
[07:17] <Eric> Boo hoo, valve likes making money too
[07:17] <Tre`> Valve also likes making good games
[07:17] <Tre`> and not shitting out sequels
[07:17] <Tre`> or else we'd have Ep 3 by now
[07:17] <Eric> they also like spending half a decade doing so
[07:18] <Firestorm> l4d 2 was really shitty yes
[07:18] <pj> maybe they'll be cool about it and it will cost $30 on pc
[07:18] <Firestorm> worst announcement of the show
[07:18] <Somnia> "stephentotilo Just raced using forza 3 autobraking option. Very cool. Just needed to hold down the gas and stay on the green line"

[07:28] <Eric> what do you mean? your main friends list is there
[07:28] <Firestorm> does that twitter shit happen in the background?
[07:28] <Firestorm> like just gives you notifications as you play?

[07:29] <Firestorm> Have you ever signed onto MSN + XBL Friends list?
[07:29] <nerbo> I think they should offer the option
[07:29] <Firestorm> not good
[07:29] <Eric> there's a friends list and a linked friends list, something like that
[07:29] <Firestorm> NOT good
[07:29] <Firestorm> lags the SHIT out of your friends list
[07:29] <Firestorm> I have about 100 xbl friends + 250 msn contacts
[07:29] <Firestorm> if i sign into msn, i can't really switch to friends list
[07:29] <nerbo> I want to be able to easily msg someone on Facebook to get them into a game on Live
[07:29] <Firestorm> or it feels like my 360 crashed
[07:30] <Firestorm> well you better hope they fix their memory usage then
[07:30] <Eric> i'm not sure why you think you wouldn't be able to do that
[07:30] <ZombieSupaStar> forl
[07:30] <Firestorm> or you're going to cry when you try

[07:31] <ZombieSupaStar> their live and facebook linked
[07:31] <GarrettD> the song would be better without the singing
[07:31] <Eric> i don't know about the guide button, they haven't exactly shown where facebook, last fm and twitter will hide
[07:31] <Eric> probably though
[07:31] <ZombieSupaStar> .....are they stupid eric?
[07:31] <TToB> Fucking Gob on guitars there
[07:31] <nerbo> so if the live profile and facebook is linked on a friend's part, then I can get to them from that point?
[07:31] <ZombieSupaStar> did they have their real name in their bios also?
[07:31] <Eric> it showed a bunch of that chicks real life friends yeah
[07:32] <nerbo> did they say you can use Last FM while in a game?
[07:32] <Eric> wasn't mentioned
[07:32] <Eric> i'd guess probably not
[07:33] <nerbo> I guess I am still curious to the extent and manner in which these services will all integrate (or not)
[07:33] <nerbo> and how fluid it is (or isn't)
[07:33] <BlueTsunami> Wow the original cast of SVU is stil going strong?
[07:33] <BlueTsunami> Thats awesome
[07:33] <Eric> they showed a facebook friends list in NXE style
[07:33] <Eric> and had their gamertags below their names
[07:33] <nerbo> yeah, I saw that
[07:34] <Eric> do you want it the other way around, like their facebook names below their gamertag on the regular list?
[07:34] <nerbo> well... I think so anyway
[07:34] <nerbo> I'd like the option
[07:34] <nerbo> I guess what Idon't want is maintaining multiple, separate contact lists
[07:34] <Eric> i'd guess they'd probably be able to do that, or maybe you'd have to click the friend in your list to bring up that menu where you can invite them to a party and shit like that
[07:35] <Rorschach_EAWins> WasabiKing: first thing I'm doing in GAF franchise: NNAMDI ASOMUGHA EXTENSION
[07:35] <nerbo> I want them to integrate efficiently and cleanly
[07:35] <Rorschach_EAWins> 8 years of NNAMDI!
[07:35] <Eric> well we'll have to wait and see exactly how they reorganize the NXE
[07:35] <nerbo> or if they don't integrate easily, I want to be able to multi-task and switch back and forth at will, rapidly
[07:36] * Danj_sleep is now known as Danj

[07:36] <nerbo> I think Facebook needs to be utilized as a background service of sort to really make it worthwhile

[07:38] <ZombieSupaStar> i dont get why twitter is so popular
[07:38] <Eric> in the facebook demo and in the magic camera one
[07:38] <TToB> ZombieSupaStar: People are stupid.
[07:38] <ZombieSupaStar> its like an expired instant messenger
[07:39] <Eric> real life you'd be sitting there for like 40 seconds waiting for your facebook pictures to load
[07:39] <ZombieSupaStar> i can see why celeb hounds like it, they can stalk
[07:39] <Eric> or 10 seconds for it to respond to you telling it to play movie
[07:39] <ZombieSupaStar> i cant wait to see the 360 hacked because of facebook use
[07:40] <ZombieSupaStar> is it using a browser?
[07:40] <ZombieSupaStar> of any kind?
[07:40] <Eric> probably no more so than the rest of the dashboard
[07:40] <ZombieSupaStar> i mean can i put something on my facebook page with my pc that loads on your 360 interface?
[07:41] <ZombieSupaStar> or is it off in its own little thing?

[07:54] <Kabouter> I saw that trailer earlier though, but yes, it was boss.
[07:54] <duckroll> Kabouter: dude

[07:55] <jake3hk> they showin gameplay tomorrow kab
[07:55] <duckroll> you seriously missed a LEGENDARY conference
[07:55] <TEEEPO> who was that hosting
[07:55] <duckroll> it was just head scratching
[07:55] <duckroll> all the way
[07:55] <duckroll> CONFLUENCE
[07:55] <duckroll> lolz
[07:55] <Nikashi> BJ: We have most of them major networks in HD and a few specialty channels
[07:55] <Eric> Did Ubi mention BG&E2 at all?
[07:55] <Kabouter> Was it as good as that one Ubidays conference?
[07:55] <duckroll> nope
[07:55] <Eric> :(
[07:55] <duckroll> Kabouter: this one is the best
[07:55] <duckroll> it beats everything
[07:55] <duckroll> ever
[07:55] <Kabouter> Damn :(
[07:55] <duckroll> beause in the first 35 mins
[07:55] <duckroll> they never mentioned a single piece of game news
[07:55] <duckroll> or info
[07:55] <TEEEPO> oh god, it was the guy from the soup
[07:55] <duckroll> it was all ramblings
[07:56] <duckroll> Cameron was the KING
[07:56] <duckroll> he spent 15 mins talking about Avatar
[07:56] <duckroll> not the game
[07:56] <duckroll> not the movie
[07:56] <Kabouter> Seems to me, from reading them bullet points, they didn't mention anything!
[07:56] <duckroll> but his idea
[07:56] <duckroll> and his script
[07:56] <duckroll> and the worldview
[07:56] <Kabouter> lol
[07:56] <duckroll> and he was talking like everyone knew what Avatar was
[07:56] <duckroll> using terms
[07:56] <duckroll> and describing aliens
[07:56] <duckroll> totally psycho
[07:56] <Kabouter> hahahahaha
[07:56] <duckroll> it was weiiiiiiiiird
[07:56] <sprusk> it can never be as bad as the conference last year where capcom had the press conference for their lost planet movie instead of actual games
[07:56] <duckroll> no
[07:56] <duckroll> that wasnt bad at all
[07:56] <duckroll> it was it was a Lost Planet movie conference
[07:56] <sprusk> that was horrible
[07:56] <duckroll> :P

[07:57] <duckroll> Kabouter: Ubisoft had like 10 different presenters
[07:57] <duckroll> and 7 of them were incomprehensible
[07:57] <duckroll> oh
[07:57] <duckroll> and the best part
[07:57] <duckroll> is when Pele comes on
[07:58] <duckroll> and he DOESNT make a long retarded speech, and we're all "YAY!" and they go on to show the game
[07:58] <duckroll> ..........except there was a technical problem
[07:58] <duckroll> so the trailer didnt show up
[07:58] <duckroll> then Pele had to stall and make a speech about how much he loves children..... in porteguese
[07:58] <duckroll> while its translated
[07:58] <duckroll> epic
[07:58] <duckroll> and when they did show the game, it was just a CG trailer
[07:59] <GaimeGuy> duck
[07:59] <GaimeGuy> how did you like ep 9
[07:59] <BJ> Anne Hathaway time on Late Night woo

[08:00] <duckroll> GaimeGuy: it was good
[08:00] <GaimeGuy> winry kicking ass
[08:00] <GaimeGuy> :D
[08:01] <Kabouter> Only thing I got is that I watched the first episode of the new Fox series 'Mental'
[08:01] <Kabouter> You know House? This is attempting to be the same but with psychiatry.
[08:01] <Kabouter> Except House has a great and unique main character, and this so so doesn't
[08:02] <Kabouter> It's pretty awful TV

[08:06] <duckroll> really?
[08:06] <duckroll> why?
[08:06] <Kabouter> Nintendo gonna be so good, I expect revolutionary charts
[08:06] <GaimeGuy> do we have leaks yet
[08:06] <GaimeGuy> like, say, from the press site
[08:06] <duckroll> dunno
[08:06] <Firestorm> I thought conference threads are locked until conference
[08:06] <DrForester> nintendo doesn't leak
[08:06] <Kabouter> It's a shame that apparently, Nintendo does not have a shot at worst conference though :(
[08:06] <Firestorm> the way amirox was going about it
[08:06] <DrForester> I dont knwo why this is surprisng people
[08:07] <Firestorm> Nintendo has no chance at worst conference
[08:07] <duckroll> i'll let him handle it then
[08:07] <happy_phantom> anything decent come of the ubisoft conference?
[08:07] <Firestorm> They'd have to ROYALLY fuck it up
[08:07] <Firestorm> ROYALLY
[08:07] <duckroll> Firestorm: no one does
[08:07] <duckroll> Ubisoft = king
[08:07] <duckroll> its unbeatable
[08:07] <Firestorm> 2 hours.
[08:07] <duckroll> no one will beat it for the next decade
[08:07] <Kabouter> Maybe they'll have Pele for the entire duration of the conference
[08:07] <Eric> the non console maker ones don't count
[08:07] <Eric> you know going in those things are a waste of time
[08:07] <Firestorm> Did they not show games cuz their videos weren't working or something?
[08:07] <duckroll> Eric: not true
[08:07] <Firestorm> EA's wasn't that bad
[08:07] <duckroll> EA was fine
[08:07] <duckroll> very informative
[08:07] <Tony_Parker> BULLETIN -- YONHAP: NORTH KOREA LAUNCHES MEDIUM RANGE ROCKET
[08:07] <Eric> meh
[08:07] <duckroll> i mean, at worst, its supposed to be boring
[08:08] <duckroll> Ubisoft was unique
[08:08] <Kabouter> EA's is the best so far
[08:08] <duckroll> it didnt even MAKE SENSE
[08:08] <Firestorm> Saboteur was good
[08:08] <Kabouter> EA didn't waste much time
[08:08] <Firestorm> I can't remember some of it
[08:08] <duckroll> Saboteur looks solid
[08:08] <Kabouter> They just showed game after game after game
[08:08] <Eric> EA's looked boring to me, didn't watch it
[08:08] <Kabouter> Saboteur looks great if they can get the framerate up to normal levels
[08:08] <Eric> but looked like they didn't announce much new
[08:08] <duckroll> and Peter Moore's still a really good presenter
[08:08] <Eric> just MMA and maybe some kiddy games
[08:08] <Kabouter> Yeah, he is
[08:08] <jake3hk> ea didnt even show their 2 best games
[08:08] <jake3hk> gj
[08:09] <Kabouter> Which?
[08:09] <jake3hk> fifa and nhl
[08:09] <Eric> yeah i was following them on txt cause i was at work... and i was expecting them to show their ea partner games
[08:09] <duckroll> a conference doesnt have to have tons of announcements or great games to be a good one

[08:21] <Armitage> wow this is like ww2
[08:21] <Armitage> put into a ghetto
[08:21] <Pimpwerx> this is the first year i'd say i was officially out of gaming, so i had no idea why

[09:34] <Armitage> voice gets lost if i disconnect right?
[09:34] <Scarlet> i think so
[09:34] <Orbi> yeah
[09:35] <Orbi> they can set a mode so that it gives it to you when you identify with the server
[09:35] <Orbi> but they dont use that there
[09:35] <Orbi> man where is the bombcast :(
[09:35] <Orbi> its running late/on time
[09:35] <bluemax> fuck yo podcast
[09:36] <Scarlet> no endurance run this week :(
[09:36] <Scarlet> stupid e3
[09:36] <bluemax> endurance run?
[09:36] <bluemax> is that a podcast too?
[09:36] <Scarlet> its a video podcast i guess?
[09:36] <Scarlet> video with commentary
[09:36] <Scarlet> by some giant bomb guys
[09:36] <Scarlet> its like mystery science persona 4
[09:37] <bluemax> i see
[09:37] <Orbi> they like play through persona 4 and crack jokes and fail miserably at the game
[09:37] <Scarlet> im watching it cause i played p4 so much its fun to see their reactions to stuff
[09:37] <Scarlet> yeah
[09:37] <Scarlet> i posted some tips in their comments but they didnt see them :(
[09:37] <Scarlet> and now i forgot my pw
[09:37] <bluemax> i got to the first save point
[09:37] <bluemax> in p3
[09:37] <bluemax> go me!
[09:38] <Scarlet> its worse in p4
[09:38] <Scarlet> the intro is about 1:45 if you have turbo
[09:38] <bluemax> yikes
[09:38] <Scarlet> so about 2.5-3.5+ hrs normally
[09:38] <Scarlet> yeah it takes awhile to get going
[09:38] <bluemax> ive started a bunch of rpgs this year
[09:38] <Orbi> sigh
[09:38] <bluemax> without finishing any
[09:38] <Scarlet> kinda annoying on a replay!
[09:38] <Scarlet> but once you get out of it it isnt bad
[09:38] <bluemax> i got to disc 4 of lost odyssey
[09:38] <Orbi> i dont want to play persona 3 anymore
[09:39] <bluemax> and then stopped
[09:39] <bluemax> i got to the end dungeon of dq5
[09:39] <bluemax> and havent played it since getting 3/4 through
[09:39] <Scarlet> i juuuuuuuust got the bad ending on p3 before the ff5 thing
[09:39] <bluemax> and um
[09:39] <Orbi> i'm playing on PCSX2
[09:39] <Scarlet> got my lilim maxed though
[09:39] <bluemax> oh i played the new ffccds
[09:39] <bluemax> i need to get pcsx2 working
[09:39] <Orbi> and escape makes the game stop and i keep hitting it accidentally
[09:39] <Orbi> :<
[09:39] <bluemax> ha
[09:39] <Orbi> i lost about 5 hours of progress this weekend
[09:40] * ElyrionX has joined #GA
[09:40] <Scarlet> my comp isnt good enough or i didnt have good stuff for pcsx2
[09:40] <bluemax> i bought a new computer back in january
[09:40] <Scarlet> i played through p4 but it played really slow unless in dungeons and it crashed a lot unless in dungeons
[09:40] <bluemax> for the first time in years
[09:40] <bluemax> well
[09:40] <bluemax> put a new one together
[09:40] <Scarlet> heres my p3 main though! http://redscarlet.paragonsigma.com/fes085-maxlilim.png
[09:40] <Scarlet> yeaaaaa
[09:40] <bluemax> cause i got a bonus at work
[09:40] <bluemax> huzzah
[09:40] <Scarlet> i had a diff one earlier and a weaker lilim, once i hit lv43 i made her though
[09:41] <Scarlet> not gonna do alice like that this time, she will be like in p4
[09:41] <bluemax> i feel bad i havent even seen the actual gameplay
[09:41] <bluemax> of p3
[09:41] <bluemax> ha
[09:41] <Orbi> yeah p3 slows down a lot in battles
[09:41] <Scarlet> its very addictive for me
[09:41] <Scarlet> due to the dungeons
[09:41] <Scarlet> and 'hey lets just get some more cash'
[09:41] <Orbi> especially with your 4 party members and 3 or more enemies at once
[09:41] <Orbi> and certain bosses
[09:42] <Scarlet> looking at the pictures
[09:42] <Scarlet> its either part 13 or 14 of the endurance run of p4 when they are done with the 'intro'
[09:42] <Scarlet> (when you can start doing stuff on your own)
[09:43] <Scarlet> the non dungeon stuff is funnier
[09:43] <Scarlet> when theyre in dungeons they arent too good
[09:43] <Orbi> yeah
[09:43] <Orbi> but a lot of the start of the game is out of dungeons so its good
[09:44] <Scarlet> i tried to help them with some things they were having trouble with
[09:44] <Scarlet> like the dungeon camera
[09:44] <Scarlet> but they didnt see my post :(
[09:44] <duckroll> Scarlet: have you even completed an expert campaign on L4D
[09:45] <Scarlet> no idea how many i have

[09:45] <ElyrionX> wow OT won't be open until the end of E3?
[09:46] <Scarlet> you gonna give expert a whirl?
[09:46] <bluemax> this is normal

[09:51] <ElyrionX> uhhh

[09:51] <duckroll> Steam patch?
[09:51] <Scarlet> yeah
[09:51] <duckroll> or L4D patch
[09:51] <Scarlet> one or the other
[09:51] <duckroll> terrible
[09:51] <duckroll> i just got the ALL 4 DEAD achievement
[09:51] <Scarlet> ive HAD all the gold medals since about 2 days after survival mode came out
[09:51] <Scarlet> but one level is glitched
[09:51] <Scarlet> so im stuck at 15/16
[09:52] <Scarlet> and their 'fix' in the last? patch didnt fix it either
[09:52] <duckroll> how is it glitched?
[09:52] <duckroll> you just can't get it?
[09:52] <Scarlet> its blood harvest 2
[09:52] <Scarlet> the warehouse
[09:52] <Scarlet> it was a few days before a patch
[09:52] <Scarlet> where they fixed a safe spot
[09:52] <Scarlet> i played it, and the other people used the safe spot
[09:52] <Scarlet> i crashed my game
[09:52] <Scarlet> and it gave me the time but not the medal
[09:52] <duckroll> ugh
[09:53] * Armitage has quit IRC (Quit: )
[09:53] <Scarlet> and even when i beat the time, i dont get the medal at the 10:00 mark
[09:53] <Scarlet> so i got punished for not cheating :/
[09:53] <Scarlet> i think they quit at about 11:30
[09:53] <Scarlet> ive gotten 14-16 afterward
[09:53] <Scarlet> but i dont get the gold at 10
[09:53] <duckroll> survival turns into a bitch when there's more than 1 tank
[09:53] <duckroll> how do you handle that?
[09:53] <Scarlet> depends on the map i guess
[09:53] <Scarlet> and whats going on 
[09:54] <Scarlet> were you gonna play expert?
[09:54] <Scarlet> maybe pop would play
[09:54] <Scarlet> me and pop can get you through
[09:54] <Scarlet> havent played in about a month but we'll do ok
[09:54] <duckroll> rofl
[09:54] <duckroll> now?
[09:54] <Scarlet> ive beaten expert by myself
[09:54] <duckroll> dunno kinda tired

[09:55] <duckroll> 3pm
[09:55] <BudokaiMR2> i cant even imagine doing expert on the 360
[09:55] <BudokaiMR2> seems impossible
[09:55] <duckroll> BudokaiMR2: i can't imagine doing expert
[09:55] <duckroll> period
[09:55] <Scarlet> we beat expert without mics too!
[09:55] <duckroll> unless my friends STOP SHOOTING ME
[09:55] <ElyrionX> .....
[09:55] <ElyrionX> you beat expert without mics?
[09:55] <ElyrionX> WTF
[09:55] <duckroll> Scarlet: mics don't make a difference when friendly fire kills everyone!
[09:55] <Scarlet> well if you want to give it a try sometime duck, give me a hollar!
[09:55] <duckroll> k
[09:55] <Scarlet> i havent played since early may
[09:55] <Scarlet> so would be fun
[09:56] <Scarlet> i have 3 'command wheel' things to make the character say crap
[09:56] <Scarlet> so like if my persona 4 tank music plays, i can make char go TANK if i need to
[09:56] <duckroll> haha
[09:56] <Scarlet> the sunny town music your affection is my tank music, has been since like feb
[09:56] <Scarlet> its a nice contrast
[09:56] <duckroll> i actually only started playing 2 months plus ago
[09:56] <BudokaiMR2> wtf
[09:57] <Scarlet> plus still have tourettes tank going
[09:57] <duckroll> i bought the game much earlier
[09:57] <BudokaiMR2> at that nyco zoom lens
[09:57] <BudokaiMR2> omg
[09:57] <duckroll> but i started seriously playing recently
[09:57] <Scarlet> ah cool
[09:57] <Scarlet> yeah we played 1x
[09:57] <duckroll> so we're at Advanced now
[09:57] <Scarlet> then you never played
[09:57] <Scarlet> then you were on about a month ago
[09:57] <Scarlet> and i was like OMGDUCKLETSPLAY and you were like LOLZNO
[09:57] <duckroll> got a regular group going now
[09:57] <Scarlet> cool
[09:57] <Scarlet> yeah id play with ya
[09:57] <duckroll> so we decided to "try" expert after a Versus match
[09:57] <duckroll> and.......
[09:57] <duckroll> that didnt go well at all :)
[09:57] <Scarlet> well
[09:58] <Scarlet> when a horde comes, go along a wall and bunch together if you want to make it easy
[09:58] <Scarlet> im sure you do that though
[09:58] <Scarlet> tanks have..8000HP? on expert
[09:58] <duckroll> we usually do Versus on saturday 19:30 GMT or so, because that's when we can get more people outside of our regular 4 guy group, since its the weekend
[09:58] <Scarlet> so if you have a mol, that sometimes works out better, mol then run
[09:58] <duckroll> yeah
[09:58] <Scarlet> or depending on where you are, the tank can be dumb and easy to just shoot
[09:58] <duckroll> mol + run is the best tactic usually
[09:58] <Scarlet> pop and i did expert with just pistol one time
[09:59] <duckroll> in the gas station we had a tank that got stick before
[09:59] <Scarlet> and with just sniper rifles not that long ago
[09:59] <duckroll> it was stuck between trucks
[09:59] <duckroll> and it was on fire
[09:59] <duckroll> lol
[09:59] <Scarlet> on my 1 player expert
[09:59] <duckroll> it basically killed itself
[09:59] <Scarlet> the tank took 3 mins to appear
[09:59] <Scarlet> it was 'stuck' but didnt go away
[09:59] <Scarlet> the last tank that is
[09:59] <Scarlet> on the finale
[09:59] <Scarlet> like dododo
[09:59] <duckroll> hah
[09:59] <Scarlet> oh well i heard my song a lot then
[10:00] <duckroll> what do you think of L4D2?
[10:00] <Scarlet> well if youre in the mood just pm me here
[10:00] <duckroll> sure thing
[10:00] <Scarlet> i h avent opened steam in a while
[10:00] <bluemax> huh
[10:00] <Scarlet> it seems weird
[10:00] <bluemax> new super mario bros wii
[10:00] <bluemax> i didnt see that one coming
[10:00] <Scarlet> that its already been worked on and is coming out so soon
[10:00] <duckroll> well, on one hand i think its too early
[10:00] <duckroll> but, it sounds cool enough
[10:00] <Scarlet> yeah way early
[10:01] <duckroll> personally i think its a marketing issue
[10:01] <duckroll> it could be developed as an expansion in concept
[10:01] <Scarlet> and it sucks that any map updates we wouldve gotten are now going to be in 2
[10:01] <duckroll> but it would be harder to sell as an expansion
[10:01] <duckroll> especially on the 360
[10:01] <duckroll> so they just made it a "sequel"
[10:01] <Scarlet> i posted that id try the demo and probably get it during a steam weekend deal
[10:01] <duckroll> i got L4D during a steam weekend deal
[10:01] <Scarlet> i dont need it at release day
[10:01] <duckroll> so i might do the same, or i might just bite the bullet
[10:01] <duckroll> it depends on other people honestly
[10:02] <Scarlet> i mean im looking forward to new maps and stuff
[10:02] <Scarlet> but not for $50 or $60 or something
[10:02] <duckroll> like, if i know for certain there will be a group to regularly play with from release day, i'll get it
[10:02] <duckroll> otherwise, i can wait
[10:02] <duckroll> 60 is way too high
[10:02] <Scarlet> when going by like..counter strike and tf2, maps are made for free
[10:02] <duckroll> hopefully its 40 or 50
[10:02] <duckroll> well, the thing is that its not just new maps
[10:03] <duckroll> they're introducing quite a few new concepts
[10:03] <Scarlet> i have like 275hrs on l4d, so if i said i wasnt interested in some new stuff thatd be a pretty blatant lie
[10:03] <Scarlet> but not to be charged full price for new maps by valve
[10:03] <duckroll> what interests me is actually the new gameplay features
[10:03] <duckroll> more than the fact that there are new maps, new weapons, whatever
[10:03] <Scarlet> the new crescendos and stuff
[10:03] <duckroll> in L4D2, they have different types of finales and crescendos
[10:03] <duckroll> yeah
[10:03] <Scarlet> the tank looks like a redneck boomer now
[10:04] <duckroll> and the AI Director has control over certain types of randomization in levels now
[10:04] <Scarlet> the wandering witch thing sounds interesting
[10:04] <duckroll> like certain parts might have generated elements based on how well you're doing
[10:04] <Firestorm> seems like something for an expansion
[10:04] <Scarlet> ive hunted down witches for months on regular l4d
[10:04] <duckroll> the weather system should be interesting too
[10:04] <x3n05> game seems too soon, it feels like l4d just came out, I will most probably get it but I probably won't be finished with original by then lol
[10:04] <Scarlet> so something new with them will be nice
[10:04] <Scarlet> it DID just come out
[10:04] <duckroll> yeah
[10:04] <duckroll> it did
[10:04] <x3n05> when was it, nov
[10:04] <duckroll> it literally came out 7 months ago
[10:04] <Scarlet> yeah november
[10:05] <Orbi> the wandering witch seems interesting
[10:05] <ElyrionX> did they say how many maps?
[10:05] <duckroll> ElyrionX: 5 campaigns
[10:05] <Scarlet> they said 5 campaigns iirc
[10:05] <ElyrionX> hmmm
[10:05] <duckroll> and this time the 5 campaigns are linked
[10:05] <ElyrionX> how about survival mode?
[10:05] <duckroll> instead of each being a different "story"
[10:05] <duckroll> so you're traveling from location to location, there should be more of a narrative
[10:05] <Scarlet> which kinda sucks since who knows how many of them they would have maybe given out in a free release update for part 1
[10:05] <duckroll> supposedly
[10:05] <x3n05> well that will be kinda cool, is it still 4 player?
[10:05] <ElyrionX> well
[10:05] <duckroll> x3n05: yes
[10:05] <ElyrionX> when MS is involved that's usually the case isn't it?
[10:05] <Scarlet> theres a poster that shows the 4 new characters
[10:05] * priz has quit IRC (Quit: )
[10:06] <duckroll> MS isnt really involved though
[10:06] <ElyrionX> what about the weapons?
[10:06] <duckroll> this is Valve's decision
[10:06] <duckroll> weapons are new
[10:06] <ElyrionX> hmmm
[10:06] <Scarlet> i read theres some new weapons and new melee weapons
[10:06] <ElyrionX> larger variety?
[10:06] <duckroll> the big addition are melee weapons
[10:06] <ElyrionX> because the variety was kind of lacking in L4D
[10:06] <duckroll> fireaxe, frying pan, chainsaw
[10:06] <Scarlet> i guess instead of using your gun as a melee
[10:06] <x3n05> ahh cool, will go check it out, only caught a glimpse of it from the conference last night, stream kept pausing on me
[10:06] <Orbi> and some new tier 2 weapons
[10:06] <ElyrionX> meh how is melee weapons going to work
[10:06] <duckroll> i don't think the variety in L4D is lacking
[10:06] <ElyrionX> i mean
[10:06] <duckroll> all the types which are required exist
[10:06] <ElyrionX> they covered every possible type of guns
[10:06] <duckroll> its really simple
[10:06] <Orbi> There‚Äôs a new shotgun, a new semi-automatic, and a brand new sniper rifle. This last one feels dramatically out of place in a game where you can‚Äôt stand still, but it seems extremely likely that this will be the weapon that will be used most skilfully. Obviously powerful, it‚Äôs a very useful tool when you find yourself in one of the new ‚Äúgauntlet‚Äù moments.
[10:06] <duckroll> right
[10:07] <duckroll> L4D2 will cover the same types 
[10:07] <duckroll> but different guns
[10:07] <duckroll> and they'll handle differently
[10:07] <Scarlet> flamethrower is something people have wanted forever
[10:07] <duckroll> i think that's cool
[10:07] <ElyrionX> but seeing the same models and reloading animations and all that got kind of stale after a while
[10:07] <duckroll> ElyrionX: i guess
[10:07] <ElyrionX> yeah
[10:07] <Scarlet> supposedly you can crown a witch with a melee weapon (axe)
[10:07] <ElyrionX> the handling can be different
[10:07] <duckroll> i think of L4D more of an arcade style game
[10:07] <duckroll> like CS
[10:07] <duckroll> and its very fun and addictive that way
[10:07] <ElyrionX> like an M4 and AK47 would handle differently
[10:07] <duckroll> its very replayable
[10:07] <duckroll> also, there are bullet powerups in L4D2
[10:07] <Scarlet> elyr: just burst fire the ak!
[10:07] <ElyrionX> i don't know duckroll
[10:07] <duckroll> they showed fire bullets
[10:07] <ElyrionX> it gets frustrating when you keep dying
[10:07] <duckroll> limited rounds
[10:07] <ElyrionX> on expert that is
[10:08] <duckroll> when you shoot enemies they got on fire
[10:08] <Scarlet> maybe theyll have a bow/xbow or something and diff arrows
[10:08] <ElyrionX> scarlet: Well i've always preferred the M4!
[10:08] <duckroll> there will be new special zombies in L4D2 too
[10:08] <duckroll> and new normal zombies
[10:08] <duckroll> im not a shotgun person
[10:08] <Scarlet> like the re2/cv arrow things
[10:08] <duckroll> i use the machine guns
[10:08] <ElyrionX> i like the sniper
[10:08] <ElyrionX> but my teammates think it's useless
[10:08] <duckroll> i have problems getting up close and personal
[10:08] <duckroll> i keep fucking up
[10:08] <Scarlet> as long as 1 person has a shotgun/auto shotty for witch, that helps out
[10:08] <duckroll> i don't melee enough
[10:09] <duckroll> i end up shooting my teammates while protecting too
[10:09] <Scarlet> how many folks use them on your team duck?
[10:09] <duckroll> especially if they're close
[10:09] <bluemax> god
[10:09] <bluemax> nintendo fans suck
[10:09] <duckroll> shotgun? usually 1 or 2
[10:09] <Scarlet> k
[10:09] <duckroll> no one uses the rifle
[10:09] * Lelielle has quit IRC (Quit: )
[10:09] <duckroll> can't seem to find a good use for it
[10:09] <Scarlet> i like crowning the witch on expert while im black and white with the level 1 shotgun
[10:09] <duckroll> range is good, but rate of fire is slow and its hard to zoom/aim when you're being hoarded
[10:09] <Scarlet> hey m aybe youd lol at the 'lolroom' vid i did awhile back
[10:09] <Scarlet> was DA3 on expert
[10:09] <duckroll> don't think i've seen that
[10:09] <Scarlet> everyone kept killing the team on accident
[10:10] <Scarlet> goreomedy was so mad
[10:10] <Scarlet> er DA4
[10:10] <Scarlet> you know the room RIGHT past the fence
[10:10] <Scarlet> at the event (the van)
[10:10] <duckroll> yeah?
[10:10] <Scarlet> we went in there and got owned like 4x in a row by ourselves
[10:10] <duckroll> haha
[10:10] <Scarlet> usually by a badly thrown molotov
[10:10] <Scarlet> lemme grab
[10:10] <duckroll> speaking of a molotov
[10:10] <Scarlet> it maeks me laugh
[10:10] <duckroll> when we got to the first safe room in expert on NM
[10:10] <duckroll> i saw all the zombies outside it
[10:10] <duckroll> and i threw a mol
[10:11] <duckroll> then i ran into the safe room, and my team ran into the fire
[10:11] <duckroll> i closed the door lol
[10:11] <Scarlet> http://redscarlet.paragonsigma.com/lolroom.avi
[10:11] <duckroll> but they WOULDNT DIE
[10:11] <Scarlet> that was 3 plays in a row..was a good time
[10:11] <duckroll> in the end one survived and he was like "COME AND GET ME DUCK"
[10:11] <duckroll> so i came out
[10:11] <Scarlet> you can hear my tank music/sounds!
[10:11] <bluemax> i need to play l4d more
[10:11] <duckroll> and i got smoked
[10:11] <duckroll> luckily he shot the smoker
[10:11] <duckroll> and i revived him
[10:11] <Scarlet> lets play sometime blue!
[10:11] <duckroll> then.... he turned around and KILLED ME
[10:11] <duckroll> and ran into the safe room
[10:11] <Scarlet> i used to play alllllllll the time (i had only my comp at school)
[10:11] <duckroll> lololol
[10:12] <Scarlet> i totally killed nabs on vs
[10:12] <Scarlet> he was b&w on DT4
[10:12] <Scarlet> i saw him
[10:12] <Scarlet> like ok ill protect u!
[10:12] <Scarlet> then i heard a special
[10:12] <bluemax> ive played it twice scar
[10:12] <Scarlet> and turned to him and he startled me and i blew his head off
[10:12] <Scarlet> cool
[10:12] <bluemax> haha
[10:12] <Scarlet> ive played with first day people
[10:12] <duckroll> hahaha
[10:12] <Scarlet> i dont care what difficulty level it is
[10:12] <Scarlet> i have fun either way
[10:12] <duckroll> my main concern for L4D2 is splitting the userbase
[10:13] <ElyrionX> btw
[10:13] <duckroll> it seems a bit silly to me to do it so soon
[10:13] <x3n05> yeah it's great like that, very dynamic experience, depending on who you're playing with
[10:13] <Scarlet> grab that vid and laugh at how fast people die from fire on expert, bluemax
[10:13] <ElyrionX> when playing with mics, is it possible to route all voice chats to a seperate channel like on the 360?
[10:13] <Scarlet> http://redscarlet.paragonsigma.com/lolroom.avi
[10:13] <duckroll> ElyrionX: what do you mean?
[10:13] <ElyrionX> voice to headset and game sounds to speaker
[10:13] <x3n05> ElyrionX I don't believe so
[10:13] <duckroll> Scarlet: ROFL "I got that recorded"
[10:14] <Scarlet> yeah i was like 'im gonna record something'
[10:14] <duckroll> ElyrionX: don't think so
[10:14] <ElyrionX> x3n05: Wow. I didn't know that
[10:14] <x3n05> it's muxed into the one audio source on PC I believe
[10:14] <Scarlet> so it was like..well, i got THAT recorded
[10:14] <ElyrionX> i assumed it was doable since the 360 could do it
[10:14] <Scarlet> gores is the best
[10:14] <x3n05> yeah I wanted to do the same, but found out it couldn't be done, but I would LOVE to be corrected
[10:14] <Scarlet> he didnt even HIT the door
[10:15] <Scarlet> with his mol
[10:15] <duckroll> Scarlet: rofl this is hilarious
[10:15] <Scarlet> even if the door was open he would have hit the wall
[10:15] <Scarlet> i like recording l4d
[10:15] <duckroll> WTF is that music
[10:15] <duckroll> why is P4 music in L4D
[10:15] <Scarlet> my tank music
[10:15] <duckroll> lololol
[10:15] <Scarlet> its my tank music
[10:15] <duckroll> that's awful
[10:15] <Scarlet> its easy to hear the tank!
[10:15] <Scarlet> plus the happy song vs FUCK YOU from the tank
[10:16] <duckroll> its easy enough to hear the tank
[10:16] <Scarlet> im like oh hey i have pills
[10:16] <Scarlet> *use pills*incap
[10:17] <duckroll> i wonder what other types of special zombies they'll introduce
[10:17] <duckroll> the Charger sounds like a baby tank basically
[10:17] <duckroll> i'll love to see some completely original ideas
[10:17] <Nikashi> hay scarlet
[10:17] <Scarlet> hey
[10:18] <Nikashi> sup

[10:21] <Nikashi> Scarlet I promise we will play SF3 when I get back
[10:21] <x3n05> haha I think I saw that or something similar on youtube
[10:21] <Nikashi> Did you guys see the Macho Man mod for L4D?
[10:21] <Scarlet> i THINK i could get a SF3 board and play it
[10:21] <Scarlet> yeah id idnt like that
[10:22] <Scarlet> IF i can, id like to get a sf3 board
[10:22] <Scarlet> and hook it up
[10:22] <Nikashi> ahh yeah
[10:22] <x3n05> has Dawn of the Dead mall map come out yet?
[10:22] <Nikashi> but PC emulation is a good 2nd place
[10:22] <Scarlet> yeah but
[10:22] <Scarlet> having the arcade and stuff!
[10:22] <Scarlet> would be cool

[11:25] <KimiSleep> so
[11:25] <KimiSleep> what did I miss
[11:25] <sprusk> then why the fuck isnt it on the internet yet
[11:25] <KimiSleep> with my stupiud human needs
[11:25] <Scarlet> dunno
[11:25] * KimiSleep is now known as KimiNewt
[11:25] <Scarlet> it ended about 3 hrs ago i guess
[11:25] <x3n05> shadow complex on pc, now that's awesome :)
[11:26] <KimiNewt> is there any chance for any more valve- or firaxis- related announcements at this e3
[11:26] <KimiNewt> does 2k have a conference
[11:26] <x3n05> doubt it, Ep3 pics would be nice, but I am certainly not holding my breath
[11:27] <x3n05> did ms even mention GFW during the conference?
[11:28] <KimiNewt> oh dear
[11:28] <KimiNewt> my uni's strike is continuing
[11:28] <x3n05> what's the strike for and what uni
[11:28] <KimiNewt> strike for.. well I haven't really checked you know, probably something about money!
[11:28] <KimiNewt> Openu in Israel
[11:28] <x3n05> usually is
[11:29] <KimiNewt> Been on strike for a few months
[11:29] <x3n05> ... dman
[11:29] <KimiNewt> so we've been studying everything alone
[11:29] <x3n05> damn
[11:29] <KimiNewt> I was planning on doing a summer semester too and I dunno what the shit's gonna happen with that
[11:29] <x3n05> I feel for you man, though some of the academics I dealt with when I went to uni, well, it probably was better for us to study it ourselves
[11:30] <x3n05> I don't know much about Israel Uni's, there aren't other's you can go to?
[11:31] <KimiNewt> Yeah but I'm in highschool as well
[11:31] <KimiNewt> and this one accepted me
[11:32] <x3n05> ahh ok, so doing it as bridging course
[11:32] <Tre`> MGS Rising on PC too haha
[11:32] <KimiNewt> With my grades now I could probably get accepted to other universities
[11:32] <x3n05> like doing both school and uni at the same time
[11:32] <KimiNewt> bridging course?
[11:32] <KimiNewt> Yeah
[11:32] <x3n05> high achieving student obviously
[11:32] <Tre`> oh kotaku rumor
[11:32] <Tre`> nm
[11:32] <x3n05> haha
[11:32] <x3n05> hang on
[11:33] <KimiNewt> Yeah and I have even better grades now so I might get accepted to other unis. (After I'm done there isn't one that wont accept me, in Israel that is :/)
[11:33] <x3n05> I saw that somewhere else, MGS:R on PC,360,PS3 must be the same thing
[11:33] <KimiNewt> Though I'm studying less and less
[11:33] <duckroll> Tre`: its not a rumor
[11:33] <x3n05> ever thought about studying abroad?
[11:33] <KimiNewt> Yes
[11:34] <duckroll> MGS:R is PC/PS3/360, MGS:PW is PSP, Castlevania: LoS is PS3/360 Mercury Steam/KojimaProductions
[11:34] <KimiNewt> One of my sister did a semester abroad and liked the shit out of that, and my other sister moved to Ireland to study and she's there ever since
[11:34] <KimiNewt> Best decision she ever made she says
[11:34] <duckroll> its from gamepress
[11:34] <duckroll> they don't do rumors
[11:34] <duckroll> its basically the press lineup for Kojima Productions
[11:35] <Acosta> wait, wait, really?
[11:35] <x3n05> #Kimi yeah I hear that from a lot of people, I kind of wish I had done it at the time
[11:35] <Acosta> mgs pc?
[11:35] <KimiNewt> It's not really that I don't like the unis here, they're quite good. I just don't like my country very much
[11:35] <Tre`> shadow complex trailer is pretty hot too
[11:35] <Tre`> duckroll:  k
[11:35] <duckroll> yeah Shadow Complex looks hot
[11:35] <Acosta> indeed
[11:35] <duckroll> Tre`: we don't have the actual details for any of the games yet
[11:35] <duckroll> either Sony Conference today
[11:35] <Acosta> but holy shit, mgs pc
[11:35] <duckroll> or Konami conference tomorrow
[11:35] <Acosta> megaton!
[11:36] <Tre`> well
[11:36] <duckroll> Acosta: eh, what's the big deal?
[11:36] <Tre`> it's not the first MGS game on PC
[11:36] <duckroll> its a multiplatform game
[11:36] <x3n05> that's fair enough, well if you love summer most of the year, come to QLD in Aus :)
[11:36] <Tre`> plus everyone's multiplatform these daysd
[11:36] <duckroll> if you're making a 360 version
[11:36] <duckroll> might as well make a PC one
[11:36] <Acosta> yes but not every game has pc version
[11:36] <KimiNewt> Oh dear, Australia
[11:36] <x3n05> haha
[11:36] <x3n05> what
[11:36] <x3n05> :P
[11:36] <KimiNewt> Too far for me
[11:36] <KimiNewt> I'd rather go to Mars than Australia
[11:36] <x3n05> lol, awwww
[11:37] <Acosta> and I want to know what can kojima pro can do with a less limited machine
[11:37] <duckroll> erm
[11:37] <duckroll> i wouldnt expect much
[11:37] <duckroll> they're Japanese :P
[11:37] <Tre`> so true
[11:37] <duckroll> Japanese developers excel with limitations
[11:37] <KimiNewt> But it does seem cool
[11:37] <KimiNewt> Can you go out to deserted places
[11:37] <duckroll> they fail when limitations are removed
[11:37] <Acosta> heh, well, devil may cry 4 pc is the best version of the multi
[11:37] <Acosta> so I'm hopeful
[11:37] <KimiNewt> I mean in the sense that it isn't dangerous or anything
[11:37] <Tre`> it's like how japanese porn is so fucking bizarre
[11:37] <duckroll> yeah but it doesnt mean its a great looking game in general
[11:37] <duckroll> :P
[11:37] <Tre`> with mass censorship
[11:37] <duckroll> how hard is it to make DMC4 run well?
[11:37] <Tre`> exceling with limitations
[11:38] <duckroll> its not even a great looking game, period
[11:38] <duckroll> Tre`: lol that's a terrible analogy :)
[11:38] <duckroll> so dirty
[11:39] <x3n05> @kimi, yeah there are plenty of places like that, in my last house I used to get wallabies, tiger snakes, foxes and other weird creatures passing through my yard
[11:39] <Acosta> it has its moments, I personally like it, except for the mirror missions
[11:39] <KimiNewt> That could be nice, one thing that I dislike here that there are quite a few cool places and things to see
[11:39] <KimiNewt> But it's all "too dangerous"
[11:39] <x3n05> mind you it backed on to a nature reserve
[11:39] <Acosta> but playing with aa, 60 fps and so makes it better looking than the ps3 version
[11:40] <Acosta> I have both and I can really notice the difference
[11:40] <Acosta> but yes, it≈õ the best looking game at all
[11:40] <x3n05> haha yeah there is lots of dangerous shit here, but it's all just common sense, and I don't personally know 1 person that has been killed by a deadly creature
[11:40] <Acosta> *it√±s not*

[11:41] <KimiNewt> I don't mean deadly creatures x3n05
[11:41] <KimiNewt> Though sure we have Leopards and Hyenas

[11:45] <x3n05> leopards and hyena's beat foxes and wallabies any day on the animal side as well :)
[11:47] <KimiNewt> Well I'd say we win if those weren't on the brink of extinction and most of the other animals nearly extinct as well
[11:48] <KimiNewt> we do have some foxes and jackals though
[11:48] <KimiNewt> very little wolves
[11:49] <x3n05> that's cool, I love wildlife, I want to go on safari in africa before it becomes too late
[11:53] <KimiNewt> hmm

[12:03] <KimiNewt> nope
[12:04] <KimiNewt> actually, when I think about it, no one in my town has ever died of non-natural causes (excluding accidents)
[12:05] <KimiNewt> So whenever I go to the nearby forests or something I always get the line "Do you want to be the first?"
[12:07] <x3n05> well that's good, so it would have been a bit of a scare if you heard it lol
[12:08] <KimiNewt> I knew it was going to happen, we had one at school and htat's the reason I skipped
[12:08] <x3n05> ah ok
[12:09] <KimiNewt> I just didn't expect to wake up so late so I was suprised it didn't wake me or anything
[12:10] <x3n05> yeah, bit of a worry if it's not a drill
[12:10] <KimiNewt> meh
[12:11] <KimiNewt> if they hit us it's just because they missed a city
[12:11] <x3n05> this is palestine you're talking about I assume?
[12:12] <KimiNewt> when I say "they"?
[12:12] <x3n05> yeah
[12:12] <x3n05> or just generic they
[12:12] <x3n05> universal even
[12:12] <KimiNewt> I mean the imaginary enemy everyone seems to be so scared of
[12:12] <x3n05> oh that one, the one the media keeps warning us of
[12:13] <KimiNewt> yes
[12:13] <KimiNewt> those helpful watchdogs!
[12:13] <x3n05> haha yeah because they really care

[12:39] <Scarlet> lol
[12:40] <PopOnArrival> I don't believe you. :<
[12:40] <PopOnArrival> I haven't played L4D in 2 months
[12:40] <PopOnArrival> I think
[12:40] <PopOnArrival> not buying the shitty sequel too
[12:41] <PopOnArrival> unless it's like $5 for current L4D owners
[12:41] <Scarlet> its been about a month for me, so it could be fun, hes tried expert about 2x
[12:42] <Scarlet> would be kind of a fun way to play it again
[12:42] <Scarlet> he didnt like my p4 tank music :(
[12:43] <Scarlet> oh well sleep time

[13:03] <Kabouter> I agree sprusk, you wanna finish with a big finale
[13:03] <Kabouter> So they should start with the hour of charts
[13:03] <Kabouter> And finish with the one game
[13:04] * tsef has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[13:05] <Kabouter> Goddamn, watching CoD:MW2 in HD now, Infinity Ward is just completely phoning it in.
[13:05] <Orbi> you know i expect nintendo to disappoint so much im going to be disappointed if they don't disappoint now
[13:05] <Kabouter> Haha
[13:06] <Kabouter> There's one thing I'm really hoping to see
[13:06] <Kabouter> Reggie responding to Microsoft's digs at Nintendo yesterday
[13:06] <Kabouter> And responding to their ridiculous camera nonsense as well
[13:08] <Orbi> or they could just ignore them and go "well we're still making money even though its less than last time, here's some pie charts showing just that"
[13:09] <Kabouter> Nah, I figure Reggie is just the kind of guy who isn't just gonna let it rest
[13:09] <Orbi> probably
[13:09] <Orbi> well have to wait and see
[13:09] <Orbi> 6 hours now
[13:10] <Acosta> kab, they won't
[13:10] <Acosta> Nintendo will plainly ignore ms
[13:10] <Kabouter> :(
[13:11] <Acosta> only a guess
[13:11] <Kabouter> Wow that Halo 3: ODST trailer is just embarassing in HD
[13:11] <speedpop> Bungie weaving their magic once again
[13:11] <Acosta> it was embarassing in sd already
[13:11] <Orbi> also they've got to show SOMETHING to fill out those 1 and a half hours
[13:11] <Kabouter> It's worse in HD
[13:12] <Kabouter> What's amazing is the HUGE contrast between the backgrounds and the actual game
[13:12] <Kabouter> The backgrounds generally look really good
[13:12] <Orbi> they have wii fit+, that super mario bros game under the curtain, sin & punishment 2
[13:12] <Kabouter> The game itself is only marginally better looking than Halo 2
[13:12] <Orbi> and not much else
[13:12] <Orbi> also halo's skyboxes have always been really good
[13:12] <Kabouter> I know
[13:12] <Kabouter> Halo 3's were really good
[13:12] <Kabouter> I'm not even sure this looks any better than Halo 3
[13:13] <Kabouter> Oh wow, holy shit, greatest E3 ever
[13:13] <Kabouter> House of Tales announced their new game <3
[13:14] <Kabouter> release next year in English >:(

[13:22] <Orbi> the original sold truckloads
[13:22] <Orbi> it only makes sense ea would want valve to make a sequel
[13:23] <speedpop> I think it's due to Valve's style of support towards TF2
[13:23] <Orbi> and its not like they're developing a whole new game, it's just tweaks (some pretty big, i must admit) onto l4d's version of source and some new level and character designs

[13:46] <iAlone> anything megaton-worthy?
[13:46] <Orbi> boning in dragon age origins apparently
[13:46] <speedpop> let's just say that the highlight of the EA conference was a CG trailer to the Star Wars MMO
[13:47] <iAlone> a new sw mmo?!!
[13:48] <Orbi> uh
[13:48] <iAlone> $200 for natal...
[13:48] <Orbi> its the old republic
[13:49] <iAlone> OH NOOES
[13:49] <iAlone> next gen cv :(((
[13:50] <sprusk> i dont think itl be 200
[13:50] <sprusk> i bet itl be 150
[13:50] <sprusk> just going by more expensive webcams on the market
[13:51] <sprusk> 150 sounds about right, though i dunno how much the zcam costs
[13:51] <iAlone> webcams cost 150?
[13:51] * EGM92 has joined #GA
[13:51] <sprusk> there are 100 dollar webcams
[13:51] <iAlone> whars wiifit's price?
[13:51] <sprusk> 80
[13:51] <sprusk> with the game
[13:52] <iAlone> no mention of a release date... so early 2011 is the best case scenario
[13:54] <iAlone> so did red steel 2 look good?
[13:55] <sprusk> did you watch the video
[13:55] <EGM92> what time is the nintendo/sony conf in EST??
[13:55] <Kabouter> Natal doesn't just use the Vision camera?
[13:55] <sprusk> natal has like 3 cameras
[13:55] <Kabouter> Yeah....that's better than one infrared bar on your TV and a remote Microsoft....
[13:55] <iAlone> EGM92: 5 more hours
[13:56] <EGM92> for which?
[13:56] <Orbi> 12pm est for nintendo
[13:56] <iAlone> ninty
[13:56] <Orbi> then sony is 1 and a half hours later
[13:56] <Orbi> or 1 hour 45 mins
[13:56] <Kabouter> EST? No.
[13:56] <Orbi> or something
[13:56] <Orbi> idk
[13:56] <Kabouter> 12PM EST was an hour ago
[13:56] <iAlone> 5gmt ok
[13:57] <sprusk> how could 12pm be an hour ago?
[13:57] <Kabouter> Oh wait nvm
[13:57] * Kabouter stupid

[13:57] <Orbi> central europe time or whatever
[13:57] <KimiNewt> that halo thread is so retarded
[13:57] <KimiNewt> and I liked halo 3!
[13:58] <FirewalkR> what, metal gear rising on PC too?
[13:58] <iAlone> anyway 5 more hours
[13:58] <Kabouter> People are defending that trash KimiNewt?
[13:58] <Orbi> looks like it FirewalkR
[13:58] <iAlone> FirewalkR: yep
[13:58] <KimiNewt> Defending is an understatement kab
[13:58] <FirewalkR> awesome... one more pc game for me!
[13:58] <Kabouter> ...
[13:58] <Kabouter> Jesus fuck
[13:58] <Kabouter> I saw that shit in HD
[13:58] <Kabouter> And ODST is fucking HIDEOUS
[13:58] <iAlone> more demandung than crysis confirmed
[13:58] <EGM92> lol
[13:58] <EGM92> Kab it's still H3 engine
[13:58] <EGM92> that's sub hd
[13:58] <Kabouter> Yes, Halo 3 wasn't particularly a looker :X
[13:59] <iAlone> :o
[13:59] <iAlone> is rs2.... cell shaded?
[13:59] <sprusk> odst looked pretty garbage on all levels
[13:59] <KimiNewt> metal gear rising for xbox 360, ps3, PC, Wii, PSP, DS, GBA, GBC, Phantom, GB, WonderSwan, Linux, Dreamcast, PS2, Cellphones, NGage and Gamecube

[13:59] <Orbi> it did sprusk
[13:59] <KimiNewt> No mac version
[14:00] <iAlone> :(
[14:00] <Orbi> looked like a halo 3 expansion
[14:00] <Orbi> still running and gunning
[14:00] <KimiNewt> Haha, I like how someone in the thread is talking about halo as if it was the first game to allow you to pick up weapons and not be "constrained to a class"
[14:01] <Kabouter> Holy shit @ ODST thread KimiNewt
[14:01] <Orbi> well thats basically just saying halo was the first fps
[14:01] <KimiNewt> for them it is
[14:02] <KimiNewt> They're calling Halo 3 the most robust and complete package ever
[14:02] <iAlone> haha
[14:02] <KimiNewt> (Consoles)
[14:02] <KimiNewt> Even if that were true
[14:02] <Kabouter> And now we get the generation for whom CoD4 is the first FPS to have ever existed...
[14:02] <KimiNewt> It doesn't really matter if the actual game is dull and shit
[14:02] <Kabouter> Just gets worse and worse really
[14:02] <KimiNewt> gah scripted events
[14:02] <KimiNewt> I'll stick to TF2
[14:05] <Orbi> man there are hella agility orbs in this screenshot

[14:10] <Orbi> man milo sounds like a depressing game
[14:10] <Orbi> Peter Molyneux: You can buy stuff for Milo's world, like a bicycle or a trampoline. He'll come back from school one day and say, 'Oh, Alex' - Alex is this character at school who always does a bit better than Milo - 'Alex has got a new bike. When can we get a new bike?'
[14:10] <iAlone> creepy as fuck.
[14:10] <Orbi> WHAT
[14:10] <Orbi> Eurogamer: One of my colleagues did want me to ask why you made him a 12 year-old boy, and not a nubile 17 year-old lady acrobat?
[14:10] <Orbi> Peter Molyneux: If we were making a porn game, I probably would do that. He's not 12, he's about 10, and that's before he's hit puberty. Part of the amazing impact of this is he can remind you of your childhood.
[14:10] <iAlone> this is the sort of thing skynet is made of
[14:11] <Orbi> Eurogamer: My colleague pointed out that if it was a 17 year-old acrobat, instead of things like 'Have you done your homework?' you could say, 'Will you take your bra off?'
[14:11] <Orbi> Peter Molyneux: Yeah, you could do. You could make a great porn game with this stuff, that's absolutely for sure. But I'd love the idea that you've got this character who you are inspiring. It is such a wonderful feeling that to inspire anything, whether it's a dog or a person or a kid. When you see and feel that emotion, it's pretty emotional. 
[14:11] <iAlone> a dog? lol
[14:12] <Orbi> there's a dog in that milo game as well
[14:12] <KimiNewt> 17 year old?
[14:12] <Orbi> well, its europe
[14:13] <iAlone> legal takes out all the fun
[14:13] <Orbi> so the ages of consent are lower
[14:13] <KimiNewt> Peter Molyneux: So look, I know all of my previous games were a complete disappointment however I really think we're onto something here!
[14:13] <KimiNewt> Not everywhere
[14:13] <KimiNewt> it's 16 here but I think that in someplaces in europe it's 18
[14:13] <Orbi> ah k
[14:13] <Orbi> all i know is that in yemen the age of consent is 9, but you have to be married
[14:14] * tsef has quit IRC (Ping timeout)

[14:19] * dazzgc has joined #GA
[14:19] <KimiNewt> Had to be dumbed down for consoles; Old but still played, some old people play it
[14:19] <KimiNewt> and it's pretty awesome you must agree
[14:20] <KimiNewt> Tell you what
[14:20] <Kabouter> Certainly not a bad game no
[14:21] <Kabouter> i'm still not playing MP with you though
[14:21] <KimiNewt> goddamn you
[14:21] <Kabouter> Much as you're gonna try to get me to

[14:22] <Wes> The only game I've ever managed to play hotseat where it was a success was Sensible Soccer.
[14:22] <KimiNewt> I wonder how long is a Marathon game via Play By Email
[14:23] <Kabouter> You never played a Worms game hotseat Wes?
[14:23] <Kabouter> Worms Armageddon hotseat was amazing
[14:23] <Orbi> we need to get a worms armageddon gaf game going
[14:23] <Wes> Oh yeah forgot about worms

[14:24] <iAlone> so prepare 4 hours of megaton
[14:24] <Wes> I wont be here for Nintendos
[14:25] <Wes> So the Mario and Zelda megaton wil have to wait
[14:25] <Axord> Super Mario And Zelda Bros.
[14:25] <KimiNewt> It's in 3.5 hours right?
[14:25] <Wes> I thought 4.5

[14:26] <KimiNewt> well I'll be missing it anyway
[14:26] <Jide> ninty 4 hrs 30 mins
[14:26] <KimiNewt> If it gets delayed like usual for an hour and then goes on for two hours I'll catch the end

[14:35] <dazzgc> guys, can i get some quick opinions, whats worth finishing more, fallout 3 or mass effect, both pc versions
[14:36] * ElyrionX has joined #GA
[14:37] <Orbi> mass effect imo
[14:38] <Kabouter> Mass Effect imho as well
[14:38] <ElyrionX> what about mass effect?
[14:39] <dazzgc> thanks :D
[14:40] <Orbi> [21:34:45] <dazzgc> guys, can i get some quick opinions, whats worth finishing more, fallout 3 or mass effect, both pc versions
[14:40] <Orbi> man nintendo need to get ravi drums back this year
[14:40] <Orbi> i dont care what its fore
[14:40] <Orbi> they just do
[14:41] <ElyrionX> Uhhh Mass Effect has an excellent ending but Fallout 3 provides the better overall experience imo
[14:41] <ElyrionX> especially on the PC what with all the mods going around
[14:41] <dazzgc> im playing both unmodded
[14:42] <ElyrionX> I played both on the 360
[14:42] <ElyrionX> I'd still give the edge to FO3
[14:42] <dazzgc> installing ME already =D
[14:42] <ElyrionX> LOL
[14:42] <ElyrionX> depends on what you want really
[14:43] <ElyrionX> if you want a great story and good narrative, definitely ME
[14:43] <dazzgc> yep thats what i want
[14:43] <ElyrionX> but if you want good combat, loot whoring, and a huge believable world to explore, then FO3
[14:43] <dazzgc> although i did love oblivion even though the story was EH
[14:43] <dazzgc> but, i asked for quick ops and 2 said ME so we'l see how i go
[14:43] <dazzgc> i havent played either
[14:44] <ElyrionX> yep
[14:44] <ElyrionX> either way you can't go wrong
[14:44] <ElyrionX> they're both pretty good
[14:44] <ElyrionX> but don't bother with the sidequests in ME
[14:44] <ElyrionX> they're lame
[14:47] <Kabouter> Yeah, skip most sidequests

[15:12] <dazzgc> i dont mind the combat so far
[15:12] <dazzgc> its probably better on pc :P
[15:12] <ElyrionX> the combat's going to remain the same the whole game
[15:13] <Kabouter> I enjoyed the combat
[15:13] <ElyrionX> you did?
[15:13] <Kabouter> Yes
[15:13] <ElyrionX> What about it did you like?
[15:13] <Kabouter> Thought it far more entertaining than the snorefest in most RPG's
[15:13] <Kabouter> The fact that it was fast.
[15:13] <dazzgc> yeah its not bad so far
[15:14] <sprusk> i do have a name yeah
[15:14] <ElyrionX> Hmmm
[15:14] <sprusk> but it appears i have to mail something in
[15:15] <EviLore> 3 hours 45 minutes until gaf dies for no good reason
[15:15] <sprusk> says you!
[15:15] <ElyrionX> was the volume yesterday way larger than last year?
[15:16] <Jide> dazzgc it runs far better on pc
[15:16] <EviLore> consistently higher yah
[15:16] <EviLore> mirror's edge? yes, it's *amazing* on pc
[15:16] <Kabouter> Meh
[15:16] <ElyrionX> lol

[15:16] <Kabouter> You act like it's unusual
[15:17] <Jide> i thought dazz was talking about mass effect?
[15:17] <Kabouter> He was
[15:18] <Jide> ubi show anything interesting
[15:18] <Orbi> not really
[15:18] <Orbi> assassins creed 2 trailer
[15:18] <Orbi> no gameplay though
[15:18] <ElyrionX> Uhhh
[15:18] <ElyrionX> Splinter Cell?
[15:19] <Acosta> and no jade
[15:19] <Acosta> total fail
[15:19] <Orbi> that was just the same as the microsoft one wasn't it?
[15:19] <Orbi> but i guess they clarified on some of the stuff there
[15:19] <ElyrionX> wait
[15:19] <Kabouter> Ubi was the most boring conference in the history of conferences from what I hear of the people who saw it live
[15:19] <ElyrionX> i'm not sure what we're talking about now
[15:19] <Kabouter> Like duckroll
[15:19] <ElyrionX> oh
[15:19] <ElyrionX> ubi press con
[15:19] <Acosta> the ubi conference was atrocious
[15:19] <Acosta> too bad it wasn't one of the big three
[15:20] <Kabouter> Never underestimate Nintendo's ability to beat everyone Acosta
[15:20] <Kabouter> There's a chance yet
[15:20] <Acosta> or it would be remembered forever
[15:20] <dazzgc> i loved mirrors edge on pc
[15:20] <stump-work> there's not going to be BG&E2 stuff for a while. The BG&E team is, at least 50% of it, working on another game right now.
[15:20] <dazzgc> looks fantastic
[15:20] <Acosta> no, pleasem no "sony wand" 
[15:20] <Acosta> *cries*
[15:20] <Orbi> i havent seen it yet, apparently that james cameron guy was really bad
[15:21] <stump-work> I hope there's a sony wand so we can separate the actual people who don't like motion controls from the troll tards (Heavenly Sword threads are also a good way to do that)
[15:21] <Acosta> pc is the only sanctuary
[15:21] <Orbi> btw i didnt watch any trailers besides the microsoft ones
[15:21] <Kabouter> I bet they'll announce something huge for the Sony wand
[15:21] <Orbi> what other ones should i watch?
[15:22] <Orbi> the bioware ones and assassins creed 2?
[15:22] <Kabouter> God of War 3 shown > Jaffe says it's like a painting > Sony announces wand > Play with brushstrokes
[15:22] <Kabouter> BAM!
[15:22] <stump-work> Orbi: watch all the EA stuff except their casual junk
[15:22] <Orbi> so basically the bioware stuff :P
[15:22] <EviLore> http://dl.maximumpc.com/galleries/l4d2/l4d2_pcgamer_sm.png  awful

[15:24] <Kabouter> I think so

[15:35] <KimiNewt> what OSis that
[15:35] <KimiNewt> in the last pic
[15:35] <Magus> >:(
[15:35] <sprusk> with nintendo only being one hour, i doubt we will see much from there
[15:35] <sprusk> them
[15:36] <Magus> one hour?
[15:36] <Kabouter> The kind of OS that doesn't infringe on any copyrights KimiNewt?
[15:36] <sprusk> 60 minutes
[15:36] <stump-work> it's not like conference length determines anything
[15:36] <KimiNewt> heh
[15:36] <stump-work> MS ran long
[15:36] <stump-work> EA ran long
[15:36] <stump-work> Ubisoft...
[15:36] <sprusk> true
[15:36] <Magus> oh you mean the conference only last 1 hour? you sure?
[15:36] <itsgreen> hehe ubisoft
[15:36] <Kabouter> 60 minutes, damn
[15:36] <Acosta> nintendo can't ran long
[15:36] <Kabouter> They'll have to rush through the graphs
[15:36] <Magus> i tought it was 2 hours then instantly sony conference after
[15:36] <Acosta> there is sony conf after
[15:36] <Magus> yeah and sony conference is at 8 PM
[15:36] <stump-work> Acosta: sure they can, it's just journalists will have to decide between Nintendo or Sony
[15:36] <sprusk> last year there was only like 4 games right?
[15:36] <Acosta> and it≈õ coutesy letting enough time to arrive from one to another
[15:36] <Magus> so if nintendo conference start at 6 PM
[15:37] <Acosta> no, they never do that
[15:37] <Kabouter> Something like that sprusk
[15:37] <Acosta> at least I have never see it
[15:37] <KimiNewt> last year it was punch out and nothing else that mattered
[15:37] <Kabouter> But given the lack of success of 'real' games on Wii
[15:37] <Kabouter> There might be fewer this year
[15:37] <stump-work> sprusk: depends on what you consider a "game" to be.
[15:37] <Magus> Kabouter - maybe they announce some waggle device *giggle*
[15:37] <stump-work> They did a 3rd party montage, does that count as 1 or 3? They did GTA CW, but they didn't show the game.
[15:37] <Acosta> well, s&p2 is confirmed
[15:38] <Acosta> that means they will have more games than last conference
[15:38] <Kabouter> Standard & Poors 2?
[15:38] <Acosta> one at least
[15:38] * EviLore watches l4d2 footage
[15:38] <EviLore> uhhhh, this looks pretty lame
[15:38] <stump-work> Kabouter: Sin and Punishment 2. It's a sci-fi run-and-gun arcadey shooter by Treasure.
[15:38] <stump-work> Kabouter: the original was on N64.
[15:38] <Kabouter> I see
[15:38] <Kabouter> Never heard of it
[15:38] <EviLore> same game, in daylight and with some gimmick weapons
[15:39] <stump-work> It was JPN only, but a very popular import.
[15:39] <Acosta> the original never was released from Japan
[15:39] <Magus> it got a VC worldwide release tough
[15:39] <Acosta> it's pretty obscure but really awesome if you like those type of games
[15:39] <KimiNewt> I never palyed it and never it seemed interesting to me but it treasure
[15:39] <KimiNewt> it's
[15:39] <KimiNewt> wow that was a poor ass sentence
[15:39] <Magus> main guy is even an assist in brawl
[15:39] <Magus> i played it with an emulator a long time ago
[15:40] <Magus> but i never liked it that much
[15:40] * dazzgc has joined #GA
[15:40] <Magus> best n64 treasure game = mischief maker
[15:40] <KimiNewt> I couldn't even get through the boss run in gunstar heroes
[15:40] <KimiNewt> I think I got to the fifth or whatever
[15:40] <stump-work> The best is probably S&P, not playing in a shitty emulator you pirate, but Mischief Makers is also something special.
[15:41] <Magus> well i'm sorry for not having a japanese n64
[15:41] <Acosta> you can get it on wii
[15:41] <Acosta> I think
[15:41] <stump-work> you can play it on a US n64/
[15:41] <stump-work> Acosta: yes.
[15:41] <Magus> no US n64 either
[15:42] <stump-work> N64 has the same region protection as SNES.
[15:42] <stump-work> Take a knife, cut the plastic tabs out. Ta-da!
[15:42] <Magus> in fact i have no n64 whatever,a friend of mine lent to me his PAL n64 for a while
[15:42] <jman2050> what a surprise, Prine is eating up Natal like a puppy dog
[15:44] <Acosta> "made a connection with me"
[15:44] <Acosta> *sigh*
[15:44] <Magus> GA ADS are telling me "MARIO,FREE,LEGAL"
[15:44] <Magus> what's that supposed to mean?
[15:44] <Kabouter> Probably a Mario dating site
[15:45] <stump-work> Gay Chubby Dating.
[15:45] <Kabouter> Google ads show dating sites for everyone
[15:45] <Kabouter> So why not for Mario?
[15:45] <FirewalkR> ok.. how long till Nintendo? 3h15m?
[15:46] <stump-work> 12 eastern IIRC
[15:46] <Magus> yep

[15:46] <Magus> so 5 PM if you live in great britain
[15:46] <FirewalkR> great britain is at gmt+1 i think
[15:46] <stump-work> 1:30 PM if you're in the best time zone in the world.
[15:46] <FirewalkR> at least portugal is haha :)

[15:48] * minty has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[15:48] <Kabouter> (And five million seals)
[15:48] <FirewalkR> anyway, nintendo it's 3:13 from now i guess
[15:48] * darkh23 has joined #GA
[15:48] <ElyrionX> speaking of windows 7
[15:48] <ElyrionX> when is that coming out?
[15:48] <KimiNewt> everybody knows 15:48 is the best time
[15:48] <stump-work> Kabouter: 500k people and 6 million seals, bitch
[15:48] <KimiNewt> not quite the afternoon but not quite the morning I would say
[15:48] <Kabouter> Haha
[15:49] <KimiNewt> 500k people?
[15:49] <stump-work> yes, in the best time zone in the world.
[15:49] <Kabouter> Yes, they bothered to make an entire time zone for 500,000 people
[15:49] <Kabouter> It's like an exclusive club
[15:50] <KimiNewt> Is it like GMT+X:15 or somethinfg
[15:50] <stump-work> GMT -3:30
[15:50] <KimiNewt> lulz
[15:50] <stump-work> fuck nepal and iran, they're on quarter hour lolzones
[15:50] <KimiNewt> GMT+4:27
[15:51] <Orbi> i used to be gmt+12
[15:51] <Orbi> that was fun
[15:51] <Kabouter> Yeah, that's much worse than a half hour zone stump
[15:51] <stump-work> Orbi: new zealand?
[15:51] <Orbi> mhmm
[15:51] <Orbi> moved to aus though
[15:51] <Acosta> how long until nin conference?
[15:51] <dazzgc> where in aus?
[15:51] <stump-work> Orbi: that's like being promoted from a shit shoveler to a horse milker

[15:52] <KimiNewt> nail going blue
[15:52] <Kabouter> You know...many nations dumped their prisoners in the Americas too...
[15:52] <Kabouter> I know we did....
[15:52] <Orbi> i dont think i do
[15:53] <stump-work> not in newfoundland, what up
[15:53] <Kabouter> Well of course not
[15:53] <stump-work> we were always productive members of society!
[15:53] <Kabouter> That'd just be cruel
[15:53] <stump-work> har har
[15:53] <Orbi> i'm gonna get a couple of hours sleep before the ninty conference
[15:53] <KimiNewt> prisoners go to asteroid mining
[15:53] <Orbi> dont want that ruined
[15:53] <darkh23> this is going to be such an awesome day   "Sony Ready ?The Wand?"
[15:53] <darkh23> lolz all around

[15:54] <EviLore> pretty much
[15:54] <darkh23> yes evil....lets all toss our consoles out the window
[15:54] <darkh23> this gen is over
[15:54] <KimiNewt> crackdown 2 may not be bad
[15:54] <Kabouter> All consoles will have ridiculous motion sensing
[15:54] <Kabouter> So yes, all consoles are dead

[15:55] <jman2050> Natal sounds like a classic case of feature creep
[15:56] <KimiNewt> My PC is more powerful than a 360 by now and with PC I don't have to wait a year and a millenia for the game to get here
[15:56] <KimiNewt> feature creep?
[15:56] <KimiNewt> is that a tvtrope trope
[15:56] <dazzgc> there is really little reason to keep consoles these days
[15:57] <jman2050> I'm an advocate for simple implementations
[15:57] <jman2050> Natal sounds anything but
[15:57] <stump-work> the best part is that the 360 controller is the defacto gamepad for the PC.
[15:57] <dazzgc> if you dont like halo and a few other games 360 isnt worth having, i sold ps3 after i finished mgs4
[15:58] <EviLore> they should do a pc version of mgs4:s.  MGS4 is 1024x768, ugh.  the image quality is kinda awful during gameplay
[15:58] <dazzgc> that would be too awesome
[15:58] <jman2050> also feature creep probably isn't the right term for this
[15:58] <dazzgc> 1080p 60fps with hi rez textures if they redone them nomnomnomn
[15:58] <KimiNewt> oh shit I just realised I didn't work out at all this week
[15:58] <jman2050> but I think it conveys the right idea
[15:58] <Acosta> having a kojipro game in pc is exciting
[15:58] <Kagari> D: search disabled
[15:58] <Acosta> hope they push it a bit
[15:58] <EviLore> try google site search
[15:58] <Jide> jman milo is creepy as hell
[15:58] <jman2050> also the term "feature creep" has been around forever
[15:59] <stump-work> yes, it's a very common term.
[15:59] <KimiNewt> never heard it
[15:59] <jman2050> maybe it's cause you don't develop software :P
[16:00] * stump-work hi-5s jman2050
[16:00] <jman2050> the idea is that a product gets oversaturated with its functionality with the end result being that it becomes obtuse to the point of worsening the user experience

[16:01] <darkh23> need a meltdown post like that FF13 one
[16:01] <darkh23> yeah

[16:01] <Kagari> lol,at least it will be on PC
[16:02] <darkh23> "YOU HAVE DISHONRED JAPAN"
[16:02] <jman2050> The Wii works for most people because it's a braindead simple implementation

[16:24] <BudokaiMR2> you have to believe 
[16:24] <BudokaiMR2> then the images will become obvious
[16:25] <darkh23> I'm betting the wii mario game is a wiiware thing
[16:26] <stump-work> not a chance. nintendo has said they won't devalue their franchises by making them DD (seriously)
[16:26] <Unison_> yeah
[16:26] <Unison_> well not wiiware

[16:33] <darkh23> yeah the hair is bad
[16:33] <stump-work> EviLore, PC advice; what's the sweet spot, price-wise, for processors right now? I was thinking it'd make sense to go i7 for future proofing and stuff, but it looks like Core2Quad and Core2Duo are still the best performance:price ratio.
[16:33] <darkh23> conan style
[16:33] * darkh23 is now known as darkh_coffee
[16:33] <itsgreen> This is our forcast for today, between 6 am 1 pm we expect severe 500's. In the afternoon the 500 wil slowly move away but there is still a high risk of local 500's.
[16:34] <Kabouter> http://www.thq-games.com/uk/thqtv/index/5398?movieId=3177 < lol @ Red Dawn the game
[16:34] <EviLore> stump: i7 920 is great, but the price of the chip isn't the concern there, it's the price of the motherboard.  about $100 higher on average than an lga 775 mobo
[16:35] <stump-work> Yikes.
[16:35] <stump-work> *sighs* what a shitty time for someone to decide to buy a desktop
[16:35] <EviLore> ddr3 ram has dropped significantly at least
[16:35] <stump-work> yeah, I was encouraged by those numbers.
[16:35] <dazzgc> evilore, when i play cod WaW, whenever there is large amounts of smoke, the game slows to 30~fps, and i know its not my videocard, my cpu is a e8400, is that the bottleneck?
[16:35] <dazzgc> well, in your opinion
[16:35] <itsgreen> I recently build a system for a friend of mine we went with the Q8400
[16:36] <Tiduz> wat
[16:36] <EviLore> dazz: not enough information
[16:36] <Tiduz> mgs pc?
[16:36] <Tiduz> hotttt
[16:36] <EviLore> yes, mgs:r is coming to pc
[16:36] <stump-work> Tiduz: now you can pirate it!
[16:36] <Tiduz> awesome
[16:36] <dazzgc> 285gtx, vista, 8GB ddr2
[16:36] <Oldschoolgamer> lol
[16:36] <dazzgc> cpu@3.2ghz
[16:36] <Tiduz> 60 fps plz
[16:36] <Magus> <@EviLore> http://ve3dmedia.ign.com/images/05/14/51444_TheSecretOfMonkeyIslandSpecialEdition-CharacterArt-07.jpg -> he looks milo creepy
[16:36] <Tiduz> stump; its not even that, itll lookk omfg wow
[16:36] <Tiduz> ;D
[16:36] <EviLore> dazz: strange
[16:37] <dazzgc> its only when smoke grenades go up, or a lot of particle effects
[16:37] <Kagari> lol
[16:37] <dazzgc> and its only really in cod4 and cod waw
[16:37] <Kagari> that milo demo was creepy
[16:37] <stump-work> also, what's the preferred _silent_ tower case right now? Silence is important. I got some random silent altec lansing a few years ago the last time I bought a desktop.
[16:37] <ElyrionX> stump: I just asked the exact same question in the pc building thread lol
[16:37] <EviLore> in cod4 too?  
[16:38] <dazzgc> yep cod4 too
[16:38] <ElyrionX> stump: I meant when it comes to the i7
[16:38] <dazzgc> like in the 2nd level flying over in the chopper, when the smoke appears, slowdown
[16:38] <stump-work> ElyrionX: well let me know what you end up deciding.
[16:38] <EviLore> dunno mang, you should be getting triple digit faps in both games with your hardware, I'm thinking. 
[16:38] <ElyrionX> stump: I'm still deciding whether to bite the bullet now or to hold out until a few months later
[16:39] <EviLore> I jumped on i7 when I found out that nothing better is going to come out until q2 2010
[16:39] <ElyrionX> stump: http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=16120751&postcount=5838
[16:39] <dazzgc> yeah thats what i thought. even tho cpu is old its not old to the point where it should halt to 30fps
[16:39] <dazzgc> every other game runs great
[16:40] <dazzgc> 60fps@1080p with loads of aa
[16:40] <ElyrionX> EviLore: how big is the performance gain compared to the older duo/quads?
[16:40] <Vagabond> so when is the sony / nintendo conferences?
[16:40] <ElyrionX> EviLore: In terms of the price:performance value?
[16:41] <itsgreen> Ok, last time I checked the Q8400 had the best price performance ratio, but the I7 will around longer
[16:41] <sprusk> ugh i am having some hardcore hiccups
[16:41] <itsgreen> so will be more relevant in a year or two
[16:41] <Kagari> Vagabond, 12PM EDT
[16:41] <EviLore> gaming performance varies, but it's a monster overclocker and the general usage performance is very good
[16:42] <ElyrionX> Shit you're right about the i7 mobos, those things are insanely expensive
[16:42] <EviLore> plus you get to have this

[16:42] * Lone has joined #GA
[16:42] <itsgreen> ElyrionX why dont you wait for the Core I5?
[16:42] <Lone> So I says to Mable, I says
[16:43] <itsgreen> the early tests indicate better performance than the I7 920
[16:43] <ElyrionX> itsgreen: When do those hit?
[16:43] <itsgreen> em let me check
[16:43] <ElyrionX> admittedly i still need to do my research. Kind of tied up now with other stuff. Gonna look into it seriously next week. I'm just trying to get a feel of what's happening now
[16:44] <itsgreen> september
[16:44] <itsgreen> http://anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=3570&p=1
[16:44] <dazzgc> i hope waggle never affects pc gaming
[16:44] <Kabouter> I think i'll skip I7 unless it takes forever for them to release something else :P
[16:44] <Lone> At least we got to talk about Conan for a little bit
[16:44] <FirewalkR> i went i7 920 and gtx260/216 some months ago and never looked back (and practically abandoned my consoles in the process)
[16:45] <BudokaiMR2> what is the next confernece?
[16:45] <BudokaiMR2> sony or ninty?
[16:45] <ElyrionX> nin
[16:45] <Acosta> ninty
[16:45] <Unison_> nintendo in 2 hours
[16:45] <ElyrionX> Wow the i5 sounds like a better bang for the buck
[16:45] <stump-work> sony is 2 hours after that
[16:46] <Acosta> I'm going to wait after summer
[16:46] <Acosta> then I will check prices
[16:46] <ElyrionX> september is just nice for a new rig too
[16:46] <ElyrionX> just nice for l4d 2 and sc2 and dragon age
[16:46] <Acosta> my q6600 and geforce 8800 gts caan't grant me 60 fps with aaa and v-sync for the rest of gen
[16:46] <Acosta> so I will make a partial upgrade
[16:46] <Acosta> can't spend too much money
[16:47] <Kabouter> My E8500 and 4870 can't grant me that right now either
[16:47] <Kabouter> Not in every game anyway
[16:47] <ElyrionX> i hate to upgrade my pc
[16:47] <ElyrionX> it's always something bottlenecking something else
[16:47] <dazzgc> i want an i7
[16:47] <dazzgc> im happy with my 285gtx
[16:47] <dazzgc> <3
[16:47] <KimiNewt> goddammit
[16:48] <Kabouter> Yeah, me too actually ElyrionX
[16:48] <KimiNewt> I can't believe I didn't work out even fucking once. Past me pisses me off sometimes
[16:48] <ElyrionX> what's the sweet spot for video cards now?
[16:48] <ElyrionX> gtx275?
[16:49] <ElyrionX> Kabouter: yeah so the lesson learnt is whenever I want better performance, i buy a whole new rig
[16:49] <Kabouter> Preeeetty much that for me
[16:49] * Grecco has joined #GA
[16:49] <KimiNewt> I have the GTX260 and it serves me well but I don't really play graphics-extensive games
[16:49] <ElyrionX> of course that means i haven't bought anything pc-related for the last five years lol
[16:49] <KimiNewt> I've got TF2 at ~200FPS and that's more than enough

[16:52] <stump-work> All the conferences are normally 60 or 90 minutes.
[16:52] <Kagari> Ubisoft's event was way too long
[16:52] <EviLore> except for the legend of ubisoft
[16:52] <Kagari> lol
[16:53] <stump-work> Ubisoft's event also ran about 15 minutes too long because they screwed the pooch on the pele trailer
[16:53] <stump-work> and Cameron definitely wasn't scheduled for that long
[16:53] <Kabouter> Two hours and fifteen minutes of glory that I missed :(
[16:53] <Unison_> hahaha
[16:53] <darkh_coffee> MS was 2 hours...but they kept it moving
[16:53] <Kagari> James Cameron is very long winded
[16:53] * darkh_coffee is now known as darkh23
[16:53] <Kabouter> MS was pretty slow too
[16:53] <Unison_> kab you missed the worst conference ever
[16:53] <Unison_> haha
[16:53] <Kabouter> EA really kept things moving
[16:53] <Kabouter> I heard Unison
[16:53] <Lone> haha
[16:53] <Kagari> I missed a lot of EA cause we ended up going to dinner
[16:53] <Kabouter> I'm bumping MS to a 0
[16:54] <Kabouter> To make room for Ubi
[16:54] <Unison_> haha fair enough
[16:54] <Unison_> me too
[16:54] <Unison_> haha
[16:54] <stump-work> ahahaha
[16:54] <impirius> oh god, the ubisoft conference
[16:54] <stump-work> you guys are lunatics, MS's conference was good :p
[16:54] <Unison_> you want a 0?
[16:54] <impirius> i thought it was just a fever dream
[16:54] <Unison_> BAM THERE IT IS
[16:54] <Unison_> WHABAM
[16:54] <Lone> WHABAM
[16:54] <Kagari> stump, it was okay. The only game I want from them though is Alan Wake, which looks amazing
[16:54] <jett\bizarro-jesus> the sony conference is in 4 hours, right?
[16:55] <impirius> i believe so
[16:55] <Lone> Ever want to know what's on the bottom of a Chia Pet?  BAm
[16:55] <jett\bizarro-jesus> kagari: pc version ftw
[16:55] <Kagari> jett, indeed
[16:55] <Kagari> Need to upgrade my processor first
[16:55] <jett\bizarro-jesus> seriously, how many 360-only exclusives did microsoft had? Halo...and halo?
[16:55] <Unison_> urrm what?
[16:55] <Tony_Parker> cracksniff 2
[16:55] <Unison_> Splinter Cell
[16:55] <Kagari> crackdown
[16:55] <Unison_> Alan Wake
[16:55] <impirius> left 4 dead 2 was console exclusive
[16:55] <Unison_> Crackdown 2
[16:56] <Unison_> Left 4 Dead 2
[16:56] <Kagari> splinter cell and alan wake are on pc
[16:56] <Unison_> don't be dumb jett
[16:56] <FirewalkR> well, since gaf seems to have quite a lot of bacon fans: http://www.motivatedphotos.com/?id=14629
[16:56] <Lone> Crackdown 1 was 2nd party, right?
[16:56] <stump-work> NSFW dummy
[16:56] <Kagari> Lone, yes
[16:56] <stump-work> Lone: if by 2nd party you mean externally developed, but IP owned and published by MS, yes.
[16:56] <FirewalkR> oh btw not much sfw too
[16:56] <Lone> that, yeah
[16:56] <Kagari> I'm surprised MS didnt secure ABP
[16:56] <jett\bizarro-jesus> unison: PC motherfucker
[16:57] <Unison_> like that counts
[16:57] <darkh23> unison they rather upgrade their PC for those than buy a dirty 360
[16:57] <Lone> so...Crackdown 2...isn't that much of a stretch...right, even though they broke off with the dev
[16:57] <jett\bizarro-jesus> the only 360-only exclusive is crackdown
[16:57] <Unison_> haha dark
[16:57] <jett\bizarro-jesus> which i don't give a fuck about
[16:57] <stump-work> Kagari: well they pretty much funded Ruffian to leave RTW just to do Crackdown 2 so I suspect it's more a case of not wanting it.
[16:57] <FirewalkR> wasn't APB demo'd on an MS conference for the first time?
[16:57] <Kagari> ah
[16:57] <jett\bizarro-jesus> my new video card only cost 100 bucks, fuck consoles, in the butt
[16:57] <stump-work> APB had... a troubled development history
[16:57] <Unison_> well, being an S-tard you aren't their target audience
[16:57] <stump-work> FirewalkR: EA. Who are distroing/pubbing
[16:57] <Unison_> so no harm, no foul
[16:57] <darkh23> lol
[16:58] <jett\bizarro-jesus> fucking xbot
[16:58] <Unison_> haha
[16:58] <darkh23> lol
[16:58] <Kagari> lol
[16:58] <Unison_> yeah i am totally xboxin'
[16:58] <jett\bizarro-jesus> BACK OFF XBOT
[16:59] <Tony_Parker> open up OT plz
[17:00] <impirius> soon it will all go down in flames anyway
[17:00] <impirius> if google switched all of their servers to hosting gaf, it would fail during nintendo's conference
[17:01] <jett\bizarro-jesus> Metal Gear 360-exclusive game announced http://i42.tinypic.com/qr12lk.png
[17:01] * syllogism has joined #GA
[17:01] <darkh23> haha I love the philosophy in this MGS:R thread "eh its not MGS4....so no big deal"
[17:02] <FirewalkR> i shall have my rising metal gear on PC, thank you
[17:02] <Jide> because it could potentially be worse than mgs4
[17:02] <impirius> i am excited to see what a metal gear game can be within the confines of 9GB space
[17:02] <FirewalkR> it's all coz it's raiden
[17:02] <jett\bizarro-jesus> mgs4 was always the xbot holy grail
[17:03] * E3MarkMan has quit IRC (Quit: )
[17:03] <Kagari> you'd think if they were to port it
[17:03] <Kagari> they'd say by now
[17:03] <jett\bizarro-jesus> that thing is locked down
[17:03] <Lone> MGS4 on 4 DVD's!
[17:04] <Lone> Probably should have been 4 Blu Rays...stupid Level HD saving...
[17:04] <Kagari> the installs were pointless
[17:05] <impirius> you know you liked watching snake smoke for a few minutes
[17:05] <Kagari> lol
[17:05] <stump-work> but you can go make a sandwich!!!!
[17:05] <stump-work> what are you, fat and lazy, go make a sandwich!!!!
[17:05] <Lone> But I wanted to slaughter hundreds of poor people
[17:05] <impirius> MGS4 promotes positive game-life balance
[17:05] <stump-work> i for one appreciate that time so i can go make a sandwich!!!
[17:05] <impirius> it's basically MGS Fit
[17:05] <stump-work> that was very surreal. a spontaneous outpouring of sandwich love when MGS4 released.
[17:05] <Unison_> http://i44.tinypic.com/2ylljrs.gif
[17:05] <Unison_> HAHA

[17:06] <Unison_> i can't believe people can pretend like that was anything but a disgrace
[17:06] <Unison_> haha
[17:06] <Kagari> the motion cam?
[17:06] <Lone> you know, I wonder if there is enough green in that gif, that someone can just cut her out, and have that by itself
[17:06] <Lone> to use in other things
[17:06] <impirius> Xbox Conference Green Screen Challenge!
[17:06] <Unison_> haha
[17:07] <Kagari> The elephant painting thing was hilarious
[17:07] <Lone> say, have her dancing in the background of Obama's Inauguration
[17:07] <darkh23> tiduz is surrounded by candles right now....holding a prayer meeting so that Sony does not reveal the waggle wand
[17:07] <Kagari> lol
[17:07] <Unison_> hahaha
[17:07] <impirius> have her flailing at the warhawk controller guy
[17:07] <Unison_> haha imp
[17:07] <impirius> or have both of them dancing to ravi drums
[17:07] <Kagari> I really hope they dont either
[17:07] <Kagari> screw motion control
[17:07] <Lone> dancing at a Nazi March from old War videos
[17:08] <Unison_> motion control is awful haha
[17:08] <stump-work> it's pretty much a lock at this point
[17:08] <Kagari> Yes, yes it is
[17:08] <Unison_> YOU ARE THE WHEEL

[17:08] <Tiduz> goty

[23:08] <Somnia> Sony stole E3
[23:08] <atomsk> what was the other secret game?
[23:08] <EviLore> sony wins with PEACE WALKER

[23:08] <Tiduz\`> Sony had the best
[23:08] <Kabouter> Sony > Nintendo > MS > EA >>>>> Ubisoft
[23:08] <Unison_> yeah actually
[23:08] <Lone> Nintendo had 1 1/5 ok games on it
[23:08] <jett\UEDA-FTW> atomsk: FF14 + Racerwhatever
[23:08] <Wes_> sony won half way through their conference
[23:08] <Tiduz\`> guess im biased
[23:08] <Somnia> Sony's conference was by far the best
[23:08] <Vagabond> how could anyone put Nintendo over Sony
[23:08] <Unison_> MS: 0 / Sony: 1 / Nintendo: 6
[23:08] <jj984jj> sony once again showed a bunch of stuff coming out way later, MS won for me
[23:08] <avcables> <+Tiduz\`> Sony had the best <- loooooooooooooooooool good opinions
[23:08] <Tiduz\`> Most games

[23:17] <KimiNewt> I'm seeing bad screenshots but are the graphics in NSMBWii pretty much the same as the DS version?

[23:17] <Tiduz\`> FFXIV was pretty interesting
[23:17] <Tiduz\`> for mmo fans

[23:19] <iSony> Wurm: think it might be outbreak or some shit
[23:19] <Wes_> Trico = Last Guardian
[23:19] <Wurm> going by what?
[23:19] <Wes_> GT5 has Nascar.
[23:19] <Amir0x> Mario Galaxy 1.5
[23:19] <Tiduz\`> Amir0x
[23:20] <Amir0x> what
[23:20] <Wes_> erm
[23:20] <Tiduz\`> YOU MISSED TRICO
[23:20] <iSony> it worked exactlu the same tiduz
[23:20] <Maxrpg> Nintendo: Super Mario Galaxy 2, New Super Mario Bros Wii
[23:20] <jett\UEDA-FTW> amir0x: trico, GT5 with CAR DAMAGE, GOW3, motion controller thing
[23:20] <Unison_> you're an idiot if you troll Mario Galaxy 2
[23:20] <Amir0x> What
[23:20] <Amir0x> WHAT WHAT
[23:20] <impirius> sony conference: MGS 3.5 on PSP, sony camera + dildo wand motion controller
[23:20] <Tiduz\`> YES
[23:20] <Tiduz\`> TRICO
[23:20] <Wes_> Mari Galaxy 2 with Yoshi.
[23:20] * Popopop has joined #GA
[23:20] <Tiduz\`> And
[23:20] <Maxrpg> yup with yoshi
[23:20] <Unison_> Galaxy 2 looked hot
[23:20] <Amir0x> MARIO GALAXY 2
[23:20] <Tiduz\`> METAL GEAR SOLID 3 PSP SEQUEKL
[23:20] <impirius> oh and they revealed something called a "PSP Go"
[23:20] <Amir0x> FUCK ME IN MY ASS
[23:20] <Tiduz\`> looked AMAZING
[23:20] <Amir0x> FUCK ME IN MY ASS
[23:20] <EviLore> okay, my conclusions for the sony conference
[23:20] <iSony> resi psp
[23:20] <EviLore> +Peace Walker, holy shit MGS3 sequel!  
[23:20] <EviLore> +Trico looks wonderful.
[23:20] <EviLore> +Sony's waggle actually looks like the best tech of the three, though early.
[23:20] <EviLore> +Gran Turismo 5 with WRC and NASCAR licenses, wow!
[23:20] <EviLore> +Ass Creed 2 looks fully realized, really impressed, will buy PC version.
[23:20] <EviLore> +GT Mobile finally, took long enough.  ~GT4 graphics, looks good.
[23:20] <EviLore> -Uncharted 2 has nice visuals, but the shooting did not impress.  Reminds me of Kane and Lynch with the solid line gunfire, and it's absolutely absurd that a gunship cannon isn't penetrating an office table.  
[23:20] <EviLore> -Kart racer game looks to have horrid gameplay.
[23:20] <EviLore> -God of War 3 is GoW2 HD, not impressed.
[23:20] <EviLore> -I read GAF during the Home garbage.
[23:20] <Popopop> Nintendo fans are crazy
[23:20] <Amir0x> Is Sony waggle for Ps4
[23:20] <Amir0x> or is it gonna be an intermediary thing
[23:20] <FirewalkR> Just judging by the reactions in #ga, I'd say Sony clearly won. Nothing in MS or Nintendo's conference caused the same reactions here as MGS PSP or FFXIV
[23:20] <Tiduz\`> ps3
[23:20] <Tiduz\`> with camera
[23:21] <Popopop> that was a horrible conference
[23:21] <jman2050> TvC is online
[23:21] <jman2050> nice

[23:21] <iSony> did you judge mobiles graphics from cg?
[23:21] <Tiduz\`> jman2050 WAT
[23:21] <Tiduz\`> jman2050 WAT
[23:21] <Wes_> No +/- on the SE stuff EviL?
[23:21] <Tiduz\`> DO WANT

[23:21] <Amir0x> you fucking tricked me
[23:21] <Tiduz\`> Unison ill let you kick my ass
[23:21] <Amir0x> this isn't Mario Galaxy 2
[23:21] <iSony> jman2050: repeat that
[23:21] <Tiduz\`> Amir0x: mario galaxy 2 too

[23:22] <jake3hk> god of war on g4
[23:23] <Amir0x> Does God of War look hot?
[23:23] <jake3hk> not rly
[23:23] <iSony> no
[23:23] <Grecco> Looks good
[23:23] <impirius> god of war looks like you'd think god of war would look
[23:23] <iSony> ac2 looks better
[23:23] <jman2050> oh there's a trailer
[23:23] <Grecco> but Trico was the star of the sony show
[23:23] <Wurm> wonder what Agent is
[23:23] <jman2050> didn't even notice
[23:23] <Grecco> AC looks better too
[23:23] <Wurm> and when we'll see it
[23:23] <Unison_> God of War just looks like 2 in HD
[23:23] <Unison_> nothing special
[23:23] <impirius> GoW2 + HD + HD textures
[23:23] <iSony> nolf with a guy
[23:23] <Jideo> there wasn't anything new combat wise 
[23:23] <impirius> yes
[23:23] <Jideo> either 
[23:23] <Unison_> solid, if not spectacular
[23:23] <Unison_> haha
[23:23] <impirius> subtle beauty
[23:23] <Wes_> They did a 256 live battle in MAG but everyone here hated it because of the graphics I think.
[23:23] <impirius> wait wrong franchise
[23:23] <ElyrionOrin> im really disappointed the next big MGS game is on a fucking handheld
[23:23] <ElyrionOrin> FFS
[23:23] * iSony is now known as iAlone
[23:24] <Maxrpg> Orin: did you miss 360?
[23:24] <Maxrpg> LIGHTNING BOLT ACTION
[23:24] <ElyrionOrin> I'm not Orin
[23:24] <Jideo> 256 people it was never going to look good on a ps3 
[23:24] <jake3hk> no ac2 videos yet :(
[23:24] <Kagari> Is that Rising game being worked on by Kojima though?
[23:24] <Amir0x> i gotta say though
[23:24] <EviLore> oh, yeah, and
[23:24] <Amir0x> Nintendo's reliance on Mario is fucking embarrassing at this point
[23:24] <EviLore> -MAG looks like Quake 1
[23:24] <Amir0x> that makes like twelve Mario games for Wii right now
[23:25] <speedpop> not as if that is anything new Amir0x
[23:25] * Eric-E3 has joined #GA
[23:25] <KimiNewt> there was a hilarious point the in the conference I just watched
[23:25] <Amir0x> and no Pikmin 3 i assume
[23:25] <Wurm> no proper NSMB2 is lame
[23:25] <Wurm> mega lame
[23:25] <FnordChan> Amir0x:  It's quite embarassing to see them continuing to exploit something that makes them so much money.  I'm disgusted, personally.
[23:25] <Maxrpg> what about Sin and Punishment 2!?
[23:25] <EviLore> NSMB wii is zzzzzz
[23:25] <KimiNewt> Where that dumbass mom nintendo woman was bragging about them announcing 4 Mario games that conference
[23:25] <iAlone> trailer up
[23:25] <EviLore> mario galaxy 2 I will buy
[23:25] <Amir0x> FnordChan: It is when every other company has the brains to try to delve into new IPs, new strategies and cover all bases.
[23:25] <Wurm> oh wait
[23:25] <iAlone> fuck that - coop mario ftw
[23:25] <Amir0x> Nintendo is the only bunch of pussies who can release fifty Marios and please its pathetic fanbas.e
[23:25] <Wurm> amirox doesnt know about the new wii peripheral
[23:25] <Wurm> ami, holy shit son
[23:26] <Wurm> this peripheral right..
[23:26] <Wurm> it reads your fucking PULSE
[23:26] <jman2050> ahahaha
[23:26] <Unison_> anyone who didnt play NSMB multiplayer has no right to talk shit about NSMBWii, as that shit was way fun
[23:26] <jman2050> that was so retarded
[23:26] <Maxrpg> HAHAHA
[23:26] * jj984jj has joined #GA
[23:26] <bluemaxwork> ill admit
[23:26] <Wes_> Lie Detection game
[23:26] <jj984jj> no pikmin ami :(
[23:26] <bluemaxwork> the nsmb multi on ds was fun
[23:26] <iAlone> Unison_: i agree
[23:26] <avcablesE3sux> you don't play as samus in metroid: other m
[23:26] <avcablesE3sux> that's so weak
[23:26] <Wurm> what
[23:26] <Tony_Parker> G4
[23:26] <Tony_Parker> it's JACK
[23:26] <FnordChan> Amir0x: I dunno, if you're expecting Nintendo to really concentrate on developing new IP at this point, I don't know what to tell you.  They're making vast sums of money beating their IP into the ground repeatedly and selling casual games.  I wouldn't expect that to change any time soon.
[23:26] <iAlone> Unison_: casshern is in
[23:26] <Amir0x> Well then you shouldn't expect me to stop criticizing it any time soon.
[23:27] <Amir0x> When one stops, so does the other
[23:27] <Amir0x> they're connected by DNA
[23:27] <Unison_> thank goodness
[23:27] <Unison_> as casshern is the best character
[23:27] <iAlone> hakushons out i think
[23:27] <Wurm> was a date mentioned for Last Guardian at all?
[23:27] <Grecco> no
[23:27] <jman2050> am I the only one that doesn't actually care about IPs other than the fact that they indicate established gameplay conventions?
[23:27] <iAlone> gatsuman
[23:27] <FnordChan> Amir0x:  Go wild, man.  I just think you're barking up the wrong tree.
[23:27] <Wurm> because I want it all over my face
[23:27] <bluemaxwork> no wurm
[23:27] <bluemaxwork> sadly
[23:27] <Unison_> oh who cares haha
[23:27] <Amir0x> where is fucking TRICO on IGN
[23:27] <Unison_> he was unlockable anyhow
[23:27] <jman2050> like, I like Mario games. Mario games play awesome, therefore a new Mario game is a good thing
[23:27] <Wurm> so might not even be 2010 :(
[23:27] <Amir0x> goddamn it i need the video
[23:27] <jman2050> simple
[23:27] <Unison_> ami it was the same trailer
[23:27] <bluemaxwork> is there a hd trico trailer yet
[23:27] <Maxrpg> amir0x: same video
[23:27] <Unison_> almost identical
[23:27] <Amir0x> really
[23:27] <Amir0x> REALLY
[23:27] <Amir0x> laaaame
[23:27] <bluemaxwork> it had new footage
[23:27] <bluemaxwork> at the end
[23:27] <Maxrpg> yup
[23:27] <Unison_> yes
[23:27] <Wurm> was not the same at all
[23:27] <impirius> all i know is that i love mario galaxy and that they are making a sequel
[23:27] <Wurm> was massively improved
[23:27] <ElyrionOrin> i might be more excited for Trico if it wasn't for the fact that the bird thing looked hideous
[23:28] <jman2050> it's like people complaining about Capcom whoring Mega Man
[23:28] <jman2050> who cares
[23:28] <Unison_> some new footage but almost the same
[23:28] <Unison_> and some extra bloom
[23:28] <jman2050> the games rule
[23:28] <Wurm> no
[23:28] * Eric-E3 has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[23:28] <Wes_> It had new footage and it had been tweaked
[23:28] <Amir0x> jman: I would care if ALL Capcom made was Megaman
[23:28] <bluemaxwork> no jman
[23:28] <Wurm> do not listen to these awful bad people
[23:28] <bluemaxwork> its creatively bankrupt ;-)
[23:28] <Amir0x> but they make a fifty trillion different games and new IPs every year
[23:28] * zawa has quit IRC (Quit: rape can be moe too)
[23:28] <Wurm> it looked orders of magnitude better
[23:28] <Amir0x> Nintendo has like five Ips they molest day in and day out
[23:28] <jman2050> and even in Mario's case, they're all basically just there for brand recognition
[23:28] <Amir0x> Like seriously, the IPs have been raped.
[23:28] <iAlone> Unison_: ww online not limited to friends
[23:28] <Maxrpg> oh amir0x: New Super Mario Bros Wii BRINGS BACK SUITS!!!!!!
[23:28] <Unison_> awesome
[23:28] <Wurm> Imagine COPZ was probably my favourite Nintendo game shown
[23:28] <jman2050> since each Mario game plays pretty differently
[23:28] <jett\UEDA-FTW> i really, really HATE the non-descript, netural artstyle of NewSuperMarioBros
[23:28] <impirius> amirox, when they deviate from their IPs, we get wii music.  don't encourage them
[23:28] <Maxrpg> There's a Propeller Suit and a Penguin Suit!
[23:28] <jett\UEDA-FTW> it just looks bland
[23:28] <jman2050> the Galaxy 2 announcement was legitimately shocking
[23:29] <Wes_> oh new FF13 trailer too with english VA.
[23:29] <Amir0x> lol how did junkwaffle get the Nintendo conference thread
[23:29] <jett\UEDA-FTW> galaxy2 looks like a cash-in
[23:29] <jman2050> cause it's the first time in forever they took a game and actually made a direct gameplay sequel
[23:29] <Amir0x> Wii Will Rock U made the original thread and it got locked?
[23:29] <iAlone> galaxy looked like... galaxy 1 :/
[23:29] <iAlone> not excited
[23:29] * Somnia is now known as Somnia_Backsoon
[23:29] <jman2050> more of galaxy is never a bad thing
[23:29] <Amir0x> <impirius> amirox, when they deviate from their IPs, we get wii music.  don't encourage them
[23:29] <Maxrpg> oh shit YOSHI is in NSMBwii!
[23:29] <Lone> I know iAlone
[23:29] <Amir0x> There was a time we got Pikmin and Chibi Robo.
[23:29] <Amir0x> I guess that time is over :(
[23:29] <Lone> more of GOW is never a bad thing either
[23:29] <Grecco> Im baffled. We get L4D2 a year later and people blow their load. We get Galaxy 2 2 years later and its meh
[23:29] <jman2050> if Nintendo released a sequel to SMB3 that played like SMB3 on steroids people would go apeshit
[23:29] <impirius> chibi robo <3
[23:30] <jman2050> like people are going apeshit for Galaxy 2
[23:30] <Amir0x> i don't think Galaxy 2 is meh
[23:30] <iAlone> still vt, red steel and metroid
[23:30] <Amir0x> I am legitimately excited about Galaxy 2
[23:30] <Lone> I didn't blow my load on L4D2
[23:30] <Armitage> metroid trailer
[23:30] <Amir0x> it is just in contrast to the other console makers that it shows how embarrassingly poor Nintendo's lineup is at this point.
[23:30] <Armitage> wtf did i just watch
[23:30] <iAlone> oh right dead space wii
[23:30] <Amir0x> I mean, not one but TWO Marios
[23:30] <Amir0x> they had to be patting themselves on the back.
[23:30] <jake3hk> heavy rain on g4
[23:30] <iAlone> Armitage: :)

[23:31] <jj984jj> they showed a Team Ninja 3rd person 3D Metroid and what Retro's working on remained unannounced
[23:31] <Amir0x> nobody said anything about this
[23:31] <Lone> Metroid was all they showed that really piqued my interest
[23:31] <Maxrpg> amir0x? wat
[23:31] <Wurm> The sony waggle embarrassed it
[23:31] <Wes_> its just a port

[23:36] <iAlone> youre all over waggle now that sony is doing it
[23:36] <KimiNewt> I mean the real new ones, not shitty spinoffs
[23:36] <Wes_> Well I'm no expert. But when I was watching the nintendo conference I thought it was just KH1 and 2 ported to Wii.
[23:36] <bluemaxwork> nope
[23:37] <bluemaxwork> no pokemon at all
[23:37] <Tiduz\`> all over?
[23:37] <Wes_> but i could be wrong.

[23:37] <Nikashi> KH3 should have Enix stuff in it too
[23:38] <Tiduz\`> just because i dont like my wii fitness coach doesnt mena you have to hate me

[23:38] <Tiduz\`> why query you?

[23:40] <jman2050> I have all 3 systems
[23:40] <jman2050> so I don't give a shit
[23:40] <Maxrpg> Monado I mean

[23:48] <Magus> what remains?
[23:48] <Wurm> ODST for $60
[23:49] <Wurm> the joke of the year

[23:49] <Tre`> another gameplay interview
[23:49] <Grecco> + Final Fantasy 14 PS3 Exclusive. This was a big surprise to me. I would have never expected Square to announce a PS3 exclusive ever again. A reverse megaton compared to Microsoft's showing last year with FF13 going multiplatform.
[23:49] <Grecco> lulz
[23:49] <Kabouter> Halo: ODST was awful

[23:50] <Magus> for me it goes Nintendo > Sony > Microsoft
[23:50] <Tre`> jett:  not really, because GT5's still never coming out
[23:50] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> wow, they're actually showing the good beatles songs here
[23:50] <Kabouter> They absolutely are not in any way KimiNewt
[23:50] <Wes_> Who was it that said Release FF13 and 14 in the same year was a mistake? As if fans arent going to buy both.
[23:50] <Lone> Kab, can't you instead, just want Hannah Montana, CakeManias, and the like-type games to die instead
[23:50] <Magus> sony had a good show with the motion controller
[23:50] <KimiNewt> Why not?
[23:50] <Kabouter> No Lone
[23:50] <Jideo> wes indeed
[23:50] <Wurm> why is this Sin and Punishment trailer the same thing they showed last year
[23:50] <Magus> were microsoft was like "IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH MORE AWESOMER THAN THAT LAME THING!"
[23:50] <Kabouter> Those have more of a right to exist than MMO's do!
[23:50] <KimiNewt> If people enjoy them then what's the problem
[23:50] <Wurm> what the fuck is going on with this game
[23:50] <Tre`> FFXI was SO BAD
[23:50] <Amir0x> RED FACTION IS HERE
[23:50] <Amir0x> OHBOYOHBOY
[23:50] <Tre`> why would you want FFXIV
[23:51] <Kabouter> Well, people enjoy heroin too KimiNewt
[23:51] <KimiNewt> People buy them and pay monthly so it's worth it
[23:51] <bluemaxwork> i have no faith in ffxiv being good
[23:51] <Lone> why would you want _____
[23:51] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> FF is bad, doesn't stop suckers from snapping it up
[23:51] <KimiNewt> Everything is worth what its purchaser would pay for it!
[23:51] <Wes_> Because people have a boring RL.
[23:51] <Tre`> Lone:  but FFXI was BAD
[23:51] <Maxrpg> tre: if it's better than FFXI, that's why
[23:51] <Firestorm> umw tf Wes
[23:51] <Firestorm> they're not going to buy both
[23:51] <Wes_> you woud hope they had learnt their mistakes for FF14
[23:51] <Tiduz\`> any other conferences today???
[23:51] <Firestorm> FF14 ONLINE
[23:51] <Tre`> it could be 60000x better than FFXI
[23:51] <Tre`> and still be total fucking shit
[23:51] <Firestorm> dunno anyone who bought FFXI
[23:51] <Tre`> that's how bad FFXI was
[23:51] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> well it has been what, 7 years now
[23:51] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> haha tre
[23:51] <Nikashi> Hey Shin
[23:51] <Maxrpg> only one way to know though
[23:51] <Tre`> yes
[23:51] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> hey
[23:51] <Tre`> by shitting on it endlessly
[23:52] <Tre`> that's how I know
[23:52] <EviLore> surprised they didn't show starhawk
[23:52] <Lone> wait, you didn't play FFXI more than 20 minutes, now that I remember it
[23:52] <TEEEPO> starhawk :(
[23:52] <Maxrpg> brilliant deduction 
[23:52] <Tre`> Starhawk would've been game of the show
[23:52] <TEEEPO> no show
[23:52] <Wes_> Firestorm: People who want to buy both are still going to buy both. They're not going to think "hmmm I better only get one!"
[23:52] <Tre`> Lone:  uhhhhhhh no
[23:52] <Tre`> try again
[23:52] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> why show a game that won't be out for a year?
[23:52] <TEEEPO> who wants to play warhawk right now
[23:52] <TEEEPO> anyways
[23:52] <Tre`> add a lot more hours to that
[23:52] <TEEEPO> anyoneeee
[23:52] <Wes_> oh yeah
[23:52] <kassatsu> there are some street fighter 4 tournment vids on hong kong psn
[23:52] <Wes_> where was Starhawk?
[23:52] <TEEEPO> starhawk was just registered
[23:52] <Wes_> or the price drop?
[23:52] <Wurm> man, 1ups live blog is appalling
[23:52] <Lone> go ahead, say it, you were a Rank 10 level 75 guy, right
[23:52] <iAlone> Shinobi_NadaLOL: half the games were spring 2010
[23:52] <Tre`> haha fuck no
[23:52] <iAlone> and thats without dekays
[23:52] <Wurm> is there a way we can get all of 1up fired finally
[23:53] <Tre`> I would never play FFXI that long
[23:53] <TEEEPO> i got to lvl 14 in ff11
[23:53] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> of course
[23:53] <Lone> yeah, 25 minutes
[23:53] <Tre`> I quit around the beach area
[23:53] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> e3 is basically about showing next year's shit
[23:53] <TEEEPO> such a waste of life
[23:53] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> been that way since 2003
[23:53] <Firestorm> How much is FF7 on PSN?

[23:57] <Jideo> but I still watched it like a fool :( 
[23:57] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> I play fifa 09 and that's more or less it
[23:58] <jett\UEDA-FTW> now that sega is dead i don't think e3 is ever gonna be interesting for you shinobi
[23:58] <Nikashi> Shinobi_NadaLOL: I was impressed with Conviction I have to say
[23:58] <Shinobi_NadaLOL> I wouldn't buy a wii on a bet, so nintendo news isn't really gonna do much for me
