[01:01] * Sandoon has joined #wikipedia-en
[01:01] <J_Milburn> Ironholds; I'm sorry about the way your RfA is going, I really am alarmed :(
[01:02] <J_Milburn> It's interesting how there are a lot of what I would quite happily call problem editors in the oppose section
[01:02] <J_Milburn> And very few admins
[01:02] <Shirik> note: alarmed != surprised
[01:02] <Sandoon> Hello
[01:02] <J_Milburn> I am both alarmed AND surprised
[01:02] <MisterWiki> hello Sandoon
[01:03] <Sandoon> How Are you?
[01:03] * AFK_Thing has joined #wikipedia-en
[01:03] <MisterWiki> Fine. You?
[01:03] <MisterWiki> Hi AFK_Thing
[01:03] * The_Thing has quit IRC (Nick collision from services.)
[01:03] * Simon is now known as Sideards
[01:03] * AFK_Thing is now known as The_Thing
[01:03] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: Ehh, tis fine. Not your fault.
[01:03] <Ironholds> it does highlight a massive problem with democracy, admittedly
[01:04] <J_Milburn> Now, you know as well as I do that democracy doesn't work
[01:04] <Ironholds> you have to allow for the fact that idiots get a vote :P
[01:04] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: Democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding what to have for lunch
[01:04] * jd|food is now known as jdelanoy
[01:05] <J_Milburn> Ironholds, where do you stand on the political spectrum?
[01:05] * mareklug has quit IRC
[01:05] <Sandoon> Great!
[01:05] <J_Milburn> (I must have never heard ThouShaltNot before, I thought they were much less cabaret than this)
[01:06] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: I tend to slouch rather than stand
[01:06] <jdelanoy> heh
[01:06] * Sandoon has quit IRC (Remote closed the connection)
[01:06] <J_Milburn> Hah
[01:06] <Ironholds> I'm an active Liberal Democrat, and I'll be an MPs Principle Private Secretary if this general election goes well
[01:06] <Ironholds> if it doesn't I'll be retaining my position of Unpaid Office Gimp, along with Narson
[01:06] * vvv has quit IRC (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out))
[01:06] <J_Milburn> Ah
[01:07] <Ironholds> my political beliefs are always difficult to reconcile with reality, unfortunately
[01:07] <Ironholds> I mean, right. I'm a Liberal Democrat; I believe that people should have a say in decisions that concern them, that the electorate are Britain's sovereign political entity and that government should be directly answerable to the people
[01:07] <Ironholds> unfortunately I've MET the people. Most of them are dicks.
[01:09] <Ironholds> still, that's how life works
[01:09] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: yourself?
[01:11] * JamesC93 has joined #wikipedia-en
[01:11] <Narson> (Note: Ironholds' views do not necessarily represent the views of the party and should be taken as his opinion only.) ;)
[01:11] <J_Milburn> Philosophically, a free-market libertarian with anarchist streaks. In practise? I want us out of Europe, and I want the government to have less power. This translates to votes for UKIP and the Conservatives.
[01:11] <J_Milburn> But I have no alignment to any party at all
[01:12] <J_Milburn> practice, even
[01:12] <Narson> I did like the UKIP leader saying how much he loved the Lib Dems on Daily Politics
[01:12] <Narson> While Ming Campbell started looking very uncomfortable and drastically trying to run away to tell the police where the bad man supported him.
[01:13] <J_Milburn> I'm not a fan of the fact UKIP is now led by a Lord
[01:13] <Narson> (Yes, I know it is Menghis, but I type that and everyone goes 'Who the hell is Menghis?')
[01:13] * MuZemike has joined #wikipedia-en
[01:13] <J_Milburn> Menghis Khanbull, I believe
[01:13] <Narson> Though, even he seems to be using ming these days.
[01:14] <Narson> Oh. He is on Menzies too now.
[01:14] * J_Milburn doubts he is the first to make that joke
[01:14] <Narson> IH: Why does our former leader have so many reported names?
[01:14] * p858snake has joined #wikipedia-en
[01:15] <Ottava> I'm up to 35 well wishers
[01:15] <Ottava> woo
[01:15] <Narson> J_Milburn: Well, I wasn't a member of the party when Campbell was elected.
[01:15] <J_Milburn> I know Tim Farren. He's a Lib Dem MP from up north :)
[01:15] <J_Milburn> He's really nice
[01:15] <Narson> Yeah, nice guy.
[01:15] <Narson> Saw him coming out of a service station toilet once
[01:15] <Narson> Which was funny, as the service station was just a bit south of Oxford
[01:15] <J_Milburn> I've chatted to him a few times
[01:15] <Narson> And we had just left federal conference.
[01:16] <Narson> I've spoken to his staff, not to him really.
[01:16] <J_Milburn> My MP is John Hutton, who's too good to talk to students. So we get Tim Farren instead, as he's next door's MP :)
[01:16] <Narson> Ah, bonus. All our local MPs are total gits.
[01:16] <Narson> We have Brian 'OMG Why Is My Foot In My Mouth Again' Binley
[01:17] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: why out of Europe, if I may ask?
[01:17] <Narson> Sally 'Let Me Help You With Your Penis Mr Brown Gobble Gobble' Keeble.
[01:17] <Ironholds> Narson: Answer: he puts everything in his mouth
[01:17] <Ottava> >.>
[01:17] <Ottava> the brits have very long nick names
[01:17] <Ottava> ;/
[01:17] <Narson> Ironholds: Don't forget my local MP
[01:17] <Narson> Peter 'Sky Sports On The Taxpayer' Bone
[01:17] <Ottava> Sally Brown gives head?
[01:17] <Narson> Wrong Sally
[01:17] <Narson> Sally Brown: Mildly attractive
[01:18] <Ottava> oh wait, Keeble
[01:18] <J_Milburn> Ironholds: I can't abide by another government telling me what I can and can't do, and with us paying them money to give to French farmers, which in turn leads to horrific problems in developing nations
[01:18] <Narson> Sally Keeble: Worst application of the term 'Babe' ever.
[01:18] <Ottava> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Keeble
[01:18] <Ottava> no picture
[01:18] <Ottava> : (
[01:18] <Narson> Ironholds is shit at picture taking
[01:18] <Narson> Or we'd have a pic for that.
[01:18] <Ottava> http://www.sallykeeble.com/
[01:18] <Ottava> Ew, fugly
[01:19] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: another government where we have the largest possible representation? :P
[01:19] <Ottava> Well, for being a Brit, mildly attractive
[01:19] <Ottava> but still
[01:19] <Ottava> fugly
[01:19] <Ottava> : )
[01:19] <Ironholds> and agreed, the CAF needs a massive overhaul
[01:19] <J_Milburn> If you two are fee-paying LibDems, can't you get the Central Lib Demo Powerhouse of Doom to release some pictures?
[01:19] <Narson> Ironholds: Well, we did
[01:19] <Narson> Until the tories joined a fringe group of nutters
[01:19] <Ottava> anyway, Im going to resume watching the Dr Who marathon on BBCA
[01:19] <Ottava> ;/
[01:19] <Ottava> later
[01:19] <Narson> J_Milburn: She is a labour loyalist
[01:19] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: we use a special phrase to refer to the Powerhouse of Doom
[01:19] <Narson> The nearest Liberal Democrat MP is....
[01:19] <Narson> Cambridge?
[01:20] <JSLR>  /o\
[01:20] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: Cowley Street, pissup, brewery, couldn't organise
[01:20] <Narson> Or Oxford.
[01:20] <J_Milburn> My local LibDem candidate is a PE teacher at a failed school
[01:20] <Ironholds> alternately Cowley Street, arse, both hands, couldn't find
[01:20] <J_Milburn> Or was, the school has now closed
[01:20] <Ironholds> Narson: looks like we're going to win OxEast
[01:20] <Narson> Ironholds: We are winning quite a few.
[01:20] <Ironholds> indeed
[01:20] <Narson> We have lost Taunton
[01:20] * p858snake_ has joined #wikipedia-en
[01:20] <Ironholds> are we going to win the olympics?
[01:20] <Ironholds> Never trust anything named after something from the empire strikes back
[01:21] <Narson> (And no, this isn't party secrets, the Taunton guy is Jeremy Browne who decided to appeal his expenses after he got caught being a dick)
[01:21] * Sideards has quit IRC (Remote closed the connection)
[01:21] <Narson> While sitting on a marginal seat
[01:21] <Narson> Against the tories.
[01:21] <Narson> While a Lab->Tor swing was occuring
[01:21] * p858snake has quit IRC (Read error: 113 (No route to host))
[01:22] <J_Milburn> I saw Kennedy on Have I Got News for You the other week. He upped my opinion of the LDs a little
[01:22] <Ironholds> oh, the ginger?
[01:22] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: Aye, Kennedy is always good fun
[01:22] <Narson> I saw Kennedy with a sausage
[01:22] <J_Milburn> He's like your excuse for Boris
[01:22] * p858snake_ has quit IRC (Read error: 54 (Connection reset by peer))
[01:22] <Ironholds> I can tell you that the Lib Dem MPs I've met all honestly want the best for their constituencies
[01:22] * p858snake_ has joined #wikipedia-en
[01:22] <Ironholds> MIlburn: he's better than boris
[01:22] <Narson> Ironholds: We are going to Cumbria
[01:23] <Ironholds> Boris is a pissstained incompetent. Kennedy is a pissed competent.
[01:23] <Narson> Farron has girls.
[01:23] <Ironholds> sorry, are you suggesting we're going to Cumbria to be "entertained" by a sitting MP and his harem?
[01:23] <Ironholds> Sweet
[01:23] <Ironholds> count me in
[01:23] <Narson> Y'know what I like about Farron?
[01:23] <Ironholds> the girls
[01:23] <J_Milburn> What?
[01:23] <Ironholds> the penis?
[01:24] <Narson> He posted his expenses stuff straight on his front page
[01:24] <Ironholds> because he had nothing to hide
[01:24] <Ironholds> rather than cock-gobbler keeble
[01:24] * |ncarnation has joined #wikipedia-en

[01:25] <Ironholds> Narson, did I tell you about her new expenses? Post-08?
[01:25] <Narson> J_Milburn: How is it looking for us in Farron's constituency?
[01:25] <Narson> Ironholds: Yes.
[01:25] <MisterWiki> wb BarkingFish
[01:25] <Ironholds> good good
[01:25] <BarkingFish> thx
[01:25] <Narson> Ah. It is BarkingFish
[01:25] <J_Milburn> Narson: Last year it was a LD/Cons toss-up
[01:25] <J_Milburn> Last election, even
[01:25] <Narson> J_Milburn: Yeah, labour look pretty wiped out there
[01:25] <J_Milburn> I'm not sure now
[01:25] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: for context, Narson's "local" Labour MP claimed for a kitchen extension, window repairs, a new boiler, insurance, telephone costs, the mortgage....
[01:26] <Narson> Not my local
[01:26] <Ironholds> ...a Dora the Explorer DVD from WHS Smith's...
[01:26] <Ironholds> ..sorry, WHAT THE FUCK?
[01:26] <Ironholds> Narson: your local labourite, she is
[01:26] <Ironholds> she's the nearest labour MP to your seat
[01:26] <J_Milburn> Hutton didn't need expenses. He had armed guards check out my college when he payed a visit
[01:26] * Sideards has joined #wikipedia-en
[01:26] <Ironholds> haha
[01:26] <AngryParsley> riddle me this: why does grub have a completely different way of addressing drives than any OS that uses grub?
[01:26] <Narson> That is probably true
[01:26] <J_Milburn> When a guy has armed guards, he doesn't need expenses
[01:26] * coffee NP: Hey Ya! (Radio Mix/Club Mix)' by OutKast (Speakerboxxx / The Love Below)
[01:26] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: If I was defence secretary, that's what I'd do
[01:26] <Narson> J_Milburn: Hopefully Farron will hold it.
[01:27] <Ironholds> take the nearest infantry regiment and rob the bank of england. Fuck expenses
[01:27] <J_Milburn> Actually, next election will be interesting for Barrow and Furness, where I am
[01:27] <J_Milburn> Hutton is retiring
[01:27] <J_Milburn> And so we have a very young Labour candidate
[01:27] <Narson> Oh? I imagine it will be a tory succession
[01:27] <Narson> AFAIK it isn't a target for us
[01:28] <Narson> Maybe a moving forward seat
[01:28] <BarkingFish> i know who my old mp was, but who it is here, i haven't a clue
[01:28] <Narson> BarkingFish: I know who your council is
[01:28] * Rlevse has joined #wikipedia-en
[01:28] <J_Milburn> Narson: We'll get Labour again. The only time we DIDN'T vote Labour was when the Tories were building subs and Labour weren't
[01:28] <J_Milburn> As our entire economy revolves around shipbuilding
[01:29] <Ironholds> BarkingFish: We owwwwwn all your biiins, na na naa naa, na na naa naa, woah oh oh, na na naa naa.
[01:29] <Narson> MPs are split for your area BarkingFish
[01:29] <Ironholds> Lib Dem council ftw
[01:29] <Narson> One Tory, one Labour
[01:29] <BarkingFish> Apparently my mp is mark lancaster
[01:29] <Narson> Ironholds: Acctually, we privatised the bins in MK
[01:29] <Ironholds> oh god, not THAT cock
[01:29] <Narson> And now, for the same money, we have got people weekly bin collections
[01:29] <BarkingFish> N.E Milton Keynes
[01:30] * Incarnation has quit IRC (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out))
[01:30] <Ironholds> he makes me sick
[01:30] <BarkingFish> why?
[01:30] <Narson> BF: Ah, the A509 side?
[01:30] <Ironholds> he's a tory MP who voted against the war and for an investigation and was not asked to pay anything back!
[01:30] * Prodego has joined #wikipedia-en
[01:30] <Ironholds> Transparent bastards like that COMPLETELY cripple our chances of winning anything!
[01:30] <Ironholds> bring in more corrupt wankers!
[01:30] <BarkingFish> ironholds, good for him
[01:30] <Narson> IH: So he is a Liberal Democrat? ;)
[01:30] <MisterWiki> wb Prodego
[01:30] <Ironholds> Narson: tory
[01:30] <MisterWiki> :)
[01:31] <Ironholds> BarkingFish: agreed, I just wish he was one of ours :P. Not big on gay rights, though.
[01:31] <Narson> IH: Nah. Sounds like a Lib Dem to me ;) You'll have to go convince him.
[01:31] <BarkingFish> He has values and stands up for them, and obviously shows his honesty
[01:31] <Narson> Can't be as bad as Bone
[01:31] <AngryParsley> are there any UK politicians who want to legalize guns and get rid of speeding cameras?
[01:31] <Ironholds> Narson: he's a slight bigot, so obviously secretly gay
[01:31] <MisterWiki> Hi AngryParsley
[01:31] <Narson> Hrm.
[01:31] <Ironholds> AngryParsley: no mainstream parties
[01:31] <Ironholds> I'd like to legalize guns for myself
[01:31] <Ironholds> and I'd like a license to kill, at the same sort of time
[01:31] <Narson> Camera removal is wanted by some politicians.
[01:31] <BarkingFish> Yeah, those who hide in the closet are the ones who most ofthen want to get out of them,   ironholds
[01:32] <BarkingFish> S/often
[01:32] <Narson> I'm waiting for Lembit Opik to come out.
[01:32] <AngryParsley> Ironholds: well then you have 38 states to choose from. the other 12 require some sort of need to get a permit besides "hey I want to carry a concealed weapon" :/
[01:32] <BarkingFish> narson: he's clearly bent.
[01:32] <Ironholds> AngryParsley: I would, except then I'd have to put up with Americans
[01:32] <BarkingFish> Why come out when its practically on a sign over his head?

[01:33] <Ironholds> unless this offer comes with a box of .50 and a license to shoot them?
[01:33] <AngryParsley> the entire world has to put up with us. we make all the movies and TV shows :)
[01:33] <Narson> Scandanavian even.
[01:33] <Ironholds> BarkingFish: I believe he's inferring that you're your MP :P
[01:33] <AngryParsley> also we make the news when we bomb stuff

[01:33] <Narson> Ironholds: Lembit Opik, berk.
[01:33] <Narson> I think Norwegian.
[01:33] <Ironholds> Narson: BarkingFish is Lembit Opik?
[01:33] <Narson> No. We were discussing
[01:33] <AngryParsley> the list of decent BBC shows pretty short: top gear
[01:33] <Ironholds> Being Human? QI? Mock the Week? Spaced? Life on Mars?
[01:33] <AngryParsley> *is pretty short
[01:34] <JSLR> Night.
[01:34] <Ironholds> and I didn't say BBC, I said British :p
[01:34] <BarkingFish> Isn 't he the dick who was going out with a cheeky girl, narson?
[01:34] <JSLR> Ironholds, I love of them
[01:34] <Ironholds> Barkingfish: dicks tend to go into cheeky girls, not out with
[01:34] <BarkingFish> Lol
[01:34] <JSLR> And AngryParsley, Top Gear's okay, but nothing compares to QI.
[01:34] <JSLR> Or Mock the Week.
[01:34] <Ironholds> in my experience of bedding cheeky girls

[01:35] <BarkingFish> Ironholds, not really
[01:35] <Ironholds> or, both ends. Right.
[01:35] <BarkingFish> I don't care which one gets worked
[01:35] <Narson> Y'know
[01:35] <Narson> I imagine Milton Keynes is a hot bed for dogging.
[01:35] <AngryParsley> I mean whenever I go to other countries I see ads for US movies or TV shows. the only place I've seen ads for foreign media in the US is hipster places like san francisco
[01:36] <AngryParsley> or the tiny independent theater in downtown san jose
[01:36] <BarkingFish> If you have a socket and a plug, you use them both, right??? :)
[01:36] <BarkingFish> Narson, not necessarily dogging, but we get a lot of cottaging round here
[01:36] <Narson> BarkingFish: Capital
[01:37] <BarkingFish> ?
[01:37] <AngryParsley> it's the one thing the US is good at. it's the equivalent of german automobiles or swiss cuckoo clocks
[01:37] <Narson> BarkingFish: Very good.
[01:37] <BarkingFish> Ah
[01:37] <BarkingFish> Ok

[01:39] <Narson> Ironholds: Allo Allo
[01:39] <Narson> Ironholds: You forgot Allo Allo
[01:39] <AngryParsley> of course not. UK shows have terrible production values compared to US shows. sure the plots and dialogue can be good but it's ruined by the crappy props, camerawork, etc

[01:41] <Ironholds> AngryParsley: oh piss off. If you look at the average UK piece of pisspoor crap, yes, but the same is true of the US. We've got some excellent programs, although not ones that you cultural shutins would get
[01:41] <MisterWiki> http://diegogrezakamisterwiki.wordpress.com/2010/01/02/ironholds-for-administrator/
[01:41] <MisterWiki> that's better
[01:41] <Ironholds> apologies if I don't take cultural advice from a member of a state that considers slapstick the highest form of wit
[01:42] <BarkingFish> I only like 2 people on top gear, richard hammond and james may.  Jeremy clarkson just makes my feckin blood boil. He's an arrogant, self centred cock who should be burned with something very flammable.
[01:42] <Ironholds> MisterWiki: please take that down.
[01:42] <Narson> Ironholds: Well, we don't spend as much per program to be fair.
[01:42] <Ironholds> Narson: true, but can you say Doctor Who is let down by "crappy props and camerawork", for example?
[01:42] <AngryParsley> I can. I can't stand that show
[01:42] <Narson> It was.
[01:42] <Narson> Not since the come back.
[01:42] <Ironholds> Narson: exactly

[01:43] <BarkingFish> Who the fuck would put the centre of all the worlds intelligence and alien knowledge in friggin cardiff????
[01:43] <AngryParsley> the reason production values are lower in the UK is because viewership is lower
[01:43] <MisterWiki> And I'm just startin' it
[01:43] <AngryParsley> you can see it to a greater extent in smaller countries like the netherlands
[01:43] <Sideards> you wouldnt look in cardiff would you
[01:44] <Ironholds> MisterWiki: will you have a horde of dedicated followers in the next five days? No. Probably best to take it down.
[01:44] <Ironholds> BarkingFish: well, you have to admit

[01:44] <Sideards> production values huh
[01:44] <Ironholds> if you were looking for it, you wouldn't go there,w ould you?
[01:44] <Ironholds> genius
[01:44] <BarkingFish> Sideards: not only wouldn't i look there, i wouldn't GO there
[01:44] <Ironholds> BarkingFish: me, y'mean

[01:44] <BarkingFish> I'd rather be circumcised with lawn shears
[01:44] <Ironholds> dammit Sideards, being faster than me
[01:44] <AngryParsley> with a population of only 16 million, you can't support the same quality of shows as with a population of 300 million
[01:45] <Ironholds> AngryParsley: Our population is 60 million you ignorant shut-in
[01:45] <AngryParsley> Ironholds: the population of the netherlands is 16 million
[01:45] <Ironholds> oh, right
[01:45] <AngryParsley> Ironholds: I was born in the UK
[01:45] <Ironholds> srsly? Greater London is 12

[01:45] <Sideards> we have better things to do with our time than watch telly all the time
[01:45] <Majorly> not four

[01:45] <Narson> Majorly: 6 ;)
[01:45] <Ironholds> Majorly; withdraw your libelous comment, plz :P
[01:45] <Narson> Rome was quite good
[01:45] <Narson> And band of brothers.
[01:45] <MuZemike> But then again, 95% of all American TV programs are cheap reality shows.
[01:45] <AngryParsley> also since english is the most popular second language, english-language shows can be distributed outside their home countries
[01:45] <Sideards> american shows are all so false and plastic

[01:46] <Narson> And an HBO/BBC project
[01:46] <Sideards> countries dont share the best telly anyow
[01:47] <Ironholds> Sideards: the americans keep insisting on remaking ours
[01:47] <BarkingFish> the best bbc collaboration i've seen these last 2 years was, without a shadow, merlin.
[01:47] <Narson> Oh god. The American Office
[01:47] <Sideards> does a set have to cost millions to make the show good
[01:47] <Ironholds> Spaced, Life on Mars and Red Dwarf stand out as examples of things which the Americans just didn't get
[01:47] <Sideards> or is it about good storylines and scripting
[01:47] <Ironholds> Sideards: Depends if you ask Peter Jackson or not
[01:47] <Narson> IH: You know what is a bad example of our expensive shows going wrong? Robin Hood
[01:47] <BarkingFish> Yeah
[01:47] <Narson> First season. Ok. Fine.
[01:47] <Narson> Second season? It starts with guys in berets and leather dusters
[01:47] <Sideards> life on mars was ruined by american version
[01:48] <Sideards> they just didnt get the whole ethos
[01:48] <BarkingFish> merlin though in both series, had me chairbound.
[01:48] <Narson> I mean, I can live with some historical silliness, but early 20th century military gear?
[01:48] <AngryParsley> notice that out of the $125 million budget for band of brothers, the BBC spent $10 million. dreamworks, playtone, and HBO paid the rest
[01:48] <BarkingFish> i even turned my phones off so no fckr could disturb me
[01:48] <MuZemike> Merlin wasn't too bad (at least the American version, which was the only series I watched)
[01:48] <Narson> Why not just have Robin Hood use a damn AK
[01:48] <Ironholds> AngryParsley: we didn't pay for most of CERN either. Obviously science is dead in the UK
[01:48] <Sideards> hell yeah i would watch that lol
[01:49] <Narson> AngryParsley: I imagine there was also the use of BBC Worldwide.
[01:49] <Sideards> science is NOT dead in the uk
[01:49] <Sideards> check out scientists journals
[01:49] <BarkingFish> Muzemike, the latest series we got here, was a collaboration between bbc and duna tv, hungary, and it was feckin brilliant. Beat the crud out of anything i've tried to watch, cranford, etc...
[01:49] <Sideards> we get the ideas then take em where the funding is
[01:50] * pradalvr has joined #wikipedia-en

[01:50] <Sideards> is monty python crap koz they made it on no money
[01:50] <AngryParsley> Ironholds: I'm just pointing out that band of brothers had an american director, american actors, >90% american producers and american writers
[01:51] <Narson> I'm sorry.
[01:51] <Narson> Simon Pegg
[01:51] <Ironholds> AngryParsley: works for me, I never claimed it was ours
[01:51] <Narson> He was blatantly in Band of Brothers for 2 minutes
[01:51] <AngryParsley> haha
[01:51] <Ironholds> but you can't go "you've got less money than us, you didn't invest as much, therefore your contribution to stuff is obvious pap"

[01:52] <AngryParsley> from the star trek movie
[01:52] <BarkingFish> j_milburn: wtf?
[01:52] <MuZemike> Tom Hanks did a good job directing that series (of course, he also helped with Steven Spielberg in directing Saving Private Ryan, which is what the series is very similar to as far as cinematography is concerned)

[01:54] <Saryn> Americans landed to the south, and the Brits/Canadians were up north on cool bikes
[01:54] <Narson> Saryn: Well, we commanded it.
[01:55] <Narson> And we landed south east, americans landed to the north west of us.

[01:56] <MuZemike> LOL, there was even a one-star general who got killed after being careless in a Glider.
[01:56] <Sideards> the best things come from no money
[01:56] <Narson> Muzemike: Command of the landings in general fell to Monty
[01:56] <MuZemike> They actually show that in Saving Private Ryan, and it's referenced in the Band of Brothers novel.
[01:57] <Saryn> Wasn't Monty also responsible for Market Garden?
[01:57] <MuZemike> Yes, Monty was in command of Market Garden.
[01:57] <Narson> Muzemike: I just like that Richard Todd was in The Longest Day
[01:57] <Ironholds> *cough* fuckup *cough*
[01:57] <Narson> As his own commanding officer
[01:57] <MuZemike> And I believe the Sicily campaign.

[02:20] <Sideards> i dont know what 'digger' is
[02:21] <Sideards> my dad claims to have been friends with the composer of popcorn

[02:28] <Sideards> shame he isnt here to see that then lol
[02:28] <Narson> Which used to be a city.
[02:28] <Shirik> what happened to Ironholds' RFA?

[02:33] <JamesC93> Who'll create the thread?
[02:33] <Shirik> I think you just did
[02:34] <[Soap]> Well, that's too bad. I had hoped he would stay in until the end
[02:34] <Narson> Soap: Me too. He needs to let it run its course.
[02:34] <BarkingFish> what was his final tally?
[02:34] <Narson> But it was rather clear some of the opposes were bad faith.
[02:34] <[Soap]> the final tally was 64/38/11
[02:34] <Shirik> Sideards: we were discussing potential adminship of a user
[02:34] <Narson> One of those 11 is a support, Soap
[02:34] <Narson> Someone put their comment in the wrong section
[02:35] <Sideards> aha so u guys are like admins on wikipedia
[02:35] <Narson> Nope
[02:35] <Narson> I'm just a long term pain in the neck.
[02:35] <Shirik> haha
[02:35] <BarkingFish> Yeah, but that more than 50% oppose to support, he wouldn't have got thru with that, surely
[02:37] <Narson> I think they say 66% is the minimum for the discretion
[02:37] <BarkingFish> yeah...
[02:37] <[Soap]> no, it's definitely at least 70
[02:37] <BarkingFish> I mean my first and only rfa dropped like a skip on a car
[02:37] <[Soap]> there have been promotions of RfA's closing in the 60s but they were due to various scenarios that dont apply to general cases
[02:38] <Prodego> 75-80
[02:38] <Narson> I'd probably get...10% support?
[02:38] <BarkingFish> I was like 6 to 1 against
[02:38] <BarkingFish> The problem with rfa is that people keep moving the goalposts
[02:39] * BasketOfPuppies has joined #wikipedia-en
[02:39] <BarkingFish> when i first joined, upwards of a thousand edits was fine
[02:39] <Sideards> so why the competition to admin this particular user?
[02:39] <Narson> It is probably more of a vote than anything else on wiki
[02:39] <Shirik> hi BasketOfPuppies!
[02:39] <BarkingFish> i've got aiming for 5k now and still been told i'd most likely fail
[02:39] <Narson> So people just toss anything in as their reason
[02:39] <Narson> I think I'm on 4K edits or something
[02:40] <Narson> Ah. 4851
[02:40] <BarkingFish> the problem is with my intermittent net access, i can't always get on when i'd like
[02:40] <Shirik> I have over 5k, and I know I'd fail
[02:40] <Shirik> then again, I sorta cheated

[02:41] <Narson> I'm much the same Barking Fish
[02:41] <BarkingFish> Through vandal fighting, csd, etc
[02:41] <Narson> Oh, I don't get involved in CSD
[02:41] <Narson> I prefer AFD, where there is more of a reasoned debate.
[02:41] <Shirik> If I had to estimate, I'd say 80% of my edits are vandal fighting and 10% are CSDs
[02:42] <MuZemike> Narson: Bollocks
[02:42] <Shirik> which leaves me with what, 500 content edits?
[02:42] <Narson> Muzemike: In theory. ;) Bearing in mind that an admin can ignore morons at will
[02:42] <MuZemike> It's either "Keep -- [insert ideaology here]" or "Delete -- not notable"
[02:42] <Crimedog> Hello
[02:42] <BarkingFish> shirik, i'd say mine is about 30% csd, 40% vandal, 20% article and 10% userspace
[02:43] <MuZemike> Speak o' the devil.
[02:43] <Shirik> MuZemike, lol
[02:43] <Crimedog> Am I the devil being spoken about?
[02:44] <BarkingFish> i've imported a coupla articles from other wikis, and i don't just edit on en.  In total i'd say, xwiki, i have about 7500 edits
[02:44] <MuZemike> Yeah, you happened to walk in whilst talking about AFDs. :)

[03:40] <[Soap]> well I invite you both to go to that page and explain that, then
[03:40] <BasketOfPuppies> [Soap], but this RfC is specific to the Audit Subcommittee
[03:41] <BasketOfPuppies> [Soap], i figured start with something small and rather minor
[03:41] <[Soap]> ok
[03:41] <BasketOfPuppies> [Soap], gain consensus on it and then move to bigger things

[03:59] <BasketOfPuppies> MissAlyx|, i see a TON of that on NPP
[03:59] <Shirik> Yeah
[03:59] <MissAlyx|> teres characters dotted around like #'s and stuff
[03:59] <Shirik> there's no CSD for "looks like crap"

[04:01] <Shirik> MissAlyx|: That doesn't apply to thsi
[04:01] <MissAlyx|> it has no content at all, the whole article is just a paste..
[04:01] <MissAlyx|> Shirik: really?
[04:01] <MissAlyx|> why not?
[04:01] <Shirik> "no indication of importance" under A7 only applies to people, bands, organizations,
[04:01] <Shirik> um
[04:01] <Shirik> websites
[04:01] <BasketOfPuppies> companies
[04:01] <Shirik> I have to go look up the rest

[04:02] <Shirik> Note that CSD is a very strict set of rules. If it doesn't meet CSD, that doesn't mean it's fit for inclusion, it just means there needs to be discussion.

[04:10] <Shirik> It is
[04:10] <Shirik> There's a ton of random independent people making addons
[04:11] <Shirik> But while I have released one or two random things, I'm not really in that boat
[04:11] <Shirik> to answer the question directly, my mask comes from a website on which I am staff
[04:11] <Netalarm> lol. right to the point

[04:13] <Shirik> If you want something more direct - it's not my profession :P I'm a software engineer for a UAV company

[04:13] <Netalarm> please make sure none of them crash into my house =D
[04:13] <Shirik> haha
[04:14] <[Soap]> cool
[04:14] <Shirik> Well don't worry, the FAA has done a very good job of not letting us do anything
[04:14] <Shirik> We found this like 50 mile radius area where there's nothing
[04:14] <Shirik> asked them for the rights to it
[04:14] <Shirik> they gave us like 1 mile right in the center
[04:14] <Shirik> it's a desert and they're worried about it -_-
[04:15] <Netalarm> lol
[04:15] <kylu> they should give you a mile centered upon the equator, to see if the UAV needlessly flips over after it crosses the line
[04:15] <Netalarm> the idea of having planes with no pilots around the US isn't exactly comforting
[04:15] * Warrior4321 has quit IRC (No route to host)
[04:15] <kylu> then again, that wouldn't really be within the FAA's remit.
[04:15] <Shirik> actually, Netalarm, I'm more scared of pilots than computers now
[04:15] <Shirik> I mean, I'm biased, I'm on the flight controls team
[04:16] <Shirik> which includes autopilot, etc.
[04:16] * Netalarm isnt afraid of computers!
[04:16] <Shirik> but really the chances of a computer making a mistake are drastically lower than that of a person, imo
[04:16] <Shirik> (assuming it is coded right)
[04:17] <Netalarm> computers dont make mistakes
[04:17] <Netalarm> it only does what its coded to do.
[04:17] <Shirik> until something breaks :P
[04:17] <Netalarm> lol
[04:17] <Shirik> but I mean, using that logic
[04:17] <Shirik> what makes you think all the computers in a 787 are stable?
[04:17] * Not_the_NSA has joined #wikipedia-en
[04:18] <Shirik> Assuming the same QA guidelines are used between a 787 and a UAV, then surely they'd be just as safe?
[04:18] * pradalvr has quit IRC ("ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.5.6/20091201220228]")
[04:18] <Netalarm> just the fact that there's a pilot in control makes people feel safer
[04:18] <Netalarm> a pilot will do everything he can to save his life
[04:18] <Shirik> and that's why we'll never have unmanned passenger planes :)
[04:18] <Netalarm> but a computer...?
[04:18] <BasketOfPuppies> Shirik, what happens if the UAV develops a mind of its own and attack its human makers?
[04:18] <Netalarm> BasketOfPuppies: too many movies =]
[04:18] <Shirik> BasketOfPuppies: You should be worried about CollabRCBot getting a mind of his own and attacking wikipedia
[04:19] <BasketOfPuppies> Shirik, there is a giant UNDO button for that
[04:19] <Shirik> he's faster than you!

[04:23] <MissAlyx|> use truecrypt :/
[04:23] <MissAlyx|> i encrypted my 1tb in .. minutes xD
[04:23] <Shirik> now the real question: Is it actually well encrypted :)
[04:23] <MissAlyx|> very well encrypted :<
[04:23] <Shirik> know the technology?

[04:24] <MissAlyx|> enough to deter the average investigator :P
[04:24] <Shirik> MuZemike: What did you do now!
[04:24] <MuZemike> Shitload of deletions.
[04:24] <Netalarm> MissAlyx|: I only use TrueCrypt on unencrypted drives
[04:24] <MuZemike> ...since I've been lax on patrolling CSD as of late
[04:24] <Netalarm> cause it only creates containers
[04:25] <Shirik> do people really get mad at you for that?
[04:25] <Netalarm> i wonder what my school dean would do if he found my truecrypt container
[04:25] <Netalarm> cause i can deny that its even encrypted =D

[04:26] <MissAlyx|> and one plug socket that turns off everything, incase i get raided or anything..
[04:26] <Netalarm> MissAlyx|: illegal stuff? =D
[04:26] <MissAlyx|> once the two internal drives and 1 external drive gets powered down, you need the password again :P
[04:26] <MissAlyx|> Netalarm: sorta, well, maybe
[04:26] <MuZemike> Uh-oh, I think I broke the wiki.
[04:27] <Netalarm> the only thing i have that is defenitely illegel are the pirated songs
[04:27] <Shirik> lol MuZemike, did you tell him where the logs were?
[04:27] <MissAlyx|> well, i have more that that ¬_¬

[04:29] <Netalarm> cause i cant bitlocker my c: drive xP
[04:30] <MissAlyx|> my system drive is encrypted too, so yes :P
[04:30] <AngryParsley> use truecrypt
[04:30] <AngryParsley> problem solved
[04:30] <MuZemike> Here's an example of his (now-deleted work) [[Alan Keith of Genentech]]: "A worker of Genentech Inc., Alan Keith said: "Leadership is ultimately about creating a way for people to contribute to making something extraordinary happen." Information about Genentech:"
[04:30] <MuZemike> Reference was to another WP page.
[04:30] <MissAlyx|> truecrypt can encrypt the system drive
[04:30] <MissAlyx|> http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=system-encryption << info there
[04:30] <Netalarm> so it would need a startup password?
[04:30] <MuZemike> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Asdfghjkl1234567891012345678910uhf
[04:30] <AngryParsley> yes
[04:30] <MissAlyx|> yes
[04:31] <AngryParsley> other solution: get a mac, use filevault
[04:31] <MissAlyx|> and even then, you need to know the other passwords to get into the external drives

[04:31] <MissAlyx|> theres 3 passwords between you and my private material that nobody can ever see :P
[04:31] <PeterSymonds> Jolly good show.
[04:31] <AngryParsley> other solution: install ubuntu, enable encrypted home directory, spend hours trying to get youtube videos to play smoothly
[04:31] <MuZemike> per that one guy's contribs: L3-warning? L4-warning? Banhammer?
[04:31] <Rjd0060> lolbrit
[04:31] <PeterSymonds> :P
[04:32] <Netalarm> does TrueCrypt require that TPM chip thing?
[04:32] <AngryParsley> Netalarm: no
[04:32] <Netalarm> cause i dont have that... and BitLocker requires it
[04:32] <AngryParsley> number of passwords doesn't matter very much. the encryption method and the length and randomness of the password matter
[04:32] <MissAlyx|> AngryParsley: i know, but im worried they might get through the first one
[04:32] <MuZemike> L3-warning for vandalism it is.
[04:32] <MissAlyx|> and if they do, they'd have all the files
[04:32] <MissAlyx|> and if a court says i NEED to decrypt it, too..
[04:32] * LaraLove has joined #wikipedia-en
[04:32] <Netalarm> what happens if you dont?
[04:33] <MissAlyx|> because the externals are where the super-private stuff is kept, they have 2 encryptions.. so im happy to give them the 1st password if they say i need to :P
[04:33] <AngryParsley> Netalarm: depends on the country and the law. in the US they have to have seen you doing bad things with your computer beforehand
[04:33] <MuZemike> Argh, who keeps tagging articles for speedy deletion?
[04:33] <MissAlyx|> and once theyve done that, theres no evidence theres another
[04:33] <AngryParsley> MissAlyx|: are you using a truecrypt hidden disk image?
[04:33] * Cyrius has joined #wikipedia-en
[04:33] <MissAlyx|> even though i know there is :P
[04:33] <Netalarm> MuZemike: I shall tag myself for deletion
[04:33] <MissAlyx|> AngryParsley: i have no idea what that means
[04:33] <MissAlyx|> i encrypted my entire system drive, and 2 other drives
[04:34] <Netalarm> MissAlyx|: a "decoy" false password
[04:34] <Netalarm> the hidden volume
[04:34] <MissAlyx|> oh, yes, that
[04:34] <MissAlyx|> hidden volume :P
[04:34] <MissAlyx|> should have just said hidden volume ¬_¬
[04:34] <AngryParsley> deniable encryption. enter one password and you get harmless files. enter another and you get super secret files
[04:34] <MissAlyx|> yeah :P
[04:34] <Netalarm> i dont have anything that sensitive
[04:34] <MissAlyx|> i do ¬_¬
[04:34] * MuZemike sees how many pages he's deleted the past hour
[04:34] <MissAlyx|> makes you wonder what it is, doesnt it :P?
[04:35] <Netalarm> you work for the chinese intelligeence service?
[04:35] <Netalarm> lol
[04:35] <MissAlyx|> what could possibly be so secret that i want to hide!
[04:35] <MuZemike> About 60 pages.
[04:35] <AngryParsley> Netalarm: I keep my diary in a truecrypt volume. that way I know my thoughts can only be read by me
[04:36] <Netalarm> sensitive information to me, it seems that they are only sensitive if they are in the hands of speccific people
[04:36] <Netalarm> i can keep information on say, AngryParsley  that he would be mad if he found out
[04:36] <Netalarm> but in the hands of MissAlyx| , that information would NOT be sensitive
[04:36] <AngryParsley> also truecrypt is cross-platform, so it's handier than OS-specific stuff
[04:36] <MissAlyx|> well, i wouldnt want the police getting hold of my hard drives... :P
[04:36] <MissAlyx|> because they'd try and accuse me of all sorts..

[04:37] <MissAlyx|> no, its not :/
[04:38] <MissAlyx|> just in general, theres lots i wouldnt want them to see :/
[04:38] <AngryParsley> are you worried about owning copies of certain controversial books or papers?
[04:38] * Mattisse has joined #wikipedia-en
[04:38] <MissAlyx|> files, videos, logs

[04:38] <AngryParsley> because anyone who reads will have a bookshelf of controversial books

[04:39] <MissAlyx|> lol, no, they wouldnt be bothered about that anyway
[04:39] <AngryParsley> I have a copy of the quran and some chemistry books but that doesn't make me a terrorist. I don't have a bible around though
[04:39] <MissAlyx|> i refuse to read any religious book ¬_¬
[04:39] <MissAlyx|> unless its about how religion is a load of ass.

[04:40] <AngryParsley> they're culture dumps from 2,000 years ago. it's interesting to see how far we progressed
[04:40] <Netalarm> MissAlyx|: then i cant really think of whats so sensitive... maybe you're just paranoid -.-
[04:40] <AngryParsley> sure it's religious mumbo jumbo but it's stuff written by people from a long time ago
[04:40] <AngryParsley> I also have stuff like gilgamesh, the illiad, the aeneid, etc
[04:41] <Netalarm> AngryParsley: I have around 100 classics in eBook format on my computer
[04:41] <AngryParsley> yeah but have you read them?
[04:42] <AngryParsley> from an information theoretic perspective, the book might as well not exist until you pick it up and read it :P
[04:42] <Netalarm> nope...
[04:42] <Netalarm> i dont have time
[04:42] <AngryParsley> from a social signaling perspective though, the book attains full value as soon as you have it sitting on a shelf :P

[04:48] <AngryParsley> umm
[04:48] <Dragonfly6-7> MissAlyx| - religion books are fascinating in terms of cultural history
[04:48] <AngryParsley> it doesn't matter where the drive is
[04:48] <Netalarm> meh...
[04:48] <Netalarm> then i'd need to backitup
[04:49] <Netalarm> but that would be to an uncrypted drive
[04:49] <AngryParsley> Netalarm: people think "ooh encryption, good!" but the costs often outweigh the benefits for most data
[04:49] <MissAlyx|> yeah, right, im off to bed :P
[04:49] <AngryParsley> MissAlyx|: if christianity wasn't popular today, the bible would still be a useful book simply because of how it reflects human cultures from long ago

[04:55] <AngryParsley> my home server is 4.5TB
[04:55] <quanticle> AngryParsley: Yeah, that they were really too interested in the minute details of individual battles.  I mean, really, did I want to know that the spear of so-and-so entered through the back of the head and cut out the other person's tongue?  No, I didn't.
[04:55] <Shirik> imo, with all the planes getting wireless internet, I don't even think it's a big deal anymore :P
[04:55] <AngryParsley> haha
[04:55] <Shirik> I have literally reverted vandalism at FL300
[04:55] <quanticle> Shirik: FL300?

[04:56] <Shirik> the airplane had wireless internet
[04:56] <Shirik> Delta does that in a lot of their planes now
[04:56] <Shirik> I assume it's satellite based
[04:57] <AngryParsley> that means higher latency

[05:06] <MuZemike> Of course, I still remember when Britney Spears hit it big. She was the first major entertainment star in which I was actually older than.
[05:06] <Ionas_Freeman> I am now checking for links to this article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer
[05:07] <Ionas_Freeman> which, while not completely useless, was being spammed around everywhere, in places where it does not belong.
[05:07] <Ottava> MuZemike - younger means more wild
[05:07] <Ottava> no?
[05:07] <Ottava> I like David Tennant
[05:07] * MuZemike is 13 days older than Britney Spears to be exact
[05:07] <Ottava> I wish he wouldnt have left : (

[05:08] <Ottava> I just like David Tennant
[05:08] <Ottava> screw the doctor
[05:08] <Ottava> : )
[05:09] <MuZemike> In fact, he's probably my next favorite Doctor (my favorite still being the Second Doctor).
[05:09] <Ottava> The Second? not the one with the scarf?
[05:09] <Ottava> number 4 I think
[05:09] <MuZemike> Tom Baker is pretty good, too.
[05:09] <Ottava> Haha, Tennant was Barty Crouch, Jr.
[05:09] <Ottava> haha
[05:10] <MuZemike> But there's some appeal and "bumblingness" that Patrick Troughton had; actually some of those same traits I found in Tennant.

[05:12] <Ottava> I dont remember episodes - it was just on PBS when I was younger
[05:13] <MuZemike> Right. I think all they showed was the Fourth Doctor onward.
[05:13] <MuZemike> PBS showed the *entire* adventure, not just parts of them.
[05:13] <MuZemike> *at one time

[05:16] <Ionas_Freeman> "In fact, gay-male identified women are a type of queer gender identity. "

[05:19] <Ionas_Freeman> This is nonsense that has very little to do with the article. It appears in text within parentheses, which explains that the title of one of the band's albums is a pun, a play on a common error stating that some German word can only be used to describe males.

[05:48] <kylu> Ionas: that's an argument by assertion, you're not providing proof nor citation to a rule that proves your point.
[05:49] <Ionas_Freeman> OK, that is true, but it definitely needs to be improved. For example, here is useful content:
[05:49] <Ionas_Freeman> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_intervention_in_Angola
[05:49] <Ionas_Freeman> Compare this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girlfags_and_guydykes

[05:51] <kylu> I don't think it can be said that you have a neutral view on the subject if your first reaction is to delete it as nonsense. It may be a good idea to ignore the articles and let someone else take care of them.
[05:51] <kylu> Last I checked, we have some time before the publication deadline just yet.
[05:52] <Ionas_Freeman> I would not delete it before nominating it and establishing consensus, and if the consensus was "Keep" by the time it was done, then I would begin to improve it and I would not delete it. That is, if I were an administrator.
[05:53] <kylu> how would you imagine you'd go about rewriting it, then?
[05:53] <kylu> more specifically, come up with a lead line, recalling WP:NPOV.
[05:54] <Ionas_Freeman> I don't have a "neutral view" on the topic. However,  it would be more appropriate for me to edit the article than Benjiboi, who has a conflict of interest and has very little justification for not being banned yet. I will not waste my time on digging up the facts, but he certainly has a COI.

[05:56] <kylu> digging up facts on wikipedians is not desired behavior, by the way.

[05:59] <Ionas_Freeman> While it has little relevance right now, I can't help but address this. When a wiki bigshot like Benjiboi has his COI revealed, it's considered "outing", and when some newbie who knows nothing of the rules does it, it is a COI violation and spamming. I am not saying that it is unjustified to notice COI on the part of a new user, just that equal standards should apply.
[05:59] <Ottava> Benjiboi is not a Wiki bigshot

[06:01] * Thorncrag_ is now known as Thorncrag
[06:01] <Ionas_Freeman> In reference to the articles, I would say "(term) is a term used by some (queer activists|in the field of gender studies|transsexuals) to refer to a person who (is|feels that|etc)..."
[06:01] <kylu> coi is usually used to prevent [[User:John Smith]] from editing [[John Smith]] or [[The We Hate John Smith Company]], a Frenchman is allowed to edit [[France]], and there's no rule preventing a gay man from editing [[Homosexuality]].
[06:02] <kylu> rather than the age of the contributor, it's more the specificity of the article versus the editor.
[06:03] <kylu> in the case of Benjiboi, you could assume that this person is aligned differently from you, sure, but putting his name and address on the web (say, Brandt's little site) would be a good example of outing.
[06:03] <kylu> if you're unsure as to the difference, I'd suggest doing nothing approaching either.
[06:04] <Ionas_Freeman> This has nothing to do with any of those, and I never mentioned age. For more than a year and possibly two, this man had two autobiographies and continued to have his way until someone nominated them for AFD. They were deleted despite his insistence on being evasive with regard to the questions "Are the subjects of these articles one and the same?" and "If so, are they you?".
[06:05] * BasketOfPuppies has accomplished her goal
[06:05] <Ionas_Freeman> "Outing" is a different subject altogether, but one which is also overdramatized. He isn't "aligned" differently from me, and our politics are actually more similar than you may think.
[06:05] <kylu> I didn't care about the specifics, honestly.
[06:05] <BasketOfPuppies> I got 4k edits in exactly my first year of editing, 2 GAs and 2 failed RfAs
[06:05] <Dragonfly6-7> CoI => "a person who directly benefits from subject X having an article is not the best person to judge whether subject X meets inclusion criteria"
[06:05] <Ionas_Freeman> Unless you mean sexuality, or Dungeons & Dragons, or something.
[06:06] <Ionas_Freeman> Dragonfly6-7: That, in its narrowest definition, includes autobiographies by established users.
[06:06] <kylu> BasketOfPuppies: I've never heard of someone who had a goal of failing RFA, but congratulations for achieving such.
[06:06] <Ionas_Freeman> Their less-than-benevolent intentions are revealed if they are evasive when asked if it is an autobiographical piece.
[06:06] <kylu> Ionas: I'd agree with you in that case, but the method of resolving it is the contentious point, I think.
[06:07] <BasketOfPuppies> kylu, it wasn't a goal, jsut a fact
[06:07] <kylu> rather than putting their personal information on the web or some talkpage, I'd suggest sending your concerns to arbcom for investigation instead.
[06:07] <Ionas_Freeman> I never put anyone's personal information up that didn't put theirs up first.
[06:08] <Ionas_Freeman> Benjiboi (and David Shankbone) put Benjiboi's personal information on the web.
[06:08] <kylu> it shouldn't be done at all.
[06:08] <Ionas_Freeman> Never once did I mention his name, here or elsewhere.

[08:56] <NotAPuff> I would try to contact him.
[08:56] <BasketOfPuppies> MBisanz, any chance we can discuss this?

[11:12] <MuZemike> It's interesting. I brought up a meta-discussion on wikien-l-request@lists.wikimedia.org , basically complaining that everyone is trying to watch the entire encyclopedia
[11:13] <Daedalus969> about the admin:article ratio?
[11:13] <MuZemike> Basically, I was arguing that some people were using watchlists to [[WP:OWN]] articles in a de facto manner.
[11:13] <Daedalus969> oh
[11:13] <MuZemike> idk if this is related, but I feel I should bring it up
[11:14] <MuZemike> I have forgotten that there is A LOT of articles out there, though.
[11:15] <Ironholds> Deadalus: the ratio is 1.5,000:3 million :p
[11:15] <MuZemike> However, it is human nature to watch some articles more than others (like [[Barack Obama]] for instance)
[11:15] * NotAPuff has joined #wikipedia-en
[11:16] <MuZemike> The entire encyclopedia doesn't need to be watched; obviously some will immediately yell BLP, and that's fine.
[11:16] <MuZemike> BLPs are still a small portion of the encyclopedia.
[11:17] <Ironholds> MuZemike: indeed
[11:17] <Ironholds> when we consider we'd had maybe a dozen publicly-reported BLP problems since 05, we're doing pretty well

[12:33] <Ironholds> but to narrow it down a bit - Uffie, Justice, Lady GaGa, Pure Reason Revolution, Mew and Propoghandi

[12:38] <Gracenotes> Ironholds: I'm sort of in a period of listening to one or two catchy songs from a given artist, ambivalent about taking the effort to download their stuff >_>
[12:38] <Gracenotes> Ladytron, Dragonette, The Strokes, Broken Social Scene, a few bands I'm experimenting with, so to speak
[12:38] <Ironholds> ahh, fair enough
[12:38] <Ironholds> good choices all around
[12:39] <Ironholds> in that sort of area I'm into Metric, Tegan and Sara, Tilly and the Wall and Modest Mouse at the moment
[12:39] * [Pmlineditor] is now known as PM|AFK

[12:40] <Gracenotes> I honestly don't care too much about how obscure or popular a band is, but I might be a bit allergic to pop-popular
[12:41] <Ironholds> haha
[12:41] <Ironholds> NMH and Of Montreal are wonderful
[12:41] <Ironholds> from that sort of "scene" - the Apples in Stereo?
[12:42] <Gracenotes> I get the feeling that I haven't heard of most bands, compared to most people, or about the music scenes/band associations they belong to
[12:42] <Ironholds> ahh
[12:43] <Ironholds> well NMH was part of the "Elephant 6" scene; a group of bands around a label that basically swapped members for various projects
[12:43] <Ironholds> The Apples in Stereo are another band from the collective
[12:44] <Gracenotes> Apples in Stereo sounds ridiculously happy-sounding, heh

[12:55] <geniice> It would probably be posible to make a totaly awesome wikipedia browser if anyone really cared
[12:55] <Gracenotes> true. It might have to do with multiple instances of a flash player.
[12:55] <Gracenotes> and chrome supporting that kind of thing as a design goal
[12:56] * Narodnik has joined #wikipedia-en
[12:56] <Gracenotes> geniice: well. I find it hard to browse Wikipedia without browsing the things it links to, no?
[12:56] <geniice> it varies
[12:57] <Gracenotes> in the good firefox news side of things, I've found Tree Style Tab a pretty neat extension. Helps me browse much more logically.
[12:57] <geniice> but you could certianly put together a browser with very solid support for are .ogg formats
[12:57] <Gracenotes> It might be a tad unstable (that might just be Firefox in general), but I can handle a tad.
[12:58] <Gracenotes> there is some overhead in organizing a tree, which I gladly pay for
[12:58] <geniice> for example:
[12:58] <geniice> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Viscosity_video_science_museum.ogv
[12:58] <geniice> how well does that play in chrome?
[12:58] * closedmouth|away is now known as closedmouth|mst
[12:58] <Shirik> seems to play fine
[12:59] <Gracenotes> it *plays* in Firefox, although a bit choppy, and actually does play fine in Chrome once it loads
[12:59] <Gracenotes> but I think both of them are using some plugin, maybe to totem
[13:00] <geniice> nope
[13:00] <geniice> firefox has native support for that format
[13:04] <Gracenotes> hm
[13:04] <Gracenotes> how native? it uses some ffmpeg-like library, right?

[14:05] <Daedalus969> then when it reached a usable state, I copied it onto wikipedia
[14:05] <Daedalus969> from there I altered the coding for increased customizability
[14:06] <Daedalus969> trying to figure out how to get a transparent image to stretch was my first concern
[14:06] <Daedalus969> I then figured out I could replace the transparent image with a solid color of a background of a table

[14:20] <Ironholds> and the UK, if some politicians get their way
[14:20] <slakr> ireland just passed a law forbidding blasphemy
[14:20] <Daedalus969> and finally, the third table displays the 'progress' part of the thermometer

[14:24] <geniice> indeed but then mostly failed to enforce it for several decades suggests a lack of effort

[14:25] <slakr> it doesn't really matter what's in the constitution

[16:14] <Aqwis> I had no idea, Ironholds
[16:14] <J_Milburn> Not one to judge, but...
[16:14] <Aqwis> you did an RfA while I was away?!
[16:14] <Aqwis> dammit

[16:15] <J_Milburn> "The path of the admin is a dark one, it's the one where you give up all the good things that you do, a little at a time, and find yourself mired down in a bureaucracy perpetuated by the biggest group of moronic jackasses that have ever been assembled." - Think he's just bigging himself up, ironically
[16:15] <J_Milburn> "Look how amazing I am- I handle all this, but have not been converted to the dark side"
[16:15] <Ironholds> Aqwis: ehh, I failed horribly
[16:15] * Bjelleklang has joined #wikipedia-en
[16:15] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: I'm more confused by his statement that I perpetuate the bearaucracy
[16:15] <Aqwis> no matter! you would have failed a little less horribly had I been there to vote
[16:15] <Ironholds> I make no edits to ANI, AIV or anything else
[16:16] <Ironholds> in fact, the only place I've worked that's at all paperwork-y is Special:NewPages
[16:16] <Ironholds> ...where I cleared 30 days of said paperwork :S
[16:16] <geniice> J_Milburn So I should block him with the reason "bypassing bureaucracy to block a dick"?
[16:16] <Ironholds> Aqwis: were you around for my new years stunt?
[16:16] <Aqwis> nope
[16:16] <Ironholds> geniice: na, block per "blocking a moronic jackass"
[16:16] <J_Milburn> geniice: Do that, and I'll reblock him when he's unblocked :)
[16:17] <Ironholds> Aqwis: you know the Special:NewPages thing has a 30-day backlog, permanently?
[16:17] <Aqwis> yes
[16:17] <Ironholds> Aqwis: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:New_years_day.jpg.
[16:17] <Aqwis> that's nice
[16:17] <Ironholds> I cleared the entire thing in less than a week. The final push was seven days, staying up until the early hours of new years eve
[16:17] <Ironholds> even now the backlog is (at most) an hour
[16:18] <J_Milburn> That guy reads... Weirdly. He's speaking as if he's reached some sort of fucking enlightenment
[16:18] <Ironholds> best thing I've ever done (excluding my GAs/FAs/FLs/DYKs/whatever
[16:18] <Aqwis> you're about 50x as hardworking as I am ;P
[16:18] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: more an enbastardment, but similar
[16:18] <Ironholds> Aqwis: but I get 50x more verbal abuse, so it works out :P
[16:18] <Aqwis> heh
[16:19] <J_Milburn> I particularly liked the claim that we should oppose you because you broke the new page system
[16:19] <J_Milburn> As, of course, it was DESIGNED to have a backlog
[16:20] <J_Milburn> When you get genuine criticism for clearing backlogs (not even the method, just the fact you cleared it) you know someone, somewhere, has about a bullet's worth less lead in their head than they need
[16:21] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: hahaha, excellent phrase
[16:21] <Ironholds> personally, I would consider that a waste of good lead
[16:22] <Ironholds> his second argument was "if you've only got an hour of backlog, people will go through it hastily when people haven't finished articles and mistakes will be made!"
[16:22] <Ironholds> 1) people should maybe make sure new articles, say, pass the notability guidelines off the bat?
[16:22] <J_Milburn> It's clear the guy (I forget who it was now) was just looking for reasons to oppose you for his own reasons
[16:23] <Ironholds> 2) if you've got an hour of backlog you can kick back, maybe open a beer and go through it as slowly and in as much detail as you want. If you've got 30 fucking days, you've got to be frantic because the pages will vanish from the logs in a matter of minutes
[16:23] <J_Milburn> Now, a solid reason to oppose is a solid reason, no matter why it was presented, but it does raise interesting questions about the motive
[16:23] <Ironholds> Colonel Warden, I believe. Part of the little group of inclusionists.
[16:23] <J_Milburn> Yeah, there was a real swathe of inclusionists opposing
[16:23] <J_Milburn> Thankfully, that brigade didn't exist when I was promoted
[16:23] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: DGG and User:IPthingy found it appropriate to make bitey little comments at AfDs
[16:23] <J_Milburn> As a new page patroller
[16:24] <J_Milburn> I've always found DGG a little difficult to work with
[16:24] <Ironholds> "the nominator obviously didn't search for sources" "obviously, you've been patrolling new pages too fast" "is this what you'd do as an administrator?"

[16:26] <Ironholds> he's A7
[16:26] <Ironholds> hangs around here sometimes
[16:26] <J_Milburn> I'm sure they've irritated me recently
[16:26] <Ironholds> or Antivenin, I think
[16:26] <J_Milburn> Aditya's the username
[16:26] <Ironholds> Whatever, inclusionists are the second against the wall when the revolution comes
[16:27] <J_Milburn> If I was forced to choose, I'm probably inclusionist as a philosophy
[16:27] <J_Milburn> But people assume I'm a deletionist because I support deleting bullshit
[16:27] <J_Milburn> But I certainly love Wikipedia for covering quirky, obscure little subjects
[16:27] <Ironholds> haha
[16:27] <J_Milburn> Wow
[16:28] <Ironholds> no, don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those WE-MUST-ONLY-COVER-REAL-ENCYCLOPEDIC-TOPICS people
[16:28] <J_Milburn> Now I remember why he pissed me off- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Aditya#Wikipedia:WikiCup.2F2010_Signups
[16:28] <Ironholds> I prefer to judge articles on their own merits
[16:28] <J_Milburn> He signed up to the WikiCup with a smiley face
[16:28] <J_Milburn> Then, when I said "no, only real or historical places, please"
[16:28] <J_Milburn> He signed up with Nazi Germany
[16:28] <J_Milburn> Then argued the toss when I told him to not be a diclk
[16:28] <Ironholds> but I can't stand the ARS editors who approach each AfD scrabbling for ways to keep the massively important article about My Mate Joey's Band Who Got To Play At Our Radio Station
[16:28] <Ironholds> ahh, I remember that
[16:29] <Ironholds> I'm really regretting not going for the cup this year. Ahh well, next year :p
[16:29] <J_Milburn> You're welcome to help out with reviews :)
[16:30] <Ironholds> noted :P
[16:30] <Ironholds> I've got six articles still waiting to be reviewed
[16:30] <Ironholds> haha, I love the law
[16:31] <J_Milburn> Ironholds: I got hold of The White Beyond, by ThouShaltNot; it's great. Like a more exciting, industrial Cruxshadows
[16:31] <Ironholds> there's a textbook written by "Cretney & Lush". How twee is that?
[16:31] * MisterWiki has joined #wikipedia-en
[16:31] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: aye! try "The Holiness of Now" next, it was released at the same time (somehow) and is quite similar
[16:31] <J_Milburn> It makes me cringe how every book from before 1980 on religion or philosophy was written by someone exeedingly upperclass
[16:31] <Ironholds> they also have Land Dispute, which was 06
[16:31] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: don't forget history
[16:32] <J_Milburn> "For example, if my maid was to..."
[16:32] <Ironholds> one of the standard 1960s history books was written by the Hon. Frederick Edwin Birkenhead, 2nd Earl of Birkenhead
[16:32] <Ironholds> aha, let me find you that amusing case. One moment.
[16:34] <Ironholds> you know Lady Chatterly's Lover?
[16:34] <Ironholds> the chief prosecutor at the obscenity trial in 1959 tried to appeal to the jury by asking if it were the kind of book "you would wish your wife or servants to read".
[16:36] <Ironholds> *smirk*
[16:36] <Ironholds> it's 2:34 and I bought a packed of 10 cigarettes this morning. How do I only have four left?
[16:37] <J_Milburn> My conclusion: You're a dirty smoker
[16:38] <Ironholds> I'm a clean smoker
[16:38] <Ironholds> I dump my butts in a coke can
[16:38] <Ironholds> ..wait, that's still fairly od
[16:38] <Ironholds> d
[16:39] <Ironholds> in my defence, my bin is packed and I always have an empty can of coke
[16:39] <J_Milburn> Hah
[16:39] <Ironholds> ...my coke habit being why my bin is always packed...
[16:39] <Ironholds> it's moments like this when I wonder why god hasn't struck me down long ago. Then I realise he's a crock of shit
[16:40] <Aqwis> coke habit
[16:40] <Aqwis> hmm
[16:40] <J_Milburn> Oh God
[16:40] <J_Milburn> Another Dramaout coming up
[16:40] <J_Milburn> Some people COMPLETELY missed the point last year
[16:40] <J_Milburn> I posted on the talk page saying I wouldn't be participating, as I was one of the few new image patrolling at the time
[16:41] <J_Milburn> And I then tagged an image of one of the participants
[16:41] <Ironholds> idiots
[16:41] <Ironholds> dramaouts are flawed, for two good reasons
[16:41] <J_Milburn> He contacted me and said "can we please delay the discussion until after the dramaout"?
[16:41] <Ironholds> 1) dramawhores don't participate, because... they're dramawhores
[16:41] <Ironholds> 2) a certain level of what pimply fourteen year old vandal-fighters consider "drama" is necessary
[16:42] <Ironholds> 3) people take "dramaout" to mean "don't work". Give me a ten-pack of benson and hedges, a six-pack of coke and the massive stack of judicial and legal textbooks, biographies and guides on the shelf behind me and I could produce more articles in a single night than they did.
[16:42] <J_Milburn> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:The_Great_Wikipedia_Dramaout#Areas_of_Wikipedia_exempted Seems they're allowing more drama this year
[16:43] <Ironholds> haha
[16:43] <Ironholds> "the great wiki dramaout, excluding certain areas of drama which are permissible"
[16:43] <Ironholds> kind of defeats the purpose if you're willing to redefine "drama"
[16:43] <J_Milburn> Hmmm... I could actually spam the dramaout on the WikiCup newsletters
[16:43] <J_Milburn> I wonder if they'd be willing to make WikiCup submission pages exempt?
[16:43] <Ironholds> it is also a tactit admission that the initial idea was significantly flawed
[16:43] <J_Milburn> Yup
[16:44] <J_Milburn> HAHAHAHAH
[16:44] <J_Milburn> The dramaout is apparently "bottom" importance within the Department of Fun WikiProject
[16:45] <Ironholds> Department of Fun?
[16:45] <Ironholds> for fucks SAKES
[16:45] <Ironholds> this is an encyclopedia!
[16:45] <Ironholds> we've got thousands of shit articles!
[16:45] <J_Milburn> That's the epitome of the shit that the dramaout should be ignoring
[16:46] <Ironholds> I want to change Wikipedia's motto to "we have shit articles. Either write them, improve them, maintain them or get the FUCK out of my way"
[16:46] <Ironholds> try ThouShaltNot's "When I Crash", btw
[16:46] <Ironholds> any bands you've got for me?
[16:48] <Ironholds> on an unrelated note, fair play to the Amazon reviewer who described Michael Macintyre as "a bobble-headed nugget about as fun as a trip to the GUM clinic"

[16:54] <J_Milburn> At least he's not as bad as Peter Kay...
[16:55] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: Macintyre is unoffensive, middle of the road pap
[16:55] <Ironholds> he should title his next DVD "Michael Macintyre: comedy your aged grandmother wouldn't find offensive"
[16:56] <Ironholds> he says normal things in a ridiculous voice and bobbles. That isn't comedy, that's hackery

[16:56] <Ironholds> and note, I don't like Dane Cook

[17:51] <tombom> these are called "romance novels"

[18:06] <Ironholds> it reminds me of your ArbCom statement, Ottava :P
[18:06] <Qcoder00> Ottava: Erm...
[18:06] <Ottava> Which statement?
[18:06] <Ottava> I've made many
[18:06] <Ottava> "Me too." Her eyes slowly closed and her breathing slowed down. I held her against my chest and kissed her one last time before she fell asleep.
[18:06] <Ottava> "I love you, Wikipe-tan," I whispered again as I joined her in deep, blissful sleep.

[18:08] <tombom> wasn't he underage for arbcom too? or am i thinking of something else

[18:48] <Rjanag> that doesn't sound like a big deal to me
[18:48] <Ironholds> Qcoder: lets stick that in the "incredibly unlikely" box, shall we
[18:48] <Ironholds> although we do have a baronet editing
[18:48] <Rjanag> plenty of people have joke names like that
[18:48] <Qcoder00> Rjanag: It's confusing
[18:49] <Rjanag> for example, I don't t hink User:Master of Puppets is the REAL master of puppets
[18:49] <Rjanag> although I could be wrong
[18:49] <Ottava> Ohai Rjanag
[18:49] <Rjanag> hey ottava?
[18:49] <Ironholds> Qcoder: if I become User:Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, does that mean I'm likely to be thought of as Gordon Brown?
[18:49] <Rjanag> how's life treating you?
[18:49] * Freya has quit IRC
[18:49] <Ottava> Okay, I guess. Still banned, so

[18:50] <JSLR|mobile> Lol
[18:50] <Qcoder00> I am sure people in the UK HAVE got into trouble for using names online that were simmilar to titles
[18:50] <Ottava> How are you?
[18:50] <JSLR|mobile> Really
[18:50] <JSLR|mobile> Why
[18:50] <JSLR|mobile> :/
[18:50] <Ottava> Qcoder00 - Ironholds's previous account name was Lord Sugerbottom of Assbury
[18:51] <Rjanag> good... not very active these days, but you know

[18:51] <Ottava> Rjanag - it happens

[18:51] <Ottava> Qcoder00 - Nah
[18:51] <Ironholds> Ottava: how did you find out about my peerage?
[18:51] <Ironholds> and there is a Baron of Stoke-Cum-Ebony

[18:52] <Ottava> lulz
[18:52] <Ironholds> which sounds like a genital disease, to be honest
[18:52] <Ironholds> black, hard pustules instead of jizz
[18:52] <JSLR|mobile> Qcoder00: What ARE you talking about
[18:52] <Ottava> Or, they like black people?
[18:52] <Ironholds> JSLR: He thinks User:DuchessofSutherland might be the Duchess of Sutherland
[18:52] <Ironholds> Ottava: when stoned
[18:52] <Qcoder00> I don't actually
[18:52] <JSLR|mobile> Lololol
[18:52] <Qcoder00> But it's confusing
[18:52] <Ironholds> or that people might THINK she is
[18:52] <JSLR|mobile> Unlikely
[18:52] <Ironholds> Qcoder: not really
[18:53] <JSLR|mobile> Very unlikely
[18:53] <Ottava> Well, are sandwiches in the UK confused with nobility?
[18:53] <JSLR|mobile> Is there a duchess of Sutherland
[18:53] <Qcoder00> JSLR|mobile:  I think there is an active Duke...
[18:53] <shimgray> yes.
[18:53] <JSLR|mobile> Oh
[18:53] <JSLR|mobile> Even so
[18:53] <Ottava> Sir Loin was knighted by James II, but I doubt people confuse steak with titled individuals
[18:54] <JSLR|mobile> Lolol
[18:54] <Ottava> There are many men in the UK named St John, but I doubt people think they are an actual saint
[18:54] <Ironholds> Shimgray: ohai
[18:54] <Ottava> some may be
[18:54] <Ironholds> Ottava: no, because it's pronounced "sinjin"
[18:54] <Ottava> but that isnt the common perception
[18:54] <shimgray> afternoon
[18:55] <Ottava> Yes, I know
[18:55] <Ironholds> Shimgray: how goes?
[18:55] <Ottava> My mother named one of her dogs that name

[18:58] <Ottava> "One theory is that beef Wellington is named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington ."
[18:58] <MissAlyx> months ago he edited saying christ myth theory supporters were the same as holocaust deniers, and EVERYBODY objected, and it was edited back
[18:58] <MissAlyx> then he did it again
[18:58] <Ottava> My theory, I guess
[18:58] <MissAlyx> everybody objected, editing back
[18:58] <MissAlyx> .. he did it again, and that time it stuck
[18:58] <MissAlyx> until i edited it
[18:59] <MissAlyx> and then he was like OMG DONT EDIT IT
[18:59] <JSLR|mobile> Idling now
[18:59] <MissAlyx> and edited it back

[19:00] <Ottava> Why do you hate Jesus so much?
[19:00] <Ottava> Because he was Jewish?
[19:00] <Ottava> : P

[19:04] <shimgray> mmm?
[19:04] <JSLR|mobile> Looks rather odd
[19:04] <Ironholds> Shimgray: the layout went like this. The court had a single judge.
[19:04] <KimiNewt> Seems fine..
[19:04] <Ironholds> he was assisted by 12 clerks
[19:04] <KimiNewt> It's like the hebrew one
[19:04] <Ironholds> the senior clerk was assisted by 6 clerks
[19:04] <Ironholds> the 6 clerks were each assisted by 10 clerks
[19:04] <JSLR|mobile> It looks shit
[19:05] <Ironholds> all of the 6 clerks' 10 clerks were assisted by a pair of underclerks and a registrar. Each.

[19:07] <JSLR|mobile> Nobody cares
[19:07] <Ironholds> Eventually they solved it in 1875, with the tried and tested method of blowing shit up
[19:07] <JSLR|mobile> :)
[19:07] <KimiNewt> It's been so long!
[19:07] <Ironholds> JSLR: about your mum

[19:07] <shimgray> &c, &
[19:07] <JSLR|mobile> Lol
[19:08] <KimiNewt> hey, someone else uses &c.! hurray
[19:08] <Ottava> Ironholds had Parliament trying to reform him for 360 years? omai
[19:08] <KimiNewt> ???????? ????? ???? ?????? ?????? ???????
[19:08] <Ottava> And he talks about people trying to reform me!
[19:08] <KimiNewt> or does that not encode
[19:08] <Ironholds> Ottava: it didn't work, unfortunately they didn't check I was alive
[19:08] <MissAlyx> some editors really just need banning...
[19:08] <JSLR|mobile> No
[19:08] <MissAlyx> just.. like.. banning.. forever.. and then killed..
[19:08] <Ottava> Ironholds, you've never been alive
[19:08] <Ironholds> god I'm a geek
[19:08] <JSLR|mobile> Right I'm off
[19:08] <JSLR|mobile> Later
[19:08] <Ottava> By Jossu : )
[19:08] <Ironholds> me and Narson are going to the spring FedCon in Brumland, and our first thought was "we should have a wikimeet"
[19:08] <Aqwis2> MissAlyx, editor euthanasia?
[19:08] <JSLR|mobile> Bye Ottava
[19:09] <JSLR|mobile> :)
[19:09] <MissAlyx> no, just kill them :P
[19:09] <Qcoder00> :O
[19:09] <Aqwis2> I see.
[19:09] <Qcoder00> :(
[19:09] <MissAlyx> and what annoys me more, is the staff who for some strange reason agree with the editors who are obviously trying to cause trouble

[19:09] <Ottava> So Aqwis2, where did you hide Aqwis one's corpse?
[19:09] <Ironholds> Ottava: with JSLR's mum
[19:09] <Qcoder00> This channell has got silly
[19:09] <Qcoder00> :(
[19:10] <Ironholds> Qcoder: if you leave, you wont be able to see it
[19:10] <Ottava> This channel has always been silly
[19:10] <Ironholds> problem solved
[19:10] <Ottava> almost as silly as the English Channel
[19:10] <Ottava> but with less dying princesses
[19:10] <Ironholds> Ottava: the English Channel is wonderful
[19:10] <Aqwis2> don't tell anyone, but Aqwis one's corpse now serves on the ArbCom
[19:10] <Ironholds> protecting us from uninvited Krauts since the beginning of time
[19:10] <Ironholds> except the northern Krauts pre-1066
[19:10] <Aqwis2> :)
[19:10] <KimiNewt> wow, we're at 3,146k articles already?
[19:10] <KimiNewt> how long till 4m?
[19:11] <Ironholds> Kiminewt: a long time, hopefully
[19:11] <Ironholds> seeing as I have to patrol all of them
[19:11] <Ottava> Aqwis is on the ArbCom?
[19:11] <Ottava> omai
[19:11] <Ottava> how did that happen?
[19:11] <Qcoder00> Ironholds: Weren't most of them Scandanavian?
[19:11] <Aqwis2> his corpse is!
[19:11] <Ironholds> Ottava: he got 4 percent of the vote, and that was enough to get in the top 8
[19:11] <Ottava> Well, at least a dead body is better than shell kinney
[19:11] <Ironholds> Qcoder: yes. Most. :P
[19:11] <Ottava> I need a drum roll for that

[19:11] <Ottava> Ironholds - sad but true
[19:11] <Ironholds> I can give you a lone tamborine?
[19:11] <Ottava> On both
[19:11] <Ottava> : )

[19:12] * Ironholds rings a small tamborine, dismally
[19:12] <Qcoder00> Aqwis: The Growth is slowing?
[19:12] <Ironholds> Aqwis: to be fair, not much to write new articles on

[19:12] <Aqwis2> sounds like an indie band
[19:13] <Qcoder00> Aqwis: ROFL
[19:13] <Qcoder00> :)

[20:11] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: Once I've finished my current article, would you be interested in carrying out that wager?
[20:11] <Ottava> What wager?
[20:12] <Ironholds> Ottava: Solipsism/Stoicism (I forget) to GA and he owes me a pint
[20:12] <Ironholds> FA and he owes me a gig ticket to any Alfa Matrix gig in Britain
[20:12] <MisterWiki> could someone take a look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Américo
[20:12] <MisterWiki> and correct my grammar?
[20:13] <J_Milburn> Ironholds: The pint was mine, the Alfa Matrix gig was yours
[20:13] <J_Milburn> But I will certainly buy you a pint
[20:14] <J_Milburn> Some way, some how
[20:14] <J_Milburn> I owe you it :)
[20:14] <KimiNewt> no such article!
[20:15] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: howso?
[20:15] <Ironholds> yeah, that sounds familiar
[20:15] <Ironholds> was it Stoicism or Solipsism?
[20:15] <J_Milburn> Solipsism
[20:15] <Ironholds> yeah, sounds right
[20:15] <J_Milburn> Though Stoicism is something which is probably covered far worse than it should be
[20:15] <Ironholds> also the solipsism article is shitter
[20:16] <Ironholds> Stoicism is better than solipsism, actually
[20:16] <Patar_knight> Is solipsism the one where you can only prove you exist because you are thinking?
[20:16] <Ottava> Sloppism seems to be most popular
[20:19] <Ironholds> Patar: Solipsism is that you can't prove anything exists but you
[20:20] <Ironholds> the "only exists because you are thinking" thing is cartesian thought, which is related, but not the same thing
[20:20] <Ironholds> Solipsism is interesting, but horribly flawed
[20:20] <Patar_knight> Ok. So I defined it more broadly.
[20:21] <Ironholds> sorta
[20:21] <Patar_knight> And solipsism wouldn't be able to be proven or disproven
[20:21] <Ironholds> it can't be proven or disproven, but it can be shown to be invalid
[20:21] <Ironholds> what solipsists are essentially arguing is that there is a higher power orchestrating events; the old brain in a jar thing
[20:21] <geniice> what is it with january and interesting requests for adminship?
[20:21] <MuZemike> O-O
[20:22] <Ironholds> so they argue that a power capable of creating an infinitely complex universe is there, an omnipotent power outside their direct control
[20:22] <MuZemike> o_o
[20:22] <Ironholds> and the difference between that and reality iiiiiss?
[20:22] <Jake_Wartenberg> Ironholds: All our philosophy articles are terrible.
[20:22] <Ironholds> MuZemike: first me, then Sam Blacketer
[20:22] <Ironholds> Jake: indeed
[20:22] <Ironholds> Unfortunately I'm not a philosopher
[20:22] <Ironholds> and I hate the majority of philosophers
[20:22] <Ironholds> it's not a decent argument, most of the time it's linguistics
[20:22] <geniice> last year me
[20:23] <geniice> and another former admin
[20:23] <Ironholds> not "here is why you are wrong", just "here is why your question is invalid"
[20:23] <Ironholds> ech
[20:23] <Jake_Wartenberg> Sophistry.
[20:24] <Ironholds> bullshit, yes

[21:03] <Qcoder00> Compared to the last time my tagging was reviewd bya  lot of people
[21:04] <MisterWiki> jdelanoy: ?
[21:04] <Qcoder00> J_Milburn : There is the issue of the {{May be Uploader}} template that needs looking into though
[21:04] <Qcoder00> As ideally most of those have now had  more than a while to respond
[21:04] <Qcoder00> ^those images
[21:05] <J_Milburn> Yes, so deal with it
[21:05] <Qcoder00> I would
[21:05] <J_Milburn> You create these templates and yes, the tagging is nice, but it would often be better just to deal with the issue
[21:06] <Qcoder00> but dealing with those images was why I got listed on WP:ANI
[21:06] <Qcoder00> {{May Be Uploader}} was intended as a means of  preventing a bunch of zealots getting me banned
[21:06] <J_Milburn> Ok
[21:06] <zscout370> Qcoder00, I am facing a similar issue at the Commons trying to deal with PD images that just use {{PD}} as the license
[21:07] <Qcoder00> So it needs someone with more clout to 'nuke' them
[21:07] <Qcoder00> because I don't have the authority to do so
[21:07] <Qcoder00> I also got told off for adding  source information based on the uploaders...
[21:09] <zscout370> Qcoder00, is there category for images tagged with that template?
[21:09] <Qcoder00> Zscout370: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:May_be_uploader&limit=500

[21:12] <Shirik> I mean I could write a script to do it, but imo that should be unnecessary
[21:12] <Qcoder00> Zscout370, J_Milburn: Any help you can offer in 'deprecating' the {{May be Uploader}} template appreciated
[21:12] <Ottava> The Porn images with dubious releases are the most heavily defended PD images
[21:12] <Ottava> no proof info to say that the picture actually was taken by the uploader
[21:13] <Ottava> not even the camera data
[21:13] <zscout370> Qcoder00, I am getting a list

[21:14] <Ottava> yes it is

[21:26] <Qcoder00> I'm going through a list Betacommand provided , marking up the ones that might need looking at again
[21:26] <zscout370> once those are whittled down, will go at it again

[21:26] <Ottava> http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6974104.ece
[21:26] <Ottava> There was some futuristic scifi thing in which there were huge cities that were basically a mile high building
[21:26] <Ottava> We need some of them
[21:26] <Ottava> 4 miles across
[21:26] <Ottava> 1 mile high
[21:26] <Ottava> that would be awesome
[21:26] <zscout370> Qcoder00, only 180 someodd images

[21:26] <Ottava> JamesC93 - I was talking about my RfA votes
[21:26] <Ottava> I opposed you
[21:27] <Ottava> but mostly because you are one with the bots
[21:27] <Qcoder00> zscout370: On the May Be Uploader?
[21:27] <Qcoder00> Hmm
[21:27] <zscout370> yeah
[21:27] <Qcoder00> OK
[21:27] <Ottava> I supported JDelanoy because, though he is a robot himself, he is like the good robot from iRobot that tries to help humanity

[21:50] <zscout370> I am just going to tag them all as {{own}}
[21:50] <Ottava> He was told from grammar books why
[21:50] <Ottava> And from works on Keats that favor "Keats's"
[21:50] <Ottava> His argument was "my mom taught me this way"
[21:50] <Ottava> and he proceeded to personally attack and edit war
[21:51] <Qcoder00> NativeForeigner:  See - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sfan00_IMG/Conflicted-_Jan_1st_2010
[21:51] <J_Milburn> Yeah, probably worth doing
[21:51] <Qcoder00> A conflicted image is one that has both a 'free' and 'non-free' license tag on it
[21:51] <Qcoder00> Which is of course impossible!
[21:51] <NativeForeigner> Qcoder00: AWB?
[21:51] <Qcoder00> In an image can't be Both free and unfree
[21:51] <Qcoder00> NativeForeigner:  I do my tagging manually
[21:52] <Qcoder00> I don't use AWB
[21:52] <NativeForeigner> I normally do
[21:52] <NativeForeigner> that's just an AWBish task
[21:52] <Qcoder00> Anyway: The list on that page (not that the page is formated fully)
[21:52] <Qcoder00> Is a partial list of all the conflicted images
[21:53] <Qcoder00> Ideally , they should if still conflicted tagged as {{Conflicted-license}} and the original uploaders notified

[21:54] <BasketOfPuppies> what about puppies?
[21:55] <Qcoder00> where <name of image> is the filename without the File: prefix
[21:55] <NativeForeigner> Qcoder00: I'll probably have to do it manually
[21:55] <Qcoder00> Well
[21:55] <Ottava> Puppies don't promote IRC love : P
[21:55] <Qcoder00> Sorry
[21:55] <Qcoder00> but the more people working on it the bettwr
[21:55] <Qcoder00> BTW If you can directly fix some images, do so
[21:56] <Qcoder00> (and they can be dropped off the list entirly)
[21:56] <NativeForeigner> i'll try to whip something up anyways

[22:01] <NativeForeigner> can't find it Qcoder00

[22:03] <Qcoder00> NativeForeigner: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sfan00_IMG/Conflicted-_Jan_1st_2010 is a list of stuff needing to be tagged up
[22:04] <NativeForeigner> got it

[22:05] <Qcoder00> I'm just about to format some of the sections...
[22:06] <NativeForeigner> where should I place the tag Qcoder00
[22:06] <Ottava> Im going to head out
[22:06] <Ottava> later
[22:07] <Qcoder00> On the images concerned, place the {{Conflicted-license}} tag at the top like you would any other maintainance tag

[22:10] <Qcoder00> NativeForeigner:  Ok 0-9 A-D formatted
[22:10] <Qcoder00> That should give you some stuff to start with
[22:10] <Qcoder00> whilst I format the other 20 or so sections
[22:11] <Qcoder00> OK Start at the top , 0-9, A-D should be ready to be checked :)

[22:25] * vishwin has quit IRC ("reboot")
[22:25] * GuidodB has quit IRC (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
[22:25] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: well, yes, for fairly obvious reasons
[22:25] <MissAlyx> peeeefectly fine to be anti-nazi and quite offensive ("doesnt like nazis"..), but im sure as hell i couldnt make "doesnt like black people" or similar
[22:26] <Ironholds> no, because almost NOBODY likes nazis
[22:26] <MissAlyx> so?
[22:26] <Ironholds> "I don't like black people" comes under the heading of "likely to be highly offensive to a lot of people"
[22:26] <Ironholds> as prohibited by the userpage policy
[22:26] <Ironholds> although not in those words

[22:26] <MissAlyx> "doesnt like nazis" would be highly offensive to any nazi/neo-pazi people
[22:27] <MissAlyx> lol, pazi.... nazi*
[22:27] <Aqwis2> fortunately, nobody cares about nazis and neo-nazis
[22:27] <[Soap]> Pazifismus
[22:27] <Qcoder00> Erm... I get the sense someone might be trolling
[22:27] <MissAlyx> why is it fine to "not like" one group, but not another?
[22:27] <MissAlyx> am i allowed to hate on gay people, because "most people dont like gay people" :|?
[22:27] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: you're welcome to if it leads to your eventual suicide
[22:27] <MissAlyx> it doesnt, im gay, so i obviously like gay people :P
[22:28] <Ironholds> Personally, I welcome our homosexual, suicidal neo-nazi overlords
[22:28] <Ironholds> I know
[22:28] <Ironholds> but I was hoping
[22:28] <GuidodB> You can always hate yourself, if all else fails
[22:28] <Ironholds> the test is "likely to offend". Since there are a teeny-tiny number of nazis, it's not likely to offend people
[22:28] * Cyclone|AFK is now known as Typhoon
[22:28] <MissAlyx> so its fine to offend minority groups because theres not many of them?
[22:29] <Ironholds> "there is broad agreement that you may not include in your user space material that is likely to bring the project into disrepute, or which is likely to give widespread offense"
[22:29] <[Soap]> I dont think Ive ever heard of a Nazi being offended by something
[22:29] <Ironholds> Soap: except Jews
[22:29] <GuidodB> Apparently, narrowly spread offense is allowed
[22:29] <MissAlyx> if i said "This user doesn't think the nazis were that bad", surely that wouldnt offend the whole world
[22:30] <Aqwis2> jews, gypsies and disabled people all offend nazis
[22:30] <Aqwis2> by existing?
[22:30] <MissAlyx> it just offends the dumbed down .. .. ma...jority.... :/

[22:30] <MissAlyx> Aqwis2: and alcoholics, and smokers
[22:30] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: would it bring the project into disrepute? Possibly. Would it give widespread offense? yes
[22:30] <MissAlyx> hitler hated smokers
[22:30] <Aqwis2> and... and... homosexuals.
[22:30] <MissAlyx> meh, he was right for some things, not right for others
[22:30] <Qcoder00> ironholds: Would it create potential legal risks?
[22:30] <Ironholds> and anyone who thinks Nazis "weren't that bad" needs his clock cleaned
[22:30] <MissAlyx> he can hate on smokers and alcoholics all he wants :P
[22:30] <Ironholds> Qcoder: not for US servers, no
[22:30] <Ironholds> if anyone found out where Alyx lives, yes
[22:31] <Ironholds> although historically we've refused all extradition treaties and trials for such things
[22:31] <MissAlyx> im fairly sure i'd be fine in britain :/
[22:31] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: you would, except for the european directive against the glorification or support of the Nazis
[22:32] <Ironholds> but as said, the DPP and AG tend to flip the birdy in the general direction of brussels when such requests come over the channel, as they should
[22:32] <MissAlyx> its not glorification or support, its just an opinion based on a historical event

[22:32] <MissAlyx> that last one seems SLIGHTLY humorous D:

[22:33] <GuidodB> It makes me wonder which group of people were the worst, if not they
[22:33] <Ironholds> if they lose that competition it's only because they got knocked out early on by a first division team
[22:33] <MissAlyx> it seemed pretty funny to me :(

[22:34] <Ironholds> KimiNewt: well, basically
[22:34] <Ironholds> he supports eugenics
[22:35] <Ironholds> and feels that education = bad, because education is people telling you their view of events. This strips your ability to form your own opinions, and you should learn on your own
[22:35] <MissAlyx> Ironholds: you sorta got the wrong idea with the education thing, lol
[22:35] <Ironholds> Alyx: that's what you said to me
[22:35] <MissAlyx> i said its wrong to "teach politics"
[22:35] <KimiNewt> we don't need no
[22:35] <KimiNewt> education
[22:35] <MissAlyx> i didnt say education itself is wrong
[22:36] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: sorry? Part of any decent politics degree is "how to think for yourself"

[22:36] <Ironholds> unless you just think shit up in your head, which would make sense

[22:39] <Ironholds> inline citations are incredibly important
[22:40] <GuidodB> ArbCom mass resignation
[22:40] <Ironholds> ahh
[22:40] <Ironholds> well, you'll be pleased to know I've been killing them off
[22:40] <Ironholds> was it 1 or 2 I forced to resign?
[22:40] <KimiNewt> I don't see how inline citations are bad
[22:40] <GuidodB> Excellent, keep up the good work :)
[22:40] <KimiNewt> using normal refs is just if it sorta fits the whole article
[22:40] <Ironholds> KimiNewt: inlines are wonderful

[22:42] <Ironholds> my current draft has 50, and it's less than a third done
[22:42] <KimiNewt> Well, smaller wikipedias have lower standards
[22:43] <KimiNewt> should hit 100k articles in the next week
[22:43] <Ironholds> I've got about 2/3rds of the "History" section done, 2/3rds of the "Officers". Now I just need some stuff on the Judicature Acts, Vice-Chancellors and to drop an academic turd on the jurisdiction section
[22:43] <Ironholds> and then, voilla. FA.
[22:43] <KimiNewt> I only have like 18 citations in my longest one
[22:44] <KimiNewt> Not as experienced as you are I figure
[22:44] <GuidodB> Hmm, i have a few more I think

[22:45] <zscout370> German
[22:45] <zscout370> they just hit a million about 2 weeks ago
[22:45] <Warrior4321> and even they dont have inline citations..damn it
[22:45] <Warrior4321> does any wiki other than the english one have inline citations?
[22:46] <KimiNewt> yes
[22:46] <Aqwis2> as far as I know most Wikipedias have sporadic inline citations

[22:50] <Ironholds> I'm from the 90s, just
[22:50] <Warrior4321> No, I wouldn't suggest splitting until the flora part is expanded.

[23:17] <tombom> oh right
[23:17] * GuidodB thinks that 90% of WP's discussion pages would then need to be deleted
[23:17] <coffee> Pedro was way way out of line
[23:17] <tombom> was it an arbcom thing
[23:17] <coffee> yes

[23:18] <tombom> ah ok

[23:18] * jd|afk is now known as jdelanoy
[23:18] <coffee> in one thread Nerd said that he passed RFA 2 years before that thread... and Pedro passed two years before that thread
[23:19] <tombom> the evidence is mounting
[23:19] <tombom> clever detective work
[23:19] <coffee> well lets just say I work around intelligence ;)

[23:20] <Qcoder00> Any admins?
[23:20] <coffee> Qcoder00: no
[23:20] <Aqwis2> yes, Qcoder00
[23:20] <coffee> we iz not admins
[23:20] <GuidodB> Sure. Just not on WP
[23:20] <Qcoder00> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Auto5.jpg - What the **** is that image?
[23:21] <Qcoder00> because I'ts the one remaining image using {{May be uploader}}
[23:21] <NativeForeigner> ...
[23:21] <NativeForeigner> ask him
[23:21] <Aqwis2> a pirate with a Wikipedia logo hat sitting on a magical carpet
[23:21] <Aqwis2> playing a flute
[23:22] <Qcoder00> I will do...
[23:22] <Aqwis2> actually, the carpet is stuck on a mountain
[23:22] <tombom> somebody asked him in 2004
[23:22] <tombom> i don't think you'll have much luck
[23:22] <zscout370> Qcoder00, using tineye as a guide, it turns out it is that users personal icon used on webpages
[23:22] <Qcoder00> OK
[23:22] <zscout370> http://www.tineye.com/search/79bdce88ed83b8893e77240686fd7cc66c8aa20c

[23:23] <slakr> :P
[23:23] <zscout370> slakr, now I wish tineye could be brought to en.wp
[23:23] <slakr> I could do that
[23:23] <zscout370> please
[23:23] <slakr> ... but I need imagez
[23:23] <slakr> I was discussing the idea with someone to get the commons database
[23:24] <slakr> of course, that was apparently well over a terabyte
[23:24] <slakr> or something like that
[23:24] <zscout370> slakr, you know how tineye works for all Commons images
[23:24] <zscout370> I want that same function for en.wp
[23:24] <Qcoder00> zscout370: Tineye has a commercial API now
[23:24] * LauraHale is now known as Luara|Away
[23:24] <slakr> hmm
[23:25] <Qcoder00> So implementing an upload check needs someone to donate the money to pay the API fees
[23:25] <slakr> so then how do I get enwiki's image database?
[23:25] <Qcoder00> slakr: DB dump?
[23:25] <slakr> screw that, I've already written tineye long before tineye was made
[23:25] <slakr> ph33r

[23:25] <slakr> (I lie, I was having trouble testing scalability because I was a poor college kid)
[23:26] <zscout370> Qcoder00, it is sites like that and copyscape that I would like to see our funds being used on
[23:26] * J_Milburn has quit IRC (No route to host)

[23:27] <coffee> they're both from Britain
[23:27] <slakr> (which is the problem, as afaik they're not available)
[23:28] <tombom> britain is quite a large place
[23:28] <Qcoder00> slakr: Try asking in -tech?
[23:28] <coffee> yes but it shrinks it down
[23:28] <tombom> but the wikimedia foundation is worthless

[23:40] <MissAlyx> does anyone know how many nazis died in WW2?
[23:40] <MissAlyx> i cant find it, tried googling..
[23:40] <MissAlyx> maybe someone else has some better keywords or already knows or something :|
[23:40] <ceranthor> Why do you need to know, ooC?
[23:40] <MissAlyx> ooC O.o?
[23:41] <Aqwis2> MissAlyx sympathises with the nazis
[23:41] <MissAlyx> oh come on, all i asked was a simple question :|
[23:41] <Aqwis2> I'm quite sure Wikipedia has an article which may give you an approximate number.
[23:41] <MissAlyx> tried, couldnt find
[23:42] <MissAlyx> wait, maybe
[23:42] <Aqwis2> of course, you'll have to define "nazi"
[23:42] <MissAlyx> World_War_II_casualties sounds promising
[23:42] <Aqwis2> member of the Nazi Party?
[23:42] <Saryn> you'll have a tough time getting "nazis" specifically
[23:42] <Saryn> because the numbers I know are for the German state, and not just the army or party members
[23:43] <MissAlyx> Germany/Military Deaths: 5,533,000 	
[23:43] <slakr> that sounds off
[23:43] <MissAlyx> what, you think its lower?
[23:43] <Saryn> is that only for the military?
[23:43] <slakr> higher
[23:44] <MissAlyx> Germany (with nazi flag), "Military Deaths", 5,533,000 	
[23:44] <slakr> russia was like around 20 million I thought
[23:44] <Aqwis2> russia always loses huge numbers of soldiers
[23:44] <MissAlyx> Civilian deaths: 940,000 to 2,700,000
[23:44] <Saryn> Soviet Union lost 22 million
[23:44] <Saryn> China lost 17 million, iirc

[23:45] <MissAlyx> chinas TOTAL was "10,000,000 to 20,000,000"
[23:45] <MissAlyx> upto 16m of them are civilian
[23:45] <MissAlyx> that seems right O.o
[23:45] <MissAlyx> this was just for the sake of argument in another window.. someone said "maybe nazis are hated because of the 6m jews dead"
[23:45] <MissAlyx> and.. 5.5m nazis were killed
[23:45] * SonicAD has joined #wikipedia-en
[23:45] <MissAlyx> soo.... errrr......
[23:46] <Aqwis2> the nazi soldiers... engaged in warfare.
[23:46] <Aqwis2> the jews were innocent.
[23:46] <MissAlyx> as far as they were concerned, the jews werent innocent
[23:46] <Aqwis2> their opinion doesn't matter the least
[23:46] <MissAlyx> i have no real idea why he didnt like the jews, but he obviously had some reason
[23:46] <[Soap]> were still talking about this??
[23:46] <MissAlyx> [Soap]: no, this is a new one
[23:46] <[Soap]> ok
[23:47] <Dispenser> not this again? would you like be useful and make suggestions on improving my tool?
[23:47] <Dispenser> http://toolserver.org/~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py?page=Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts
[23:48] <MissAlyx> nazis come up here a lot, lol
[23:48] <Aqwis2> yes, it's because you're really into them.
[23:48] <MissAlyx> probably
[23:48] <Saryn> Nazis are interesting.
[23:48] <MissAlyx> it was a very interesting chunk of history
[23:49] <Narson> Everyone loves some fascism
[23:49] <MissAlyx> and the way hitler managed to get such huge support so quickly, it was amazing O.o
[23:49] <Saryn> Narson: I know I do.
[23:49] <MissAlyx> and the ralleys with millions of people
[23:49] <KimiNewt> okay

[23:49] <Aqwis2> MissAlyx, wrong
[23:49] <Aqwis2> rallies
[23:49] <MissAlyx> britain still kicked their ass, and britain still had the largest empire ever :P
[23:50] <Narson> Oceanic Assembly is the name for those mass rallies
[23:50] <Saryn> Britain hardly kicked their ass >.>
[23:50] <MissAlyx> we totally won the war, well.. us and russia
[23:50] <Aqwis2> you, Russia and the US
[23:50] <ceranthor> erm, I wouldn't say that.
[23:50] <Narson> Russia kicked their butt. We kicked their peripheral butt
[23:50] <Aqwis2> or just Russia and the US
[23:50] <ceranthor> I would say the United States pretty much finished it.
[23:51] <MissAlyx> russia finished it :/
[23:51] <ceranthor> Britain was helpful at Normandy because of the Us, iirc
[23:51] <MissAlyx> with their stuff-that-goes-boom
[23:51] <Saryn> Russia raped Germany.

[23:51] <MissAlyx> russia has always being really good at making stuff that explodes
[23:51] <Narson> Along with large parts of the naval support.
[23:51] <Saryn> There wouldn't have been a D-Day w/o Britain
[23:51] <Narson> Air cover
[23:51] <MisterWiki> hi again
[23:51] <MissAlyx> just not very good at aiming it
[23:51] <MissAlyx> america can put a missile through a window from 10 mile away.. russia just takes out the whole city
[23:52] <Aqwis2> killing a few millions of their own soldiers at the same time
[23:52] <Saryn> America likes to think that we can do that.
[23:52] <Saryn> But I'm sure Iraqi citizens have other stories. >.>
[23:53] <Aqwis2> but what's a few million soldiers?
[23:53] <MissAlyx> Aqwis2: yeah but.. the boom is so big!

[23:53] <MissAlyx> "the largest, most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated, and currently the most powerful explosive device ever created"
[23:53] <Narson> Russia was the big fighter though. While we fought a war across the globe, they fought one massive front, sure. But it was epic in terms of numbers. If you work out how big the German army was in 1944, the German army on the western front was 250,000 or so
[23:54] <MissAlyx> i'd be suprised if russia DOESNT still have really big bombs hidden away incase they need them :/
[23:54] <Narson> Hidden away?
[23:54] <Narson> They openly show them
[23:54] <ceranthor> That's because the US is not obsessed with weapon making ;)
[23:54] <MissAlyx> and then theres the "dead hand" thing o.o
[23:54] <Narson> They announced the movement of MRBMs to the Koenigsberg pocket the other day.
[23:54] <Saryn> ceranthor: wut
[23:54] <Narson> Uh, other year even
[23:54] <MissAlyx> which was like.. the stupidest idea.. EVER
[23:55] <MissAlyx> only russia would think the dead hand was a good idea
[23:55] <ceranthor> Yawn
[23:55] <MissAlyx> i still wonder what "The Buzzer" is for too o.o
[23:55] * NativeForeigner has joined #wikipedia-en
[23:55] <NativeForeigner> coffee: any AWB help available now?
[23:55] <MissAlyx> if deadhand is real, the buzzer is probably related to it somehow.. or as part of some system to identify what military bases are still active

[23:57] <MissAlyx> the buzzer has only stopped when people talk over it (iirc 3 times, ever).. so it makes sense, once the buzzer stops, the other bases then all START broadcasting to indicate theyre still alive and not a giant mush of metal and rock.. and the guy reading out random numbers and letters is reading out what bases are responding :P
[23:57] <MissAlyx> that was much longer than i thought it would be :|
