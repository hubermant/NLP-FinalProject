[00:00] <chempp> dang
[00:00] <chempp> i smashed the test tube
[00:06] <|James|> darn it ... hide it
[00:06] <aavogt> they aren't expensive
[00:06] <chempp> yeh i know :P
[00:06] <|James|> lol
[00:06] <chempp> i just hate buying them because you allways have to buy like 100 - 250
[00:09] <chempp> i want about 20 - 30 not 100 :P

[00:11] <pharsalus> I am a legend around my old chemistry department for clumsyness.
[00:12] <pharsalus> I broke about Â£400 worth of glassware in roughly 2 hours.
[00:12] <pharsalus> Not one of my best days...

[13:30] <chill|out> wuaaazaaaaaah
[13:30] <Andrew1986> I don't like going to 2 schools anymore
[13:31] <chill|out> http://asset.soup.io/asset/0441/6617_b9cd_420.jpeg
[13:31] <Andrew1986> lots of schedule conflicts
[13:31] <chill|out> you do at the moment?
[13:31] <chill|out> hehe yeah
[13:31] <chill|out> stressful
[13:31] <chill|out> i had to go to 2 schools, too, bc i made a wrong choice in fields
[13:32] <chill|out> and my school didnt deliver that but the other one at the end of town did
[13:32] <chill|out> it sucked for 2,5 years
[13:32] <chill|out> :)
[13:33] <Andrew1986> I thought the prof at the other school was a nice guy. I met him at a research centre, so I'm taking his course
[13:34] <chill|out> oh nice
[13:34] <chill|out> so u do that willingly =)
[13:34] <Andrew1986> do what willingly
[13:34] <Andrew1986> I don't have sex with professors, especially not with a guy
[13:35] <chill|out> hehe
[13:36] <Andrew1986> I remember the episode of Friends
[13:37] <chill|out> me too, now.
[13:37] <Andrew1986> a guy from Ross's class told him he loved him, so he can get a passing grade
[13:37] <chill|out> lol the gay one trying to get good grades from ross
[13:37] <Andrew1986> the guy wasn't gay
[13:37] <chill|out> exactly.
[13:38] <Andrew1986> he tells every prof he loved him or her
[13:38] <Andrew1986> it was funny
[13:38] <Andrew1986> when this other guy tells ross he loves him too
[13:38] <Andrew1986> and ross went, "he used me. he used me!!!"
[13:39] <chill|out> ^^ but hey ross was confused. maybe he was a litlle gay in this episode.. he is in real life anyways
[13:39] <chill|out> not so much in friends tho
[13:39] <chill|out> anyone humping rachel cant be gay now, can he.
[13:39] <Andrew1986> ross is not in real life
[13:39] <Andrew1986> ross is on friends
[13:40] <chill|out> david schwimmer is
[13:40] <chill|out> yaya =)
[13:40] <Andrew1986> who's david schwimmer
[13:40] * mal`` has quit IRC (Client Quit)
[13:40] <chill|out> the actor doing ross
[13:40] * mal`` has joined ##chemistry
[13:43] <chill|out> did u see the EP with bratt pitt?
[13:43] * Graf_Ithaka has joined ##chemistry
[13:43] <Graf_Ithaka> hi there =)
[13:43] <chill|out> the one with the turkey dinner
[13:43] <chill|out> hi Graf_Ithaka
[13:43] <chill|out> gruezi.
[13:43] <Graf_Ithaka> hi chill|out
[13:43] <chill|out> servus.
[13:43] <Andrew1986> ET
[13:43] <Graf_Ithaka> gruezi.. someone from swizerland, eh? ;)
[13:44] <Andrew1986> entertainment tonight
[13:44] <chill|out> EP = episode
[13:44] <Andrew1986> daladaladala
[13:44] <chill|out> no, a german imposting to be a switzerlander
[13:44] <chill|out> =)
[13:44] <Graf_Ithaka> hehe okay ;)
[13:44] <chill|out> vergellt's gott Graf_Ithaka
[13:45] <chill|out> lts*
[13:45] <chill|out> whats new in chemistry?
[13:45] <Graf_Ithaka> hehe someone's quite fluent in regional german phrases here ;)
[13:46] <Graf_Ithaka> well ahm.. not that much, studying for my OC exam in february and some others in the meantime ,)
[13:46] <Andrew1986> orange county
[13:46] <Andrew1986> california, california. lalalallalalalla
[13:46] <chill|out> no, not the tv-series ^^
[13:47] <chill|out> u watch chick-series?
[13:47] <chill|out> interesting fact.
[13:47] <chill|out> =)
[13:47] <Andrew1986> what chick series?
[13:47] <Andrew1986> lesbians in action?
[13:47] <chill|out> OC california
[13:48] <chill|out> Graf_Ithaka: happy exam
[13:48] <chill|out> end of feb?
[13:48] <chill|out> or in 2 weeks?
[13:48] <chill|out> i hated studying for OC
[13:48] <chill|out> too much to learn and too much to know
[13:49] <Andrew1986> I have research group meetings and presentations and other stuff
[13:50] * ro3 has quit IRC (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out))
[13:50] <Graf_Ithaka> chill|out: beginning of feb, 4.2.
[13:51] <Graf_Ithaka> chill|out: I dont like it either.. I'm more into PC and theoretical
[13:51] <Andrew1986> why do you have tests in feb?
[13:51] <Graf_Ithaka> cause I've got a lab in 4th semester for which I need to be qualified by a good result on the OC exam ;)
[13:52] <Graf_Ithaka> both possible dates for the exam are in february as the lecture goes up to the end of semester..
[13:52] <Andrew1986> we only have 2 semesters.
[13:52] <Andrew1986> how many semesters do you have each school year?
[13:52] <Graf_Ithaka> I'm not in school anymore.. I'm talking about university semesters..
[13:52] <Andrew1986> i'm in university too
[13:53] <Graf_Ithaka> yep so 2 semester / year.. 6 semesters for the bachelor degree.. 4 semesters for masters degree.. and you keep counting ;)
[13:53] <Andrew1986> for me, first semester starts in september and lasts until december. the second semester starts in january and lasts until April
[13:54] <Graf_Ithaka> yep and next year the same thing except that you keep counting and you start in 3rd semester and end the year in 4th semester..
[13:54] <Andrew1986> and during the 4 months of summer, we do research
[13:55] <Graf_Ithaka> yep additional labs in summer are possible if they take you ..
[13:55] <Andrew1986> so a bachelor degree takes 3 years?
[13:55] <Andrew1986> mine took me almost 5 years
[13:56] <Graf_Ithaka> 3 years at minimum..
[13:56] <Graf_Ithaka> if you dont study hard enough you'll be behind..
[13:56] <Andrew1986> that's nice
[13:57] <Graf_Ithaka> no its not.. beeing behing means paying extra fees for university
[13:57] <Andrew1986> that's nice
[13:57] <Andrew1986> university needs money
[13:57] <Graf_Ithaka> its.. lets call it "motivational" :D
[13:58] <Andrew1986> my professor pays me
[13:58] <Graf_Ithaka> Andrew1986: yepp, but I need it too :P as a student I'm not earning alot of money ^^
[13:58] <Andrew1986> are you a grad student?
[13:59] <Graf_Ithaka> I'm also on the payroll at university but that doesnt earn me alot ^^
[13:59] <Graf_Ithaka> Andrew1986: hm dont know your classifications.. atm I'm in 3rd semester of bachelor.. so I've been studying for 1.5 years now..
[14:00] <Andrew1986> so you are an undergraduate
[14:00] <Graf_Ithaka> okay good to know ;)
[14:00] <Andrew1986> are you a research assistant?
[14:01] <Graf_Ithaka> no.. only assistant in teaching ('tutor' as it is called here) atm
[14:01] <Andrew1986> and your school pays you to TA?
[14:01] <Andrew1986> TA = teaching assistant
[14:02] <Andrew1986> it's odd an undergrad can be a TA
[14:02] <Graf_Ithaka> if TA means teaching assistand.. yes, I'm getting payed for holding my courses each week
[14:03] <Andrew1986> what does "holding you courses" mean?
[14:03] <Andrew1986> do you get paid just by being a student?
[14:03] <Andrew1986> or do you have to work for it?
[14:04] <Graf_Ithaka> Andrew1986: yep 3rd semester is quite unusual here too.. but as its only for the 'general chemistry' course in 1st semester its possible.. being 'tutor' (TA) for a lecture means holding a course for questions cocnerning the stuff done in lecture.. its an easy way for students so ask questions and train themselves with someone who already has the exam
[14:05] <Graf_Ithaka> I have to answer questions of students and I'm doing some training exercises with them conerning all the topics related to the lecture they're in atm - just for 1.5 hrs / week
[14:05] <Andrew1986> I don't like freshmen. they are stupid
[14:06] <Andrew1986> do you go to waterloo, aavogt?
[14:06] <Graf_Ithaka> basically its meant to be useful for "freshmen" as you say to ask questions they are afraid to ask the professor or ask for help with problems they havent been able to solve at home
[14:07] <Andrew1986> that's nice
[14:08] <Graf_Ithaka> Andrew1986: well actually those who would be annoying dont come to the course.. its them, who are really interested in the subject who keep coming, those who really wont need it to pass the exam..
[14:08] <Andrew1986> i'm never a good teaching figure
[14:08] <Andrew1986> I'm normally scared of those that think they are smart
[14:09] <Andrew1986> they ask questions that seem to make good sense, but make no sense at all
[14:09] <Graf_Ithaka> oh humm.. I hope "my" students are happy with me as their TA, dont know if I'm a good teacher or not, I'm giving my best..
[14:10] <Andrew1986> my dream job would be a researcher but no teaching duties
[14:10] <Graf_Ithaka> good luck ;D
[14:10] <Andrew1986> no teaching duties = good
[14:10] <Graf_Ithaka> means going to the business sector for you ;)
[14:11] <Andrew1986> no
[14:11] <Andrew1986> I'll be in the academic sector, but I don't want to teach
[14:11] <Graf_Ithaka> okay probably its different from where you are from..
[14:13] <Andrew1986> did you know that after a short while in the (forgot the name) university, Einstein was lifted from teaching duties
[14:13] <Andrew1986> and he was only doing research work
[14:14] * mal`` has quit IRC (Client Quit)
[14:14] * mal`` has joined ##chemistry
[14:14] <Graf_Ithaka> no didnt know that.. actually I'm not focusing at those topics atm - primary target is studying now ;)
[14:14] <Andrew1986> if I ever become a professor, I hope I'll be so good that I won't be asked to teach
[14:15] <Graf_Ithaka> hehe ;)
[14:15] <Andrew1986> they say that teaching is social responsibility, but teaching is too hard
[14:15] <Andrew1986> and it destroys how you think
[14:17] <Graf_Ithaka> hmm i dont know.. you hold your lecture, you write your exams.. its probably just alot of time you got to invest but I dont think that it'll influence your way of thinking or anything..
[14:18] <Andrew1986> if you spend effort in teaching effectively it'll affect how you think
[14:19] <Andrew1986> so professors that teach very very well are usually not innovative researchers anymore
[14:19] <Graf_Ithaka> hm yep probably but as you say you dont like to teach I implied you wouldnt spend effort on teaching.. I know alot of profs who just hold their lectures regardless of anyone understanding whats going on..
[14:20] <Andrew1986> yes
[14:20] <Graf_Ithaka> and its right, they're known to be good researches
[14:20] <Andrew1986> yes
[14:20] <Graf_Ithaka> (never thought of it this way before..)
[14:21] <Andrew1986> I'd like to be one of those
[14:27] <Andrew1986> i'm going to sleep

[16:56] * Anna-Stina has quit IRC ("ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.0.14/2009082707]")
[16:57] <matt1234> anyone ?
[16:59] <The_Phoenix> meh a lil lazy lol
[16:59] <seba--> write first octane
[16:59] <seba--> then + O2
[16:59] <seba--> and at the end youget
[16:59] <seba--> H2O + CO2
[17:00] <The_Phoenix> CxHy + (x+(y/4)) -> xCO2 + yH2O
[17:01] <The_Phoenix> * CxHy + (x+(y/4))O2 -> xCO2 + yH2O
[17:02] <matt1234> C8H18 + (8+(18/4)O2 = 8CO2 + 18H2O?
[17:02] <matt1234> or
[17:02] <matt1234> C8H18 + 25/2O2 = 8CO2 + 18H2O?
[17:03] <The_Phoenix> well actually, 2C8H18 + 25O2 = 16CO2 + 36H2O is better
[17:03] <matt1234> is an oxidation reaction the same as simply balancing a chemical equation?
[17:03] <matt1234> oxygen isnt balanced
[17:04] <The_Phoenix> hmmmm
[17:05] <matt1234> thats all it is?
[17:05] <matt1234> how i thought there wwas more to it then taht, its just a balanced equation
[17:05] <matt1234> is this true
[17:05] <The_Phoenix> it should ideally balance
[17:05] <matt1234> half reactions are wher i split the molecule and show its charge?
[17:06] <The_Phoenix> sorry
[17:06] <The_Phoenix> it should be y/2
[17:06] <The_Phoenix> not 4
[17:07] <The_Phoenix> sorry i just woke up :P
[17:08] <matt1234> :)
[17:08] <matt1234> thank you
[17:12] <chill|out> =)
[17:12] <chill|out> hey The_Phoenix: she was not worth it!
[17:12] <chill|out> :)
[17:12] <The_Phoenix> lol hahaha... well yea chill|out
[17:12] <The_Phoenix> but duh hate being single :(
[17:12] * akafubu has joined ##chemistry
[17:12] * kaminix has quit IRC (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
[17:13] <chill|out> well yea. beeing single sux for you atm. but in the relationship the beeing together sux.
[17:14] <chill|out> some other times
[17:14] <chill|out> so enjoy your singlesness
[17:14] <chill|out> it will be sucking again soon enough
[17:14] <chill|out> ^^
[17:15] <chill|out> in both ways. in the end: she is not worth it^^
[17:15] <The_Phoenix> lol
[17:15] <The_Phoenix> well true enough chill|out thanks for being there buddy :D
[17:16] <chill|out> np at all. been there, done that, too. =)
[17:16] <chill|out> did she brake up?
[17:16] <chill|out> or did you?
[17:16] <chill|out> or "both" ?
[17:16] <chill|out> u think its final?
[17:17] <chill|out> are you sad about the fact, that you are now single, or pseudo-single?
[17:17] <chill|out> dont be.
[17:18] <chill|out> shit happens and anything you think of in this moment, is the splitup
[17:18] <chill|out> its ok for today and a week or two
[17:19] <chill|out> but dont let it get to you this hard. if she broke up with you, she is probably just not worth it. concentrate on yourself, let her beeing alone. dont think that "gf"-dependant would be my wiseass cvomment on this
[17:20] <chill|out> splitting up is hard, but sometimes its just the way it goes.. and whatever u think ATM, it will most likely be otherwise in near future.
[17:21] <The_Phoenix> hmmm.............
[17:21] <chill|out> what if u didnt split up yesterday? maybe you would still be in that halfassesd relationship
[17:22] <The_Phoenix> no buddy, am not worried about the breakup.
[17:22] <chill|out> did you or did she?
[17:22] <chill|out> yay
[17:22] <chill|out> way to go ?=)
[17:22] <The_Phoenix> just that am a bit feeling lonely.
[17:22] <chill|out> ah ok
[17:22] <The_Phoenix> shedid. :D
[17:22] <chill|out> i confused that
[17:22] <chill|out> she aint worth it11231
[17:22] <chill|out> ^^
[17:22] <The_Phoenix> yes lol i accept that...
[17:22] <chill|out> no u dont
[17:22] <chill|out> =)
[17:23] <chill|out> bc u fell now lonely
[17:23] <chill|out> dont fell that *fg*
[17:23] <chill|out> feel*
[17:23] <chill|out> bc u arent. obviously
[17:23] <The_Phoenix> hmm well chill|out .. it's not about that.. just that am the single among ma friends... :D
[17:23] <chill|out> a lone wolf. without the lone-wolfe-feeling?
[17:24] <chill|out> well anyone is a single even amongst his friends.
[17:24] <chill|out> nothinng to feel bad about
[17:24] <The_Phoenix> lol....
[17:24] <The_Phoenix> ok well
[17:24] <The_Phoenix> you won chill|out
[17:24] <The_Phoenix> :D
[17:24] <chill|out> it was a challenge?
[17:24] <chill|out> what did i win??
[17:25] <chill|out> a puff of air? =) wooohoo
[17:25] <The_Phoenix> lol...
[17:25] <The_Phoenix> yea it was a challenge :D
[17:25] <The_Phoenix> well u won my happiness and trust :D
[17:25] <chill|out> ok then. i won.
[17:25] <The_Phoenix> :D
[17:25] <chill|out> but dont trust anyone *fg*
[17:26] <chill|out> but yourself.
[17:26] <chill|out> trust is a tricky concept
[17:26] <chill|out> failing even in longtime friendships
[17:26] <The_Phoenix> lol...
[17:26] <The_Phoenix> :D
[17:26] <chill|out> :D
[17:26] <The_Phoenix> :D

[17:29] <chill|out> calc the moles
[17:29] <chill|out> and then apply the "gas rule" (aka 1 mole gas= 22,4 liter or 24 liter)
[17:29] <chill|out> trick is:
[17:29] <chill|out> hydrogen is H2
[17:30] <matt1234> so it 2.02 g/mol
[17:30] <matt1234> its^
[17:30] <The_Phoenix> zombo.com is that soe brainwashing site?
[17:30] <chill|out> so dont mix up molar weight of H and H2
[17:30] <matt1234> so its about half a mol
[17:30] <matt1234> is that right?
[17:31] <matt1234> and 1 mol occupys about 22.5 L
[17:31] <matt1234> so half a mol would occupy 11 L
[17:31] <matt1234> am i doing tht right chill|out :)
[17:31] <chill|out> ahm
[17:31] <The_Phoenix> chill|out: zombo.com is that mind washing site? am posting it on ma fb with 900 friends :D
[17:31] <chill|out> yes The_Phoenix
[17:31] <matt1234> is that a yes?
[17:31] <matt1234> lol
[17:32] <chill|out> ok u took 2 gram and did what?
[17:32] <chill|out> ->/molar weight?
[17:32] <matt1234> 1 gram / 2.02 g/mol = 0.5 mol
[17:32] <chill|out> sorry phone, i guess ur right i had to calc it
[17:32] <matt1234> sorry it would be :
[17:33] <matt1234> 1 gram / 1 mol/ 2.02 g = 0.5 mol
[17:33] <matt1234> hmm
[17:33] <matt1234> 1 gram * 1 mol/ 2.02 g = 0.5 mol
[17:33] <matt1234> tahts better
[17:33] <chill|out> kk
[17:33] * akafubu has quit IRC (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
[17:34] <matt1234> and since 1 mol occupys 22.5 L it makes sesnse that half a mol would be half the volunme?
[17:34] <chill|out> yep
[17:34] <matt1234> thank you :)
[17:35] <matt1234> im finally dojne this damn report
[17:39] <chill|out> np
[17:39] <chill|out> ok finished talking
[17:39] <chill|out> am if the question is 1 gram of H2 this is correct
[17:40] <chill|out> 0,5 mole H2 take 11.25L at SATP
[17:40] <chill|out> is it.
[17:41] <chill|out> also valid for 0,5 mole of H
[17:41] * Martinp23 has quit IRC ("Goodbye")
[17:42] <chill|out> but that qould render to 0,25mol of H2 pretty fast
[17:42] <chill|out> ahm
[17:42] * Martinp23 has joined ##chemistry
[17:42] <chill|out> [16:33] (matt1234): 1 gram * 1 mol/ 2.02 g = 0.5 mol
[17:42] <chill|out> [16:33] (chill|out): kk
[17:43] <chill|out> 1 mol H2 is ~2 grams
[17:43] <chill|out> H has atomic weight of 1.xxxx u
[17:44] <chill|out> 2 mol H is 1 mol H2 is ~2g.
[17:44] <chill|out> 2g / 2.xxxx g/mol is 1.
[17:45] <chill|out> 1 mole.. therefore 22,4L
[17:45] <chill|out> is this correct?

[17:45] <seba--> YAY
[17:45] <chill|out> yummy pizza ^^

[17:58] <chill|out> matt1234 ?
[17:59] * akafubu has joined ##chemistry
[17:59] <chill|out> or did u sent/closed that chapter in volume calc
[18:01] <chill|out> "1 gram of hydrogen" <- yould be one mole of H or 1 mole of H2. if its 1gram H its 1mole if its H2 its 2 gram.
[18:01] <chill|out> do you see the problem or am i off?
[18:02] <chill|out> so 1 gram of H2 has (2moles H) 1mole = 24L
[18:03] <chill|out> and 1 gram of H has 0.5 mol H2

[18:53] <Hotwire> chill|out: botsworth has been here ages
[18:54] <chill|out> but.. but.. but...
[18:54] <chill|out> he didnt resolve utubelinks before, didnt he/she? whatever sex the bot has
[18:55] <chill|out> my bots were female.
[18:55] <chill|out> they talked alot to each other, thats when i went with female names for them
[18:55] <Hotwire> he has always done youtube
[18:55] <chill|out> mmh
[18:55] <chill|out> i never spammed a utubelink in here?
[18:55] <Hotwire> well, as long as he's been here
[18:55] <chill|out> mmmmh nice
[18:55] <chill|out> ill start to spam then^^
[18:56] <Hotwire> it does some other stuff too
[18:56] <chill|out> any other useful things?
[18:56] <Hotwire> but i forget what :P
[18:56] <chill|out> does he have urls expansion or url shortening? wather?
[18:56] <Hotwire> its kinda not a complete bot
[18:56] <chill|out> weather?
[18:56] <chill|out> google?
[18:56] <chill|out> calcing?
[18:56] <chill|out> some of that?
[18:56] <Hotwire> it supplements another bot in the channel it was designed for
[18:57] <Hotwire> unfortunately the person who runs the other bot is too lazy to get it in here
[18:57] <chill|out> bot communication i uess
[18:57] <chill|out> aah hehe
[18:57] <chill|out> unfinished project..
[18:57] <chill|out> :)
[18:57] <chill|out> a wiki or google funkt would be nice for the channel
[18:58] <Hotwire> yeah
[18:58] <Hotwire> the other bot does that :P

[19:02] <chill|out> whats the second bot's nick? i want to PM spam him, so he gets his ass in the channel. oh wait. i think hes not on freenode. well give me his emailadress *g*
[19:02] <Hotwire> lol
[19:03] <chill|out> i miss my bots, they were smart channelbots. they could do really useful things to integrate the www into the IRC.
[19:03] <chill|out> and vice versa
[19:03] <chill|out> also relaying channels on different networks and channels
[19:03] <chill|out> dand combinations
[19:03] <chill|out> 1 smartbot connecting 3 relyaing bots
[19:04] <chill|out> interesting things u can achieve with a small botnet.. in a positive botnet-meaning
[19:04] <chill|out> not the DDoS botnets u might think about right now
[19:05] <chill|out> ^^
[19:06] <chill|out> well, if the owner of the missing bot needs someone to care for it.. id have some time until april
[19:06] <chill|out> gimme a call^^
[19:06] <chill|out> i like scripting tcl. because i can partly understand that^^
[19:06] <chill|out> its not rocket science to make a bot a smartbot =)
[19:07] <Hotwire> relaying bots are _so_ annoying
[19:07] <chill|out> depends on what u want to do, surely =)
[19:07] <Hotwire> and its scripted in php, and i doubt he'll give the code out
[19:07] <chill|out> oh naw i dont like php that much
[19:07] <chill|out> i thought it was an eggdrop bot
[19:07] <chill|out> in tcl
[19:08] <Hotwire> i never understood the point in them, why not just join the fucking channel yourself
[19:08] <chill|out> u mean a different relaying than i mean i guess
[19:08] <Hotwire> what do you mean?
[19:08] <chill|out> if you want to connect a channel between different irc networks
[19:09] <chill|out> u need relaying between the networks
[19:09] <chill|out> easily done via 1 eggdrop connecting to all /unpractical/ or use 3 bots. 1 bot on each network
[19:09] <chill|out> and another one relaying between the bots.
[19:11] <chill|out> so if u want to go to 1 of the networks
[19:11] <chill|out> u can sonnect to the third. and talk in both nets and the both channels
[19:14] <Hotwire> but why not just join the channels you want to be in?
[19:15] <chill|out> ok special situation:
[19:15] <chill|out> sec, phone
[19:20] <chill|out> ahm it was this scenario:
[19:20] <chill|out> we had multiple gameservers
[19:20] <chill|out> each gameserver had an own bot
[19:21] <chill|out> to relay chat in the game to a private irc network,
[19:21] <chill|out> the channel the fgamers were was quekent
[19:21] <chill|out> due to several quakenet limitations
[19:21] <chill|out> the bots couldnt be used in quakente directly
[19:22] <chill|out> due to massive textflood flrom 4-6 gameservers to IRC and vie versa
[19:22] <chill|out> so the gameservers were connected to the private nat
[19:22] <chill|out> net*
[19:22] <chill|out> and the privatenet was relayed to quakenet via bots.
[19:23] <chill|out> for each chat on the server the gameserverbot sends to the network1, collects all servers, sends via botlink to the bot in the other network into each respective channels
[19:24] <chill|out> but not only chat-relay
[19:24] <chill|out> but commands relay.
[19:24] <chill|out> so tto control all gameserverbots each
[19:24] <chill|out> i just connect to the commandandcontrol-bot. i can reach all channels, networks and gameservers in ONE bot.
[19:25] <chill|out> this is where the relaying was really useful.
[19:25] <Hotwire> oh
[19:25] <chill|out> cant be done without some relying eggdrops that fast ^^
[19:28] <chill|out> in this setup i jsut could use a command
[19:28] <chill|out> on all servers at once
[19:28] <Hotwire> i've seen people before just using them to relay chat
[19:28] <chill|out> or jsut 1 or ttwo gamerevers, their bots or all the channels and chat from 1 machine. ah good times. i srsly miss my bots =)
[19:29] <Hotwire> basically because their channel sucks, and there's no one active in it
