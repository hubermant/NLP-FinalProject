[01:38] <Animal> i'll buy a new xbox + kinect bundle easily if one shows up
[01:38] <ryaxnb> im tired of rumors ms should announce price :(

[01:39] <Jide> who else is tonight?
[01:39] <MrPing1000> The only way I'd own a 360 is if I'd have been at the conference
[01:39] <Wes_> For everyone on the paraguay flight: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Madridexpo/Misc/fotot.jpg
[01:39] <ryaxnb> in my mind this doomed it to eyetoy style failnure
[01:39] <darkh23> the main page gamestop has dedicated to it lists no prices until you click.....I find telling that they aren't completely sure yet
[01:39] <duckroll> Ubisoft
[01:39] <Mandoric> idk
[01:39] <DrForester> I bet MS was goign to annoucne price then saw reaction alst night to the rumor of a $100+ price
[01:39] <duckroll> in 80 mins
[01:39] <Jide> actiblizzard?
[01:39] <Mandoric> damned if they do and they're more expensive than ps3
[01:39] <Acosta> pass
[01:39] <Old_Lace> what game is this showing on the youtube stream?
[01:39] <Narayan> I hope Ubisoft screws up again.
[01:39] <Mandoric> damned if they don't, it's nonstandard
[01:39] <MrPing1000> Thats her husband beside her WEs_
[01:39] <MrPing1000> haha
[01:39] <DrForester> is there a .gifs thread yet?
[01:39] <Mandoric> if bach and allard had stayed
[01:39] <Mandoric> i'd say they were going to make it standard, take that risk, and maybe win
[01:39] <Rorschach> I got 500 problems 
[01:39] <pj> cod doesnt seem too bad
[01:40] <Somnia> haha
[01:40] <Strider2K99> So BC2 Vietnam is an actual expansion, as in you need BC2 to play it?
[01:40] <Rorschach> but a bitch ain't one amirite
[01:40] <Somnia> they took the preorders for the system bundles down
[01:40] <Orbi> [08:38:51] <Wes_> For everyone on the paraguay flight: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Madridexpo/Misc/fotot.jpg <--- TITS
[01:40] <Bob_Coffee> Wes:wow,id love to be the cell phone in that pic.
[01:40] <Mandoric> but the departures mean either a) the company has lost faith
[01:40] <Somnia> but the main page for kinect is still up @ 149.99
[01:40] <Mandoric> or b) the division has lost faith
[01:40] <Mandoric> and either way it's not goijng to be a complete relaunch
[01:40] <Somnia> gamestop put this up

[01:40] <Wes_> Sarah Palin plans trip to UK to meet 'political heroine' Margaret Thatcher
[01:40] <Mandoric> they always put that
[01:40] <Wes_> hahaha
[01:40] <darkh23> exactly
[01:41] <Mandoric> there have been like ten fucking retailer leaks
[01:41] <Jide> haha wes
[01:41] <Jide> lol
[01:41] <darkh23> they just want to get some HAWT PREORDERS 
[01:41] <Mandoric> not one has been under $149
[01:41] <ryaxnb> im tired of stupid speculation.
[01:41] <stump> Wes_: given that maggie has been half-baked since her series of strokes, i'm sure they'll be roughly on the same intellectual level now!
[01:41] <Expy> the new xbox design also ressembles those portable Wester Digital one touch HDDs
[01:41] * thatbox has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[01:41] <Mandoric> and retailers benefit by UNDERshooting
[01:41] <Mandoric> hgetting a preorder
[01:41] <Expy> but not as portable
[01:41] <ryaxnb> didnt one guy at ms say over $100
[01:41] * Killthee has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[01:41] <Somnia> every retailer thinks itll be 150+
[01:41] <ryaxnb> under $200

[01:41] * Enkidu has quit IRC (Client exited)
[01:41] <Jide> that poor dude talking about the sims
[01:41] <Jide> lol
[01:41] <EGM92> 140$ for an attachment is a big fuck you
[01:41] <ryaxnb> y'know what? MS is screwed.
[01:41] <EGM92> what is the Move price?
[01:42] <Wes_> exactly stump. her advisors probably told her Maggie was the most unlikely to be able to physically slap her when she arrives
[01:42] <stump> god that was terrible, the sims section was a close second to Cameron's rant last year
[01:42] <BossG> it says, fuck you, get a job...hehe
[01:42] <Vic> even $99 is too much for a freaking camera
[01:42] <Expy> sony said entire move bundle should be less than 100
[01:42] <stump> EGM92: Not priced yet, but it seems like $59 for a controller, $19 for a subcontroller, $30 for a camera, possibly $99 for all three together
[01:42] <EGM92> entire bundle? 
[01:42] <ryaxnb> sony said it will be :)
[01:42] * Killthee has joined #ga
[01:42] <EGM92> what's inside the bundle?
[01:42] <azentium> subcontroller?
[01:42] <darkh23> those 3 things
[01:42] * seantos has quit IRC (Quit: seantos)
[01:42] <MrPing1000> I was going to say Thatcher would kick Palin's ass mentally, but she has dementia so it'll probably be an even playing field
[01:42] <ryaxnb> so sony <$99 confirmed.
[01:42] <EGM92> ok
[01:42] <stump> azentium: the nunchuk
[01:42] * Hellcrow has quit IRC (Quit: )
[01:42] <EGM92> well I already have an eyetoy.
[01:42] <ryaxnb> that will compete quite well.
[01:43] <Expy> Move+navigator+eye
[01:43] <azentium> stump: oh ok, thanks
[01:43] <HK-47> Ping: Thats overestimating Palin
[01:43] <EGM92> or ps3 eye
[01:43] <Expy> o.O
[01:43] <ryaxnb> EGM92, well then you ll save a few
[01:43] <Mandoric> $150 ?150 \17480 $B!r(B125
[01:43] <Mandoric> total
[01:43] <ryaxnb> my guess is youll get it for $70 or so
[01:43] <ryaxnb> since you dont need the eye
[01:43] <Mandoric> that second one should have been a euro mark
[01:43] <Expy> prob 99$ with a game
[01:43] <TheNatural> Ubi Soft's conference in about an hour .. jeez I hope they show some FPS's
[01:43] <Hyoushi> z time

[01:43] <threi> man GAF is in bad shape right now
[01:43] <stump> that's what 10k users will do :p
[01:43] <EGM92> I wonder how natal will RROD lol
[01:43] <HK-47> its your fault threi
[01:43] <MrPing1000> ubisoft's conference will be 80% games for kids and non games
[01:43] <threi> sorry :(
[01:44] * thatbox has joined #ga
[01:44] <MrPing1000> was last year
[01:44] <EGM92> as well as the slim 
[01:44] <ryaxnb> EGM92, not funny :(
[01:44] <KimiNewt> so what
[01:44] <Mandoric> move probably $60 wand, $100 wand/nunchuck/eyetoy, $20 nunchuck
[01:44] <Bob_Coffee> Imagine:Confrencez.
[01:44] <azentium> oh god, there's going to be a sonic riders kinect game
[01:44] <KimiNewt> what 'core' game could they possibly make that'd be exciting
[01:44] <Mandoric> nintendo parity
[01:44] <KimiNewt> seriously
[01:44] <Mandoric> mostly
[01:44] <Orin_Docks> Admiral Evilore. Lock the World Cup thread and divert its power to the E3 threads
[01:44] <ryaxnb> natal is now Kinect
[01:44] <KimiNewt> no one's making new IPs
[01:44] <stump> Sure they are. EA's conference had several!
[01:44] <ryaxnb> core motion games are all going for Move.
[01:44] * Himuro has quit IRC (Quit: )
[01:44] <KimiNewt> Several?
[01:44] <Luckett> welcome to gun club
[01:44] <HK-47> Imagine: Skittlez
[01:44] <Luckett> get yer gun
[01:44] <KimiNewt> Bulletstorm and?
[01:44] <ryaxnb> kinect is less hardcore then move.
[01:44] * Axord has joined #ga
[01:44] <Mandoric> move is gonna be a shitty wii portbox
[01:44] <MrPing1000> Imagine: Imagination
[01:45] <KimiNewt> Imagine: Imagine: Babiez
[01:45] <Luckett> kinect has absolutely 0 hardcore aspects
[01:45] <Flachmatuch> yeah that too mandoric but still
[01:45] <Mandoric> that sony will abandon after their one push, like eyetoy
[01:45] <Mandoric> on the other hand
[01:45] <Vic> I excepted way more from EA.
[01:45] <MrPing1000> Imagine: All the people
[01:45] <Flachmatuch> if just a couple of shooters support Move I'll be ok
[01:45] <Mandoric> a shitty wii portbox that';s abandoned like eyetoy
[01:45] <darkh23> move will have strong first party support and a bunch of wii ports....sounds familiar
[01:45] <ryaxnb> Mandoric, they claim all new ps3 games will be on move.
[01:45] <Flachmatuch> I'm getting really really by re4
[01:45] <ryaxnb> ALL new games
[01:45] <Mandoric> will be a moderate profitmaking success that can be built off of with the ps4
[01:45] <ryaxnb> :/
[01:45] <ryaxnb> ms makes no such claim
[01:45] <Flachmatuch> really bored
[01:46] <Mandoric> they've claimed move features for first party
[01:46] <stump> KimiNewt: Oh, I guess Spare Parts wasn't at the conference, true.
[01:46] <Mandoric> mostly camera-related
[01:46] * Hyoushi has joined #ga
[01:46] <KimiNewt> What's Spare Parts?

[01:46] <Hyoushi> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[01:46] <ryaxnb> i predict every new sports game will support move
[01:46] <ryaxnb> thirdparty, firstparty or not
[01:46] <Mandoric> sports maybe
[01:46] <Strider2K99> I'm going to miss Sony conference tomorrow due to dentist appointment :(
[01:46] <Mandoric> idk, sony COULD be dumb enough to make it an approval checkmark
[01:46] <RagnarokX> I can't wait for tomorrow's LIVE delayed coverage of the Nintendo and Sony conferences
[01:46] <Mandoric> sony is very dumb
[01:47] <Hyoushi> http://inapcache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bigpicture/fifa_06_14/f16_23804877.jpg
[01:47] <threi> brazil vs NK
[01:47] <threi> thats gunna suck
[01:47] <Hyoushi> it's gonna be awesome
[01:47] <Mandoric> but the halfhearted 'welp w/e port your wii games plz' approach
[01:47] <threi> and I have to step out right when it's finishing
[01:47] <Flachmatuch> i think if it works as well as wiimote for shooters, it might be quite successful because of competition
[01:47] <Mandoric> is by far the best business approach even though it's completely accidental
[01:47] <Expy> Mandoric: Sony said they didn't want shitty wii ports
[01:47] <ryaxnb> i believe fps will have move support.
[01:47] <Expy> Besdies
[01:47] <ryaxnb> it seems so natural for fps.
[01:47] <Expy> Sony has a hgue enoguh first party
[01:47] <ryaxnb> have you tried MP3?
[01:48] <Flachmatuch> more natural for third person
[01:48] <Expy> They've already got SOCOM 4...
[01:48] <Flachmatuch> like DS2
[01:48] <Flachmatuch> hehe
[01:48] <Expy> probably Dead Space 2
[01:48] <ryaxnb> killzone3 will be awesome with move.
[01:48] <Mandoric> Sony > St--stupid developers! It's not like I made Move just for your Wii ports or anything!
[01:48] <Orin_Docks> Don't say another Goddamn BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. Up until now, I've been polite. If you say anything else - one word - I will kill myself. And when my tainted spirit finds its destination, I will topple the master of that dark place. From my black throne, I will lash together a machine of bone and blood, and fueled by my hatred for you this fear engine will bore a hole between this world and that one. When it begins, you will hear the 
[01:48] <threi> u mad
[01:48] <Luckett> i wonder if Nu Ape Escape will be any good
[01:48] <Somnia> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[01:48] <ryaxnb> there are lots of games move could be used with,much more than kinect
[01:49] <ryaxnb> im having a hard time even imagining a football (american) game using kinect.
[01:49] <Gattsu25> Hey Orin_Docks 
[01:49] <Hyoushi> http://inapcache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bigpicture/fifa_06_14/f34_23822939.jpg
[01:49] <Hyoushi> nice hitler stache
[01:49] <kassatsu> gaf is lagging like crazy
[01:49] <ryaxnb> easy time imagining it using move.
[01:49] * vulvaschool has joined #ga
[01:49] <ryaxnb> and that is a very simple task..
[01:49] <HadesGigas> I find it funny that we've seen 3 Sar Wars games this weekend, and the only one that was gameplay footage was the kinect shit
[01:50] <ryaxnb> now go to something like FPS or Zelda-style and Move seems great but Kinect- not so much
[01:50] <Mandoric> was that even gameplay footage
[01:50] <Mandoric> idk!
[01:50] <Bob_Coffee> sars wars.
[01:50] <Mandoric> we saw no game player
[01:50] <Narayan> I hope Child of Eden has Move support.
[01:50] <Hyoushi> z for real
[01:50] <HadesGigas> it was footage of gameplay, not of the game being played by the person at the event

[01:50] <Narayan> Metal Gear Solid Rising, too.
[01:50] <ryaxnb> after all wii has been proven to work with fps and action adventure games.
[01:50] <Mandoric> i'm being pessimistic =P
[01:50] <ryaxnb> move the same (or better)
[01:50] <Mandoric> man
[01:50] <dead> I hope Rising has a cooking mini game
[01:50] <Mandoric> metal gear rising
[01:50] <vulvaschool> rip video games
[01:50] <stump> Narayan: it /looks/ like it does
[01:51] <dead> to put that watermelon slicing to good use
[01:51] <Mandoric> should be on the wii
[01:51] <Bob_Coffee> metal gear cooking.
[01:51] <kassatsu> Child of Eden should be at ubi right?
[01:51] <Bob_Coffee> tactical slicing action.
[01:51] <Narayan> Better than Kinect.
[01:51] <threi> you know
[01:51] <Old_Lace> what is child of eden?
[01:51] <Mandoric> it's the only system with sane controls for it
[01:51] <Expy> ubi at 4:30pst?
[01:51] <threi> that would make an awesome cooking mama game
[01:51] <dead> well
[01:51] <Narayan> Old_Lace: Rez 2.
[01:51] <azentium> 5:00 PST
[01:51] <dead> it could work with Movie
[01:51] <dead> err Move
[01:51] <Expy> kk
[01:51] <Old_Lace> oh
[01:51] <Mandoric> no, it couldn't
[01:51] <dead> why not
[01:51] <Mandoric> if you have both hands on the move
[01:51] <dead> isnt it the same shit as wii
[01:51] <EGM92> is it possible to batteries for cordless phones for cheap???
[01:51] <Mandoric> for a proper sword grip
[01:51] <Flachmatuch> ?
[01:51] <Mandoric> you can't move
[01:51] <Mandoric> the wii has the dpad
[01:52] <Mandoric> under your right thumb
[01:52] <Flachmatuch> that's true hehehe
[01:52] <dead> oh
[01:52] <dead> eh
[01:52] <dead> either way, fuck waggle
[01:52] <Flachmatuch> not that you can use ut
[01:52] <Flachmatuch> it
[01:52] <threi> lol
[01:52] <ryaxnb> what about the dpad under your left thumb of the sub controller
[01:52] <ryaxnb> ?
[01:52] <Flachmatuch> fuck waggle but aiming is awesome
[01:52] <Narayan> It would be sick if PS3 got a HD Sin & Punishment 2.
[01:52] <Mandoric> that's the sub controller
[01:52] <Mandoric> if you have your left hand on that
[01:52] <ryaxnb> still counts IMHO
[01:52] <Mandoric> it's not on the move
[01:52] <threi> IR pointer has been the best innovation to controllers in a long time
[01:52] <ryaxnb> you need to.
[01:52] <Flachmatuch> works if you have 3 hands
[01:52] <Narayan> You could never do that shit on Kinect.
[01:52] <Mandoric> and your grip is all wrong and terribvle
[01:52] <ryaxnb> Narayan, true true
[01:52] <BJ> 58 pages for the EA conference thread? sheesh

[01:53] <Acosta> fuck you
[01:53] * olubode_iPhone has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[01:53] <ryaxnb> imagine a boxing game with one to one precision on either kinect or move.
[01:53] <Expy> lol
[01:53] <Mandoric> all the important part of gripping is on the left hand anyway
[01:53] <ryaxnb> would be pretty cool.
[01:53] <threi> waggle is suplimental but the IR pointer really opens up possibilities 
[01:53] * vulvaschool has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[01:53] <Flachmatuch> why didn't ms  just copy the ir pointing in the wiimote
[01:53] <ryaxnb> i think this could revolutionize boxing and wrestling games.
[01:53] <Flachmatuch> i'd so love to play Halo CE with pointing
[01:53] <Mandoric> kinect boxing is going to be the really impressive launch title.

[01:53] <Flachmatuch> :-(
[01:54] <TheNatural> bye bye PAC 16
[01:54] <Flachmatuch> i think they're mistaken though
[01:54] <Mandoric> konami had a similar boxing arcade game
[01:54] <Mandoric> it was awesome
[01:54] <Flachmatuch> they'd need games for that and they don't have them

[01:55] <Expy> XD
[01:55] <Expy> Gonna*
[01:55] <ryaxnb> way back when (first motion control)
[01:55] <Mandoric> uforce was bad at trauforce was bad at tracking
[01:55] <Narayan> How much is Move rumored to be?
[01:55] <Expy> sub 100
[01:55] <Expy> not rumored
[01:55] <Expy> confirmed
[01:55] <ryaxnb> well of course, it wasnt great, but for the time... it was neat.
[01:55] * threi has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[01:55] <Mandoric> it was kinda neat even then
[01:55] <Narayan> I'll bite if it has slikc integration.

[01:55] <Mandoric> but hell
[01:55] <Mandoric> honestly

[01:56] * Jonah has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[01:56] <Mandoric> they could completely phone in move/kinect boxing
[01:56] <Somnia> move with dead space 2 could work really well
[01:56] <Mandoric> and it'd still be pretty awesome
[01:56] <Flachmatuch> yep yep
[01:56] <ryaxnb> i dont know
[01:56] <ryaxnb> wii sports boxing wasnt great
[01:56] <ryaxnb> you need one to one control
[01:56] <Flachmatuch> hehe depends
[01:56] <Expy> it sucked
[01:56] <Narayan> Immersion is easier when the control is tangible.

[01:56] <Mandoric> you need the illusion of 1:1
[01:56] <Luckett> hahahha
[01:57] <Mandoric> while backing it up with assist
[01:57] <Luckett> the walking around a car segment
[01:57] <ryaxnb> good point
[01:57] <Expy> the illusion of 1:1 = not you playing
[01:57] <Luckett> my god that was real
[01:57] <Luckett> that was a real thing
[01:57] <Expy> but the software playing for you
[01:57] <ryaxnb> but wii sports boxing failed at that
[01:57] <Mandoric> 1:1 just reminds the player that they're a fat uncoordinated nerd
[01:57] * vulvaschool has joined #ga
[01:57] <Expy> and that they ened to improve
[01:57] <Expy> :P

[01:57] <Wes_> The Child of Eden trailer is freaking awesome.
[01:57] <Mandoric> wii sports boxing was iffy
[01:57] <ryaxnb> prepare for ubisoft dancing titles in 1 2 3
[01:57] <Narayan> I like the music.
[01:57] <vulvaschool> anything worth caring about for ubi?
[01:57] <Narayan> I don't know why people are knocking it.
[01:57] <syllogism> <3 gabe
[01:57] <Mandoric> but a slightly refined punch-out would be great
[01:58] <DrForester> mandoric link?
[01:58] <Expy> plus in kinect boxing
[01:58] <Flachmatuch> boxing was the crappiest of the five but i still had friends who loved it
[01:58] <Expy> ur fighting avatars
[01:58] <Expy> lol
[01:58] <Narayan> vulvaschool: Beyond Good & Evil 2, but if it doesn't show - then Ubisoft can kiss their own asses goodbye.
[01:58] <Unison> ubi starting?
[01:58] <ryaxnb> punch out was fun
[01:58] <GaimeGuy> MEEBLE
[01:58] <Mandoric> and, like i said, konami did a wonderful arcade implem,entation
[01:58] <ryaxnb> just cause of the variety
[01:58] * HandsomeHomeless has joined #ga
[01:58] <Mandoric> what am i supposed to link to
[01:58] <darkh23> as shitty as natal looks....$150 is still cheaper than Move is gonna be for a couple players and only goes up from there (especially if you want dual wands for some games)   ...maybe that is microsoft's convoluted thinking if that price is accurate  "WELL SHIT GUYZ WE CAN'T GET LESS MONEY FOR OURS" lolz
[01:58] <HandsomeHomeless> fuuuu
[01:58] <HandsomeHomeless> thought my parents' computer's video card died
[01:58] <DrForester> err
[01:58] <Expy> <darkh23> as shitty as natal looks....$150 is still cheaper than Move is gonna be for a couple players 
[01:58] <Somnia> ya dark but consumers dont think that way
[01:58] <GaimeGuy> hello handsome
[01:58] <Expy> ????
[01:58] <HandsomeHomeless> turns out that may not have been the case :|
[01:58] <DrForester> Wes.  Link to trailer?
[01:58] <ryaxnb> darkh23, sorta.
[01:58] <kassatsu> Currently Active Users: 7396 ~__~ almost 4.5k guests
[01:59] <Expy> how is 150$ cheaper
[01:59] <darkh23> read what I wrote
[01:59] <HandsomeHomeless> gaime: computer powers up but doesn't do anything after that. help.
[01:59] <ryaxnb> darkh23, but darkh23 what about quality of hardcore games?
[01:59] <darkh23> instead of having instant reaction
[01:59] <Narayan> Does Move require an EyeToy?
[01:59] <kassatsu> 'bulletstorm is the best game at e3 so far its the god of war for fps games gangsta" lol hiphopgamer
[01:59] <DrForester> Exp really?
[01:59] <ryaxnb> move is kinda better at hardcore
[01:59] <Somnia> most consumers wont look at what itll cost them for multiple users theyll worry about extra remotes later 
[01:59] <Somnia> yes narayan
[01:59] <Somnia> but therell be a bundle with eye
[01:59] <Flachmatuch> narayan: pseye but it's in the $100 i think
[01:59] <Expy> for single player expereince
[01:59] <Expy> it's 150
[01:59] <DrForester> Sony can possibly price move over Wii controllers
[01:59] <Expy> lol
[01:59] <Flachmatuch> *required
[02:00] <HandsomeHomeless> gaime: seems it could be a CPU issue :|
[02:00] <DrForester> and those are $what?  $7o for contorller and nunchuck?
[02:00] <darkh23> I didn't say anythign about quality hardcore games....I'm just joking about that their possibly justification could be
[02:00] <DrForester> Sany just cant be that stupid
[02:00] <Somnia> wii remotes are 39 without motion and 54 with motion
[02:00] <Somnia> and 19 for nunchuck
[02:00] <darkh23> touchy touchy
[02:00] <Somnia> I see move remotes being 39
[02:00] <DrForester> Somina %0 with motion
[02:00] <Bob_Coffee> $70 is for Wiimote+motion plus + chuck.
[02:00] <Mandoric> $39 is low
[02:00] <Mandoric> they';re gonna aim around m+
[02:00] <stump> Move is gonna be 49/54 for the remote, 19 for the nunchuk, I'd virtually guarantee it.

[02:00] <ryaxnb> the move one.
[02:01] <Wes_> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[02:01] <Mandoric> i'm slightly more pessimistic than stump on the actual wand, but yeah that
[02:01] <Mandoric> $99 wand/chuck/cam
[02:01] <Somnia> narayan
[02:01] <Somnia> as long as the eye can see the ball
[02:01] <Somnia> it works
[02:01] <Narayan> Sick.
[02:01] <syllogism> shockingly skilotonn doesn't think the ms conference was that bad
[02:01] <DrForester> Gamestop:  "We'll charge $5 fo teh privlege of buying form us"
[02:01] <Narayan> If it's $99. I will definitely get it.
[02:01] <Flachmatuch> i kind of hope the casual MS/Sony stuff bombs and the Move core stuff will be successful :-D
[02:01] <ryaxnb> i think ms will bomb
[02:01] <alr1ght> OMG. 360 Not so slim has a powerbrick.... lol
[02:01] <Flachmatuch> and with this i mean pointing
[02:01] <Somnia> ya its suppose to be 99 for eye, move and a game
[02:01] <ryaxnb> people need a control. and its too expensive.
[02:01] <Somnia> or something around that
[02:02] * threi-laptop has joined #ga
[02:02] <kassatsu> lol ea ceo 
[02:02] <kassatsu> quoting that girl
[02:02] <Narayan> Move has a lot of potential because 1.) It's a tangible controller that gives feedback. 2.) Developers are familiar with the Wii. 3.) Sony has KILLER first-party support.
[02:02] <Expy> alr1ght: Kinect has one too, for older 360s
[02:02] <kassatsu> g4 has to dump
[02:02] <alr1ght> yay for ms engineers
[02:02] <Somnia> Socom 4 video shows how accurate the remote is too
[02:02] <Flachmatuch> Somnia: sadly not
[02:02] <ryaxnb> Narayan, my feelings exactly
[02:02] <Somnia> which is on youtube.com/e3 right now
[02:02] <Somnia> did you watch the new video flach?
[02:02] <Somnia> that came out today
[02:02] <Flachmatuch> or rather, i haven't seen that
[02:03] <Flachmatuch> oh no
[02:03] <ryaxnb> especially after how much i love my wii <3
[02:03] <DrForester> this youtube e3 channlel is excellent
[02:03] <DrForester> im impressed
[02:03] <Somnia> ya
[02:03] <Somnia> its showing socom right now
[02:03] <Somnia> from today
[02:03] <Narayan> Heck yeah. It's the only stream I'm following.
[02:03] <Flachmatuch> y43eah it works very well on this shitty pc with this shitty shitty internet connection
[02:03] <Narayan> It's really IGN, but still. Great stuff.
[02:03] <ryaxnb> youtube e3 FTW
[02:04] <Flachmatuch> ARGH looks like i missed it
[02:04] <stump> I used GT and it was good
[02:04] <Flachmatuch> even though it was streaming in the background
[02:04] <Somnia> I can link you a video flach
[02:04] <Flachmatuch> please do
[02:04] <Flachmatuch> hehe
[02:04] <azentium> IGN keeps looping the same four videos between the conferences

[02:04] <Narayan> Microfail.
[02:04] <Yann> socom does look pretty accurate with move
[02:05] <Somnia> it looks much better graphically than I thought it would too
[02:05] <Narayan> I'm not a hater or anything, but Microsoft pretty much has nothing.
[02:05] <Narayan> Reach. That's it.

[02:10] <Narayan> Nintendo, too. But not many people take them too seriously.

[02:11] <ryaxnb> they are so cool
[02:11] <Luckett> dat sensor
[02:11] <jman2050> can't believe MS pulled a Saturn then bribed the game journos in the same breah
[02:11] <jman2050> breath
[02:11] <Flachmatuch> hehe your philosophy course did a complex game world simulation and a model for predicting the outcome of that simulation?
[02:11] <Luckett> i notice MS didnt acknowledge any of the leaks
[02:11] <Luckett> just to show how rehearsed and robotic the whole presentation was
[02:11] <ryaxnb> Narayan, i dare say nintendo has it more down. not having a dpad  on the main controller is  a grievous error IMO
[02:12] <syllogism> "You can go anywhere! Look at that water!
[02:12] <ryaxnb> nevertheless, im excited for move.
[02:12] <Flachmatuch> the dpad is unusable on the wiimote though
[02:12] <ryaxnb> its good for non-motion-controlled games like NSMBwii with just a touch of motion control
[02:12] <Flachmatuch> yeah
[02:12] * minty has joined #ga
[02:12] <Narayan> You guys think it's a fair bet that The Last Guardian will use Move?

[02:13] <Expy> doubt it
[02:13] <vulvaschool> shut up narayan

[02:13] <Expy> LBP2 though might
[02:13] <Narayan> ryaxnb: I didn't know Move didn't have d-pad on the main. That's weird.
[02:13] <Expy> lolol
[02:13] * Killthee has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[02:13] <HK-47> I think the concept was interesting, Flach, but he dragged it on and didnt do much with it
[02:13] <Narayan> Or -- doesn't, rather.
[02:14] <Narayan> Watch them demo TLG with Move.
[02:14] <Flachmatuch> well yeah
[02:14] <ryaxnb> Narayan,  it is
[02:14] <Flachmatuch> but it was like 3 minutes and everyone was already whining
[02:14] <ryaxnb> Narayan, its on the navigation/sub/nunchuk controller
[02:14] <Flachmatuch> :-D
[02:14] <Flachmatuch> and the modeling part was interesting
[02:14] <HK-47> lol yeah I noticed.  Dudebros only for E3 lol
[02:14] <Narayan> Then what's the difference between Wii and Move then?
[02:15] <GaimeGuy> Move is dildo shaped
[02:15] <ryaxnb> well, sony cclaims youll only need one controller
[02:15] <GaimeGuy> at least, moreso than the wii
[02:15] <ryaxnb> hows that possible when the subcontroller contains the dpad?
[02:15] <HK-47> Better than another out of the loop professor waxing on about Second Life though XD
[02:15] <Narayan> Ah. I get it.
[02:15] <threi-laptop> wii = camera is on the controller, lights are on your tv
[02:15] <ryaxnb> worse, only 2 players can play if subcontrollers are used.
[02:15] <threi-laptop> move = camera is on your tv, lights are on your controller
[02:15] <stump> HK-47: hahahaha
[02:15] <Flachmatuch> HK-47: hehehehe
[02:15] <ryaxnb> compare to 4 without, and 4 on wii with or without.

[02:16] <ryaxnb> so, for instance, a four player NSMBwii will be impossible
[02:16] <Flachmatuch> but 4 player is needed more for casual stuff, which i'm not interested in hehe
[02:16] <ryaxnb> :(
[02:16] <Flachmatuch> oh shit
[02:16] <Somnia> unless you have 4 moves and 4 subs
[02:16] <Somnia> lol
[02:16] <Flachmatuch> or 4 ds3s
[02:16] <ryaxnb> Somnia, thats not supported.

[02:17] <ryaxnb> max 4 controllers overall according to sony
[02:17] <Wes_> The BBC was investigating the possibility of transmitting an alternative "vuvuzela free" version of its World Cup coverage tonight, as the fierce debate over the buzz of the horn looked set to be heading for football grounds all over Britain.
[02:17] <ryaxnb> including subs.
[02:17] <GaimeGuy> Move is basically sony's way of copying the wiimote without violating a patent
[02:17] <Somnia> hm never read that
[02:17] <GaimeGuy> by doing it in the opposite way
[02:17] <Narayan> ryaxnb: Think they'll patch it?
[02:17] <bufbaf> http://theartofjeremyrock.com/Reggie1.jpg
[02:17] <Somnia> by doing it better gaime?
[02:17] <bufbaf> oh neogaf :)
[02:17] <ryaxnb> Narayan, hopefully.
[02:17] <ryaxnb> most people only need 2 anyway.
[02:17] <threi-laptop> lmao @ the guile theme vid
[02:17] * syllogism has quit IRC (Quit: )
[02:17] <ryaxnb> but for the mario kart and NSMBWii and fighting games, 4 can be handy.
[02:17] <Luckett> hahahah Skilotonn threat is amazing
[02:17] <threi-laptop> its not better
[02:17] <Flachmatuch> Somnia: they need a lot more technology for move to work as well as wiimote pointing
[02:17] <Luckett> "I hope you all don't suicide over the next two conferences tomorrow, because guess what? You're going to get double what you saw today, and you don't even know if it'll be a good dose or not..."
[02:17] <threi-laptop> its a different approach
[02:17] <Flachmatuch> but it'll be able to do a lot more
[02:18] <jman2050> threi: the dancing is almost on beat
[02:18] <jman2050> I'm dying
[02:18] <Flachmatuch> absolute 3d positioning
[02:18] <Flachmatuch> and a lot more accuracy
[02:18] <threi-laptop> guile theme goes with everything
[02:18] <Flachmatuch> much better technology
[02:18] <ryaxnb> Flachmatuch, agreed
[02:18] <jman2050> with no real practical advantage
[02:18] <ryaxnb> the absolute makes me excited for boxing, wrestling, fighting games
[02:18] <Orin_Docks> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVogg_0Hhus
[02:18] <jman2050> which isn't a bad thing!
[02:18] <Orin_Docks> HOT
[02:18] <jman2050> but it isn't really innovative
[02:18] <ryaxnb> jman2050, boxing games?
[02:18] <ryaxnb> fighting games?
[02:18] <Flachmatuch> nope
[02:18] <ryaxnb> jman2050, no its not. but its better.
[02:19] <Narayan> Not fighting games like VF5.
[02:19] <Flachmatuch> but i'm not looking to Sony for my "casual" games
[02:19] <bufbaf> lol@jaroshs guile vid ^^
[02:19] <Narayan> But boxing games I can dig.
[02:19] * Killthee has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[02:19] <Flachmatuch> that's all about the game ideas anyway
[02:19] <ryaxnb> and thats enough, combined with the HD, to get me riled up.
[02:19] <Flachmatuch> which Nintendo is much better at
[02:19] <ryaxnb> i was thinking like king kong vs godzilla.
[02:19] <jman2050> there's no reason someone who liked the Wii shouldn't like Move
[02:19] <jman2050> and vice versa
[02:19] <ryaxnb> or some cool "casual" fight title like that.
[02:19] <darkh23> you know right about now I'd welcome SF4 chat back

[02:20] <jman2050> don't even joke like that
[02:20] <vulvaschool> they won't show it
[02:20] <Narayan> Otherwise Ubi is dead to me.
[02:20] <vulvaschool> video games died today anyways
[02:20] <ryaxnb> but again, the move controller is not great for platformers.
[02:20] <GaimeGuy> rip
[02:20] <ryaxnb> vulva, i think ms died.
[02:20] <vulvaschool> nah
[02:20] <jman2050> Ratchet is to SMG what Bubsy 3D is to Mario 64
[02:20] <vulvaschool> they took out all video games with them
[02:20] <Unison_> lol
[02:20] <ryaxnb> nintendo has shown hardcore games can use motion controls.
[02:20] <vulvaschool> suicide bombers
[02:21] <vulvaschool> video games are dead
[02:21] <vulvaschool> get a new hobby
[02:21] <Narayan> PC GAMING IS THE FUTURE.
[02:21] <ryaxnb> vulvaschool, quite well (see MP3, SMG2, etc)
[02:21] <vulvaschool> I know
[02:21] <vulvaschool> but
[02:21] <GaimeGuy> but wat
[02:21] <vulvaschool> this is more than just motion controls
[02:21] <Flachmatuch> hehe i like ratchets and jaks too
[02:21] <ryaxnb> what is it?
[02:21] <ryaxnb> 3d motion controls? :-P
[02:22] <Flachmatuch> i'm not a huge nintendo game fan tbh, i actually like Jak 2 better than nintendo platformers
[02:22] <vulvaschool> % of time we were watching kinect garbage, number of games announced?
[02:22] <ryaxnb> vulva, well kinect is garbag
[02:22] <Flachmatuch> which is stupid i know
[02:22] <Unison_> ubisoft is starting on G4?
[02:22] <HK-47> why?
[02:22] <vulvaschool> how many non-kinect mini games were announced
[02:22] <vulvaschool> at MS
[02:22] <darkh23> not till 8pm unison
[02:22] <threi-laptop> 0
[02:22] <Acosta> zero
[02:22] <darkh23> maybe a 30 min preshow?
[02:22] <ryaxnb> vulva, my personal opinin = kinect is more for casuals then mvoe.
[02:22] <Unison_> they just started it
[02:22] <Unison_> yeah
[02:22] <jman2050> Flach: you picked Jak 2 of all things?
[02:22] <darkh23> wtfz
[02:22] * darkh23 fires up the plasma
[02:22] <jman2050> come on, at least go with Jak and Daxter
[02:22] <Orin_Docks> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoJ9XDH-eO8&feature=related
[02:22] <Orin_Docks> lol
[02:22] <Flachmatuch> yep
[02:22] <ryaxnb> vulva, sony's commitment to move for hardcore and socom and all first party indicates theyre serious about hardcore FPS with move.
[02:22] <vulvaschool> how many games did they show that were just more of the same at the MS conference?
[02:23] <ryaxnb> vulva, again, MS is full of shit.
[02:23] <jman2050> which is Naughty Dog's best game and one of the view top-tier platformers from last gen
[02:23] <threi-laptop> btw where are the dance game gifs
[02:23] <vulvaschool> who cares about FPS?
[02:23] <ryaxnb> dont base things on MS.
[02:23] <Flachmatuch> i liked 2 a lot better
[02:23] <Flachmatuch> hehehe
[02:23] <Flachmatuch> and 3
[02:23] <Narayan> Man. I want to smoke tonight, but I just had to get a fucking root canal.
[02:23] <vulvaschool> especially console fps
[02:23] <ryaxnb> vulva, what about games like platformers and RTS?
[02:23] <ryaxnb> they would go well with motion.
[02:23] <vulvaschool> name 5 new platformers coming out
[02:23] * Killthee_ has joined #ga
[02:23] <vulvaschool> name 4
[02:23] <vulvaschool> 3
[02:23] <ryaxnb> E3 just started
[02:23] <Flachmatuch> i'm not saying i'm right hehe, i just like them better, can't help that
[02:23] <ryaxnb> i cant name any till the nintendo and sony conferences
[02:23] <jman2050> RTSes as they are now wouldn't work on consoles regardless of motion controls
[02:23] <ryaxnb> ask me then.
[02:23] <vulvaschool> kk
[02:23] <jman2050> you'd need to reinvent the wheel
[02:24] <Unison_> urrm
[02:24] <Unison_> there was that xbla one
[02:24] <Unison_> shown today
[02:24] <threi-laptop> so far the game i'm most hyped for is NFS
[02:24] * Killthee has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[02:24] * Killthee_ is now known as Killthee
[02:24] <ryaxnb> most of them just came out.
[02:24] <threi-laptop> thats....kinda sad
[02:24] <vulvaschool> the art-game thing?
[02:24] <vulvaschool> can't remember its name
[02:24] <stump> Limbo.
[02:24] <jman2050> NFS actually looks like it did back when it was good
[02:24] <Unison_> lol they are bragging about just dance on g4
[02:24] <vulvaschool> yeah
[02:24] <ryaxnb> we just had NSMBwii, mega man 9 & 10, boy and his blob, sonic 4, SMg2
[02:24] <jman2050> pre-Porsche Unleashed
[02:24] * MiGvuzela has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[02:24] * fjolle has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[02:24] <Acosta> those ign ads about used stuff are hilarious
[02:24] <ryaxnb> those were nice.
[02:24] <Unison_> NFS is criterion?
[02:24] <jett> is GT.com still dead?
[02:24] <threi-laptop> wait
[02:24] <jett> yep.
[02:24] <threi-laptop> are you implying
[02:25] <jman2050> which, incidentally, stands as one of the more disappointing sequels I've played
[02:25] <threi-laptop> that Porche Unleashed wasn't good?
[02:25] <HK-47> how is ubisoft in the red with so many big successes?
[02:25] <jett> what the hell happened to gametrailers
[02:25] * threi-laptop gets out a knife
[02:25] <jman2050> Porsche Unleashed was ass
[02:25] <HK-47> They must be run like shit
[02:25] <jman2050> High Stakes owns
[02:25] <jman2050> HP and HP2 less so, but still pretty neat
[02:25] <GaimeGuy> HK:  Pretty much all western pubs are operating like taht
[02:25] <GaimeGuy> EA
[02:25] <threi-laptop> porsche unleashed was the best one
[02:25] <GaimeGuy> Activision
[02:25] <GaimeGuy> ubi
[02:25] <GaimeGuy> take two
[02:25] <ryaxnb> EA i really want to succeed.
[02:25] <jman2050> it was all downhill after PU
[02:25] <darkh23> lol unison this chick
[02:25] <GaimeGuy> they all overextended themselves
[02:25] <Unison_> lol @ Avatar @ 600k combined
[02:25] <ryaxnb> one of the few places i could see natal working is not in games at all.
[02:25] <threi-laptop> *HP2
[02:25] <vulvaschool> so other than a boy and his blob, it's all just sequels and rehashes, ryaxnb?
[02:25] <HK-47> God, they need to fail if that type of success isnt enough
[02:25] <darkh23> wonder how many times she had to practice that line
[02:25] <GaimeGuy> expanded too much
[02:25] <ryaxnb> more like wii fit clones.
[02:25] <threi-laptop> well actually
[02:25] <jett> unison: where you got that info?
[02:25] <threi-laptop> I didn't mind Underground
[02:26] <Unison_> hahaha
[02:26] <ryaxnb> so ea sports active 2 could be natal cool.
[02:26] * fallout has joined #ga
[02:26] <GaimeGuy> you take on too many fixed expenses (payroll, particularly)
[02:26] <ryaxnb> for those who care (read: no on ehere)
[02:26] <HK-47> Thats just in NA, Unison
[02:26] <ryaxnb> vulva, but theyre all GOOD
[02:26] <Orin_Docks> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC5FgQU-gns&feature=related
[02:26] <threi-laptop> worst one in the series was carbon though
[02:26] <Unison_> i know
[02:26] <Expy> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=21850412&postcount=638
[02:26] <vulvaschool> sonic 4 is good?
[02:26] <ryaxnb> and a lot we havent had sequels for years.
[02:26] <Expy> HMMMMMMM
[02:26] <ryaxnb> i like this wave.
[02:26] <threi-laptop> and most wanted is overrated
[02:26] <ryaxnb> this gen is doing well, and i predict more good to come.
[02:27] <vulvaschool> I hated nsmbwii
[02:27] <vulvaschool> mega man 9 and 10 were cool
[02:27] <vulvaschool> but just rehashes
[02:27] <threi-laptop> oh god
[02:27] <jett> unison: where did you get that ubisoft information
[02:27] <Flachmatuch> this gen is starting to do ok now
[02:27] <threi-laptop> vulva is killing me
[02:27] <threi-laptop> D:
[02:27] <ryaxnb> even Natal wont obscure the stuff like Crytek game and stuff that ms has that could be decent.-
[02:27] <Unison_> Lock N Chase came out for PSP!?
[02:27] <GaimeGuy> lol @ EA having a -25% gross margin
[02:27] <GaimeGuy> in 2008
[02:27] <ryaxnb> and thats ms, who is almost certainly going to lose this e3.
[02:27] <vulvaschool> crytek will probably be more fps garbage
[02:28] <ryaxnb> i think for the first time, from the very first conference and leaks, its plain obvious who lost e3.
[02:28] <ryaxnb> MS.
[02:28] <jman2050> threi: I did think the one that was released recently
[02:28] <jman2050> um...
[02:28] <jman2050> I forget what it's called
[02:28] <jman2050> the dirt race one
[02:28] * Gatsu-Kun has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[02:28] <jman2050> where it basically cloned the fast and the furious
[02:28] <vulvaschool> sorry bro, but video games are dead
[02:28] <jman2050> I don't even remember it there's so many
[02:28] <threi-laptop> oh
[02:28] <threi-laptop> pro street
[02:28] <Flachmatuch> vulvaschool: buy a ds hehe
[02:28] <jman2050> yeah pro street
[02:28] <vulvaschool> I have one
[02:29] <jman2050> I thought that one had some merit
[02:29] <vulvaschool> and haven't used it in so long
[02:29] <HK-47> jett: Its was the NA numbers for Avatar, shown on G4
[02:29] <ryaxnb> even if all sony shows is killzone 3 and littlebig planet 2, theyre better than ms.
[02:29] <Flachmatuch> loads of great videogames on the ds
[02:29] <jman2050> but still bleh overall
[02:29] <vulvaschool> I basically just use my DS for neogeo games now
[02:29] <threi-laptop> the demo was enough for me
[02:29] <threi-laptop> well
[02:29] <vulvaschool> pochi & Nyaa~
[02:29] <threi-laptop> half of the demo
[02:29] <Expy> http://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4489/1276555539784.png
[02:29] <HK-47> Too many good games on DS
[02:29] <Unison_> lol @ this commercial
[02:29] <HK-47> I cant afford them all
[02:29] <vulvaschool> killzone 3 is in no way any better than showing halo reach
[02:29] <jman2050> 3DS GET HYPE
[02:29] <Unison_> DOES YOUR COMPUTER WORK?
[02:29] <jett> hk-47 i see
[02:29] <ryaxnb> and all nintendo has to do is show playable 3ds or zelda wii and they are better than ms.
[02:29] <jman2050> are people still hyping up Killzone to be some respected franchise?
[02:30] <Luckett> K2 was good
[02:30] * GaimeGuy gets hhype
[02:30] <jman2050> vanilla FPS #3425?
[02:30] <Luckett> fuck youuuuuuu~
[02:30] <Unison_> hey
[02:30] <Flachmatuch> hhahaha what the hell is that Expy
[02:30] <Unison_> how about Microsoft today
[02:30] <Unison_> hahahahha
[02:30] <ryaxnb> i like vanilla fps
[02:30] * Shinobi_LeMans has joined #ga
[02:30] <ryaxnb> i9 like timesplitter, perfect dark, quake, doom
[02:30] <jman2050> I like some FPSes
[02:30] <jman2050> like
[02:30] <ryaxnb> all fairly vanilla. but reallyfun
[02:30] <jman2050> I do like Halo
[02:30] <Expy> Some Japanese person drew that
[02:30] <Expy> lol
[02:30] <Luckett> Halo Reach looked balls
[02:30] <Expy> it's in the MS Conference thread
[02:30] <threi-laptop> i like left 4 dead
[02:30] <jman2050> and it's funny how I love that game but every FPS that's tried to copy it since then has been bleh
[02:30] <threi-laptop> fuck everything else
[02:30] <Flachmatuch> hehehe
[02:31] <jman2050> also Half-Life is the best FPS series
[02:31] <Luckett> Bungie's Activision project, I could not wish more ill will upon it
[02:31] <Flachmatuch> hehe i'm way too old for l4d
[02:31] <Flachmatuch> soooo fast
[02:31] <Flachmatuch> hahaha
[02:31] <threi-laptop> i liked UT until UT3
[02:31] <jman2050> and Portal actually does something with the FPS genre that isn't tired/cliche, and moronic
[02:31] <Narayan> Luckett: I hope you mean that it looked awesome, because I thought it looked pretty great.
[02:31] <threi-laptop> UT2k1 > Quake btw
[02:31] <vulvaschool> you can have a first person perspective and still make a fun game
[02:31] <vulvaschool> mirror's edge showed that
[02:31] <jman2050> Metroid Prime is kind of a unique FPS, but an FPS nonetheless, and I loved it
[02:31] <Luckett> wonder what this sickle icon on the Konami stuff is....
[02:31] <vulvaschool> but why work on something new, when we can pretend going to 'nam is something new
[02:31] <jman2050> also I thought Crysis was neat
[02:31] <threi-laptop> mirrors edge is fucking awesome agreed
[02:31] <Luckett> kojima project....
[02:32] * Brannon has joined #ga
[02:32] <jakehk> ubisoft on?
[02:32] <jman2050> but yeah, aside from those I listed everything else can suck it
[02:32] <jman2050> in that genre
[02:32] <Narayan> jakehk: 28 minutes.
[02:32] <Flachmatuch> hehe i don't count it as an fps because you don't really need to aim
[02:32] * Lakitu7 has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[02:32] <threi-laptop> its not really the FP i have a problem with, its the S
[02:32] <jman2050> which one, Metroid Prime?
[02:32] <jakehk> k
[02:32] <Flachmatuch> no headshots etc...so wiimote controls aren't as awesome as for re4 for example, imo
[02:32] <Narayan> FPA.
[02:32] <threi-laptop> pick up a gun and shoot things = you aren't trying hard enough
[02:32] <jman2050> it's definitely an FPS by definition, but it's a decidedly non-shooty take on the thing
[02:32] <GaimeGuy> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=21846360&postcount=15369   lol
[02:33] <Narayan> I think FPA is valid.
[02:33] <jman2050> it's not really a platformer either
[02:33] <jman2050> well okay it is
[02:33] <Narayan> I never said it was a platformer though.
[02:33] <Narayan> You do a lot of adventuring.
[02:33] <threi-laptop> well the same can be said for the 2d metroids
[02:33] <jman2050> but it isn't a platformer at its core like the 2D games are
[02:33] <vulvaschool> it's an fps
[02:33] <threi-laptop> they were hybrid genres as well
[02:33] <jman2050> I dunno, it's really hard to describe Metroid Prime
[02:33] <threi-laptop> its just the franchise
[02:33] <ryaxnb> what about call of duty reflex
[02:33] <ryaxnb> good game for wii
[02:33] <jman2050> The 2D Metroid games are very definitely platformers
[02:34] <jman2050> Super Metroid especially
[02:34] <ryaxnb> proof of concept for fps controls
[02:34] <Narayan> I consider a game an FPS if its linear. Metroid Prime isn't really like that.
[02:34] <Narayan> it's*
[02:34] <ryaxnb> they were action adventure IMHO.
[02:34] <jman2050> oh
[02:34] <ryaxnb> Narayan, neither is doom.
[02:34] <jman2050> OH
[02:34] <vulvaschool> narayan, do you shoot? is it first person?
[02:34] <jman2050> god I'm dumb
[02:34] <jman2050> I made a terrible oversight
[02:34] <ryaxnb> you go back and forth searching for keys.
[02:34] <jman2050> Deus Ex
[02:34] <jman2050> second best FPS ever
[02:34] <ryaxnb> and that is an fps if nothing else is.
[02:34] <threi-laptop> yeah deus ex 2 was awesome
[02:34] <Flachmatuch> hehe i don't care what it's called, fps or fpa, i just can't play it as an fps
[02:34] * Vic has joined #ga
[02:34] <BJ> Michael Cuddyer in center field????
[02:34] <jman2050> so much so that I subconsciously refuse to classify it under that genre!
[02:34] * threi-laptop runs
[02:35] <ryaxnb> i mean, if by your logic, doom is not an fps, your logic fails.
[02:35] <Narayan> vulvaschool: Those two mechanics shouldn't make it an FPS.
[02:35] <vulvaschool> why not?
[02:35] <FirewalkR> all of a sudden i've come to a realization. this E3 is boring the hell out of me.
[02:35] <FirewalkR> i hope tomorrow's better
[02:35] <ryaxnb> Narayan, linear doesnt work either
[02:35] <ryaxnb> doom isnt linear.
[02:35] <jman2050> Deus Ex did the railroaded open world correctly the first time
[02:35] <Narayan> I guess.
[02:35] <vulvaschool> I don't play sonic and mario the same way, but they're both platformers
[02:35] <jman2050> and it's terrible that games didn't outright ape it from then on
[02:35] <vulvaschool> good level design doesn't stop it from being an fps
[02:36] <ryaxnb> vulva, agreed
[02:36] <ryaxnb> sonic and mario are awesome
[02:36] <ryaxnb> yay for mario and sonic.
[02:36] <vulvaschool> too bad sonic died years back
[02:36] <Narayan> That makes sense. I just didn't get an FPS vibe from it at all.
[02:36] <ryaxnb> an olympic games pack could be good for kinecgt
[02:36] <ryaxnb> another big problem with kinect is the launch games.
[02:36] <kassatsu> Wes: http://i46.tinypic.com/33be4jd.jpg <- was that today?
[02:37] <ryaxnb> no golf game? no olympic pack? no snowboarding? no rts? no strategy game? no hack-n-slash?
[02:37] <threi-laptop> smb3 > sonic 3 > smw > sonic 2 > smb2 > sonic 1 > smb
[02:37] <ryaxnb> all could potentially work with kinect.
[02:37] * thatbox has joined #ga
[02:37] <vulvaschool> the big problem is that kinect is killing video games in MS conceding defeat in video games, and taking everyone out with them
[02:37] <jman2050> Sonic 3K > Sonic 2 > Sonic 1 > SMB3 > SMW > the rest
[02:37] <Narayan> Klonoa 2 is my favorite platformer.
[02:37] <jman2050> YI is somewhere else
[02:37] <threi-laptop> sonic 1 over smb3
[02:38] <threi-laptop> hell no
[02:38] <jett> no sonic game has ever been better than mario
[02:38] <HK-47> jman is teh crazy
[02:38] <jett> sonic games are kinda trash actually
[02:38] <vulvaschool> nah
[02:38] <jman2050> Sonic was always better than Mario
[02:38] <jman2050> sorry dudes!
[02:38] <vulvaschool> jman's right
[02:38] <jett> in all dimensions
[02:38] <vulvaschool> jman's got it right
[02:38] <HK-47> what about the first dimension?
[02:38] <vulvaschool> sonic
[02:38] <RagnarokX> Sonic 3 is the best oldschool platformer
[02:38] <GaimeGuy> o_o
[02:38] <Luckett> lets not discuss sonic
[02:38] * Jonah has joined #ga
[02:38] <jman2050> oh I'll discuss Sonic
[02:38] <GaimeGuy> too late
[02:38] <Old_Lace> no, sonic 3 & knuckles is the best
[02:39] <GaimeGuy> you are in the sonnic cycle
[02:39] <jman2050> all day if I need to
[02:39] <vulvaschool> but this point is moot since video games no longer matter. we should all take up knitting now instead
[02:39] <vulvaschool> that won't die
[02:39] <Luckett> lets let him die with whatever horrible disease that is, and we'll just move on with out lives
[02:39] <BJ> *reads sonic and the knuckles
[02:39] <TheNatural> sonic isnt better than mario, ever
[02:39] <GaimeGuy> vulva: yes it will
[02:39] <HK-47> I like Ristar better than Sonic
[02:39] <ryaxnb> and they stooped so low as to make 2 racing games the highlight of Kinect and saying kinect will revolutionize raacing games... Hello? Excite Truck? Control was OK, but not great by any means.
[02:39] <Narayan> Jace Hall is funny as Hell.
[02:39] <RagnarokX> I don't consider S&K and Sonic 3 to be seperate games, just bad marketting
[02:39] <vulvaschool> knitting is eternal
[02:39] <jman2050> crocheting killed knitting
[02:39] <GaimeGuy> everyone willl start walking around nekkid
[02:39] <jman2050> where is your god now vulva
[02:39] <Flachmatuch> there's no point in arguing about names...but if i was looking for the same gameplay in MP as what I get in Halo, I'd be disappointed
[02:39] <threi-laptop> here i come
[02:39] <threi-laptop> rougher than the rest of them
[02:39] <threi-laptop> the best of them
[02:39] <vulvaschool> nah jman crocheting EVOLVED it
[02:39] <ryaxnb> i mean, kinect is just not for racing games.
[02:39] <threi-laptop> tougher than leather

[02:39] <Luckett> "That said, I've seen demos of natal - early demos (on the Jimmy Kimmel show) and it wasn't laggy at all. PS3 motion - the demo I watched of that had a huge delay. No thanks. "
[02:39] * GaimeGuy bounces
[02:40] <threi-laptop> they call me knuckles
[02:40] <Luckett> i hate discussing games with "outsiders"
[02:40] <Luckett> i just get.... angry

[02:40] <GaimeGuy> raaage
[02:40] <HK-47> lol outsiders?
[02:40] <threi-laptop> i just flex my muscles
[02:40] <RagnarokX> HK-47, Ristar would have been better if it was a little faster and the sound wasn't terrible
[02:40] <ryaxnb> holding an imaginary steering wheel << holding a wii wheel <<< holding a REAL steering wheel
[02:40] <TheNatural> gee i hope ubi shows some shooter games in about 20 minutes, we havent seen that many yet
[02:40] <stump> Luckett: url?
[02:40] * PopOnArrival has joined #ga
[02:40] <Luckett> people that know nothing about games and say things like "that nintendo xbox"
[02:40] <Luckett> not on gaf
[02:40] <HK-47> I like it so much, Rag =(
[02:40] <jman2050> <RagnarokX> HK-47, Ristar would have been better if it was a little faster and the sound wasn't terrible
[02:40] <HK-47> I never got a second one
[02:40] <jman2050> if it was a little faster and the sound wasn't terrible
[02:40] <threi-laptop> <3 knuckles rap

[02:40] <ryaxnb> dk rap!
[02:40] <jman2050> sound wasn't terrible
[02:40] <jman2050> ...
[02:40] <jman2050> ......
[02:40] <jman2050> ............................
[02:40] <RagnarokX> sound, not music
[02:40] <GaimeGuy> only 3DS can save E3
[02:41] <GaimeGuy> and ogre battle wii
[02:41] <Luckett> sorry i just started laughing imagining a Retro Studios Donkey Kong tomorrow
[02:41] <Mandoric> +yes gaime
[02:41] <ryaxnb> GaimeGuy, zelda wii for the save.
[02:41] <Luckett> and I cant seem to stop
[02:41] <Mandoric> enjoy your 3ds trailers
[02:41] <ryaxnb> also, pikmin 3.
[02:41] <Mandoric> on your 2d monitor
[02:41] <jman2050> First Person Donkey Kong
[02:41] <Unison_> i should be boycotting ubi conference after that natal shit today
[02:41] <ryaxnb> how about them Killzone 3?
[02:41] <Unison_> haha
[02:41] <jman2050> shoot barrels and king krool
[02:41] <TheNatural> goldeneye, donkey knog, and zelda, i like it
[02:41] <jman2050> at
[02:41] <GaimeGuy> fuck goldeneye
[02:41] <Mandoric> 3ds will probably be pretty cool but it's going to be a media bomb
[02:41] <RagnarokX> Snatcher for Wii
[02:41] <TheNatural> dont be a hater
[02:41] <ryaxnb> media bomb?
[02:41] <RagnarokX> :P
[02:41] <Mandoric> because until you see it in person it's a clamshell psp
[02:41] <ryaxnb> you serious?
[02:41] <ryaxnb> it has better graphics than ps3.
[02:41] <ryaxnb> and er, psp
[02:41] <HK-47> I think I want Pikmin 3 to be revealed the most.
[02:41] <threi-laptop> donkey kong will have a permanent banana cannon on his right arm
[02:42] <jman2050> we don't even really know what the 3DS is
[02:42] <ryaxnb> and c'mon, people can trust in 3d.
[02:42] <jman2050> except that it has a 3D screen
[02:42] <ryaxnb> media arent that stupid
[02:42] <Luckett> cant wait to wave goodbye to DS 3d
[02:42] <vulvaschool> doesn't matter jman, 3DS is cancelled
[02:42] <vulvaschool> gaming's over
[02:42] <Luckett> my god
[02:42] <GaimeGuy> jman:   Well, from the sounds of it,it's pretty powerful
[02:42] <Mandoric> we know the 3ds is a) not going to be retarded expensive
[02:42] <jman2050> it's like the DS all over again
[02:42] <Mandoric> b) will be profitable
[02:42] <RagnarokX> jman2050, we have a pokedex
[02:42] <Rorschach> http://i49.tinypic.com/24yn4aa.jpg hahaha
[02:42] <Mandoric> and c) willo have a decent batter life
[02:42] <HK-47> its what was inside the ark of the covenant, jman
[02:42] <Narayan> I'll only start caring about 3D for consoles when autostereoscopic displays hit the market.
[02:42] <Luckett> Phantasy Star Zero nearly made me blind
[02:42] <jman2050> the DS used to just be a game boy with two screens
[02:42] <Narayan> Fuck that glasses shit.
[02:42] <ryaxnb> everyone knows the 3ds will rock
[02:42] <Mandoric> profitable under $200 ten hours = psp spec at double the framerate
[02:42] <jman2050> it wasn't until later that the touch screen business was revealed
[02:42] <ryaxnb> media is  just waiting for nintendos word.
[02:42] <Narayan> 3DS is what I'm excited for the most.
[02:43] <Shinobi_LeMans> actually it'll be shit
[02:43] <Luckett> cant wait to see how hideous LAUNCH ITERATION ONLY FOOLS PURCHASE is going to be
[02:43] <Shinobi_LeMans> but it'll blow up
[02:43] <Flachmatuch> (1:40:36 AM) Luckett: people that know nothing about games and say things like "that nintendo xbox"
[02:43] <Flachmatuch> hahahahaa
[02:43] <Mandoric> which will be pretty damn awesome with the added resolution!
[02:43] <GaimeGuy> Mandoric:   it sounds like 3ds is mucch, much more powerful than PSP
[02:43] <Narayan> They're still showing it, right?
[02:43] <Shinobi_LeMans> that's a guarantee
[02:43] <jman2050> Shinobi stop hatin
[02:43] <jman2050> you hate everything
[02:43] <Shinobi_LeMans> or what?
[02:43] <GaimeGuy> like,  closer to 360 than Wii
[02:43] <Unison_> will g4 have commercials during ubi conference?
[02:43] <ryaxnb> i mean, they cant be so stupid as to predict fail for the 3ds after  every single nintendo handheld won bigtime can they?
[02:43] <Shinobi_LeMans> dude, there ain't nothing but hate on the net
[02:43] <Shinobi_LeMans> join in or step aside
[02:43] <ryaxnb> they tried that with DS and that didnt work.
[02:43] <Mandoric> well
[02:43] <Mandoric> it
[02:43] <Narayan> Just ask Wasabi.
[02:43] <ryaxnb> they must have learned their lesson.
[02:43] <jman2050> media?
[02:43] <Mandoric> 's3x the resolution of the wii
[02:43] <HK-47> 3DS is the Phantom
[02:43] <jman2050> learning their lesson?
[02:43] <jman2050> surely you jest
[02:43] <Mandoric> maybe that helps!
[02:44] <Narayan> So -- wait, they AREN'T showing 3DS at the conference?
[02:44] <Shinobi_LeMans> now who's hatin'?
[02:44] <threi-laptop> 3ds is nintendo's PS3
[02:44] <Luckett> todays lesson: we're rich!!
[02:44] <Mandoric> that's more a knock on the wii than anything though
[02:44] <ryaxnb> Narayan, yes they are.
[02:44] * GaimeGuy slaps Narayan around a bit with a large trout
[02:44] <ghst> just got back, so is the 360 dead to you all yet?
[02:44] <Luckett> <threi-laptop> 3ds is nintendo's PS3
[02:44] <ryaxnb> ghst,  well kinect
[02:44] <ryaxnb>  is
[02:44] <Narayan> Okay. I was about to be filled with disappoint.
[02:44] <Luckett> that needs to be immortalised
[02:44] <HK-47> its a zombie to me, ghst
[02:44] <Mandoric> 3ds will be pretty but it will not be fucknuts
[02:44] <ryaxnb> ghst, my dreams of hardcore kinect games are done.
[02:44] <Mandoric> if it is fucknuts it will actually be horible
[02:44] <Shinobi_LeMans> yeah, I'm gonna trade my 360 in for the awesomey ps3
[02:44] <Flachmatuch> (1:43:32 AM) ryaxnb: i mean, they cant be so stupid as to predict fail for the 3ds after  every single nintendo handheld won bigtime can they?
[02:44] <GaimeGuy> dreams -> shattered?
[02:44] <ghst> my dreams of hardcore console games are done.
[02:44] <Wario64> apparently ubisoft's conference location has no AC, lol
[02:44] <ryaxnb> ghst, eh?
[02:44] <Luckett> does 3DS mean death of Nintendo Wii games now, other than Zelda?
[02:45] <Luckett> thats how they seem to operate
[02:45] <Flachmatuch> the "media" is completely not independent though
[02:45] <Flachmatuch> it's just PR
[02:45] <Tony_Parker> oi BJ look what I got in the mail today fella http://imgur.com/SmmXv.jpg
[02:45] <ryaxnb> ghst, BS.
[02:45] <Luckett> since they havent exactly expanded to manage 2 platforms at once, ever
[02:45] <Flachmatuch> and I guess MS and Sony are relying on them a lot more than Nintendo
[02:45] <RagnarokX> I'm surprised people are still defending Kinect after last night and today
[02:45] <ryaxnb> hardcore games are popular as ever.
[02:45] <Mandoric> get something nice, competent, psp/wii at 960x480x2, decent price
[02:45] <jman2050> http://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4489/1276555539784.png
[02:45] <ghst> i'm not interested in the same butt franchises ms have been spinning since the beginning of the generation.
[02:45] <jman2050> what the hell
[02:45] <Luckett> even more now that the 3DS will be closer to gamecube
[02:45] <jman2050> Japan you so silly
[02:45] <Mandoric> idiots will predict bomba on flat 2d coverage
[02:45] <ghst> and that's all ms is interested in
[02:45] * Vic_ has joined #ga
[02:45] <Mandoric> reality will be pretty cool
[02:45] <ryaxnb> nintendo has metroid, sony has killzone and socom and such, and ms has halo and CoD.
[02:45] <ghst> that and child grooming simulators.
[02:45] <pj> can i preorder dance central now
[02:45] <ghst> casual trash.
[02:46] <Shinobi_LeMans> this generation is shit
[02:46] <BJ> jobber: hehe
[02:46] <ryaxnb> Mandoric, no.
[02:46] <TheNatural> But something very large is being uploaded on the main content server that Valve uses to distribute files to other content servers
[02:46] * gloone has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.5.9/20100315083431])
[02:46] <Shinobi_LeMans> maybe by the time this e3 wraps up most people would have opend their eyes to that reality
[02:46] <TheNatural> Valve about to explode
[02:46] <HK-47> Nintendo has the Kid Icarus shooter lololol
[02:46] <ryaxnb> after seeing nintendo win EVERY SINGLE handheld gen since game & Watch. the media will believe in 3ds
[02:46] <Mandoric> pit's bow training
[02:46] <Flachmatuch> stupid MS has fucked up their best stuff
[02:46] <vulvaschool> any word when, during e3, valve will do... something?
[02:46] <Luckett> e3 seems a bit weird without cassamamsmsmsaina
[02:46] <ryaxnb> i hope.
[02:46] <Flachmatuch> MSTS and MSFS hehe
[02:46] <Flachmatuch> wtf
[02:46] <Mandoric> ryanb: the media will believe (because ms doesn't have a handheld)
[02:46] <ghst> is ryan new? he seems weird.
[02:46] <Flachmatuch> original Kuju trainsim is still the best
[02:46] <Mandoric> i meant random gaffots
[02:46] <GaimeGuy> ryan is futami
[02:47] <ryaxnb> ghst, im a nintendo fan
[02:47] * Vic has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[02:47] <vulvaschool> weird
[02:47] <ryaxnb> thus im weird to some.
[02:47] <HK-47> Valve will announce it during the Nintendo conf, just to fuck with things
[02:47] <ghst> weird to people who are protective over their kids.
[02:47] <darkh23> ghst more than half the room is new
[02:47] <darkh23> there's usually like 45 people in here
[02:47] <GaimeGuy> 42 of whom are me
[02:47] <HK-47> what a tweest
[02:47] <pj> its more like 70-80
[02:47] <pj> avg
[02:47] <Luckett> e3 is gaming christmas
[02:48] <HK-47> not this year lol
[02:48] <ryaxnb> most in here, i would wager, dont like motion controls, think nintendo sucks, and think motion is draining gaming
[02:48] <Luckett> except this christmas someone has been sick everywhere
[02:48] <pj> santa brought charcoal this year
[02:48] <Narayan> Except me. I'm a sentient offshoot of GaimeGuy.
[02:48] <pj> and shoved it up my asshole
[02:48] <threi-laptop> e3 gaf, world cup gaf, and sf4 gaf
[02:48] <bufbaf> i like nintendo
[02:48] <Unison_> lol
[02:48] <RagnarokX> the youbibore conference is almost upon us
[02:48] <HK-47> Im a robot

[02:48] <Unison_> in ten minutes
[02:48] <ghst> what's the general consensus, i'm lttp.
[02:48] <RagnarokX> you may fall asleep
[02:48] <Narayan> I hope Pele saves the day again.
[02:48] <GaimeGuy> rag:  call me when they make rayman 4
[02:48] <RagnarokX> James Cameron should give another synopsis of Avatar
[02:49] <ryaxnb> im also very very  optimistic :)
[02:49] <GaimeGuy> lol
[02:49] <Shinobi_LeMans> yeah
[02:49] <Narayan> Avatar 2.
[02:49] <RagnarokX> "Last year I released Avatar. Let's recap the plot..."
[02:49] <Shinobi_LeMans> then everyone can come on here and say how cameron's an idiot and avatar will be a megabomb
[02:49] <Narayan> Is Battle Angel still in the pipeline for him?
[02:49] <ryaxnb> RagnarokX, LOL
[02:49] <GaimeGuy> rag:  apparently he was supposed to show footage, but the studios pulled it at the last minute
[02:49] <bufbaf> he should make a synopsis of the bible
[02:49] <kassatsu> 10min til ubi
[02:49] <GaimeGuy> hence why he rambled
[02:49] <Unison_> he has a script for it Narayan
[02:49] <Tony_Parker> Rebamania http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R0c5pvQExY
[02:49] <Shinobi_LeMans> that was my e3 highlight last year, seeing multitudes make themselves look like fucking fools
[02:49] <Narayan> Nice. I look forward to seeing what he can do with it.
[02:49] <Unison_> is that comic good?
[02:49] <HK-47> a synopsis of War and Peace by James Cameron
[02:49] <Shinobi_LeMans> doubting cameron, lulz
[02:49] <Unison_> i have it on my ipad
[02:49] <Narayan> It's pretty good, yeah.
[02:49] <Unison_> didnt read it yet
[02:50] <Narayan> Entertaining. Not mindblowing or anything.
[02:50] <threi-laptop> http://www.gamereactor.se/media/19/legendzeldawii_201924.jpg
[02:50] <GaimeGuy> I will never doubt James Cummeron again
[02:50] <ryaxnb> i'm tired of steve Ballmer.
[02:50] <threi-laptop> ZERUDA
[02:50] <Narayan> It's no Monster, I can say that much.
[02:50] <ryaxnb> Ballmer for the fail.
[02:50] <Unison_> what's a mindblowing comic that i should read?
[02:50] <GaimeGuy> lol threi
[02:50] <Narayan> Monster - but that's a manga.
[02:50] <Yann> y the last man
[02:50] <pj> marmaduke
[02:50] <RagnarokX> One Piece?
[02:50] <HK-47> whats is no Monster?
[02:50] <GaimeGuy> that's the spaceworld  trailer for GC unveiling
[02:50] <Narayan> 100 Bullets.
[02:50] <Unison_> one piece lol
[02:50] <bufbaf> nextwave
[02:50] <Narayan> 100 Bullets is fucking AMAZING.
[02:50] <Yann> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_the_last_man
[02:50] <HK-47> I just finished reading Nextwave
[02:50] <Narayan> Like, HOLY FUCKING SHIT ON A STICK AMAZING.
[02:50] <Unison_> is this all manga?
[02:50] <Narayan> Read 100 Bullets, Uni.
[02:50] <jett> gaimeguy: it's not, but it is an old fake
[02:50] <RagnarokX> Because the last man
[02:50] <pj> its not that good
[02:50] <Unison_> i'd rather read USA comix
[02:51] <Unison_> :USA USA USA:
[02:51] <Narayan> No. 100 Bullets is a Vertigo comic.
[02:51] <bufbaf> like it hk? :)
[02:51] <Unison_> ok
[02:51] <HK-47> I also finished Global Frequency...fun as hell comic
[02:51] <HK-47> Yeah it was hilarious
[02:51] <Narayan> If you haven't read it yet, read Neil Gaiman's Sandman. That's my favorite comic -- EVER.
[02:51] <HK-47> Sandman is required reading
[02:51] <ghst> did ea announce anything atall?
[02:51] <ghst> worth remembering
[02:51] <Unison_> i read sandman
[02:51] <HadesGigas> showed Critereon NFS Hot Pursuit
[02:51] <Unison_> during the original run
[02:51] <Narayan> Have you read Death?
[02:52] <ghst> that it?
[02:52] <ghst> no battlefield 3 or anything
[02:52] <HadesGigas> as far as new stuff, i think
[02:52] <Unison_> yeah
[02:52] <Narayan> Blankets is pretty good, too.
[02:52] <darkh23> they showed crysis 2 running on xbawx....lolz
[02:52] <HK-47> I read both Death comics
[02:52] <Unison_> yeah i have blankets on my ipad
[02:52] <Narayan> There are more than two comics.
[02:52] <HK-47> I <3 Death.  Gaiman nailed that character
[02:52] <ghst> when is ubi?
[02:52] <Narayan> Get Absolute Death.
[02:52] <darkh23> 8min
[02:52] <Unison_> i read a comic called Black Hole this weekend
[02:52] <Narayan> Watchmen and V For Vendetta of course, but I'm sure you've read those.
[02:53] <Unison_> it was OK
[02:53] <Unison_> not great
[02:53] <osaka> ubisoft onference will be like
[02:53] <Unison_> but took like 2 hrs to read
[02:53] <Narayan> Pride of Baghdad?
[02:53] <Unison_> so worthwhile
[02:53] <HK-47> I liked Black Hole
[02:53] * Jide has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[02:53] <osaka> "SORRY, ubisoft conference was already installed in E3 2009, no can do"
[02:53] <Unison_> yeah, i liked it well enough
[02:53] <ghst> how did the room react to ms buying the affections of every walrus journalist in the room with a free 360?
[02:53] <HK-47> Top Ten is my favorite Moore comic
[02:53] <osaka> (i did a drm joke)
[02:53] <Narayan> Read 100 Bullets. It's great.
[02:53] <osaka> ghst: screams
[02:53] <Unison_> ok
[02:53] <Narayan> I liked it better than Y The Last Man.
[02:53] <Unison_> ipad is amazing for comics
[02:54] <Narayan> Maybe I should get one....
[02:54] <Flachmatuch> oh
[02:54] <HK-47> ghst: Everyone started quoting the famous oprah car giveaway
[02:54] <Narayan> Nah. I like printed format.
[02:54] <Flachmatuch> how hot does it get?
[02:54] <HK-47> I've been meaning to read 100 Bullets
[02:54] <Narayan> Hot enough to cook pancakes!
[02:54] <Narayan> iPad doubles as a griddle.
[02:54] <Unison_> i like not having to wait from month to month
[02:54] <Flachmatuch> when i tried  it it also seemed a bit too heavy?  but noone else said that so i must be mistaken
[02:54] <Shinobi_LeMans> don't those "journalists" have 360's already?
[02:54] <Unison_> just download the whole series
[02:54] <Unison_> lol
[02:54] <HK-47> Right now I'm reading a bunch of Ellis comic my firend gave me
[02:54] <Flachmatuch> nahh i love ebooks
[02:55] <Unison_> it's a tiny bity heavy
[02:55] <Unison_> i dont mind it but yeah
[02:55] <Unison_> the battery is what it is
[02:55] <Flachmatuch> but heat is a bigger question
[02:55] <Unison_> mine's in a case, so i dunno
[02:55] <Unison_> maybe dark does
[02:55] <Narayan> Arkham Asylum - A Serious House on Serious Earth?
[02:55] <Flachmatuch> hehe ok
[02:55] <darkh23> ipad gets luke warm at best
[02:55] <Narayan> Great Batman comic. One of my faves.
[02:55] <darkh23> most of the time it stays cool
[02:55] <Narayan> Year One. Of course.
[02:56] <Flachmatuch> hehe ok, cool
[02:56] <Unison_> Uncle Scrooge is bad-ass
[02:56] <Unison_> haha
[02:56] <Flachmatuch> only getting here at august or something
[02:56] <Narayan> Absolute Dark Knight, Hush, and The Long Halloween.
[02:56] <HK-47> Are there any Eliis comics you recommend.  I've read Planetary, Transmet, Nextwave, Black Gas and Global Frequency
[02:56] <Flachmatuch> hehehe
[02:56] <threi-laptop> kinect $149.99
[02:56] <threi-laptop> *price is right loser horn*
[02:56] <Shinobi_LeMans> what I figured it'd cost
[02:56] <Narayan> New Frontier is awesome. Kingdom Come and Justice, too.
[02:56] <Sanjuro> Can't believe soccer got moved.
[02:56] <Sanjuro> weird.
[02:56] <Sanjuro> I like Kingdom Come.
[02:56] <HK-47> Ah Long Halloween, before Loeb lost it completely
[02:56] <Shinobi_LeMans> which means they could've just called it Bombect
[02:56] <Narayan> Kingdom Come was epic.
[02:57] <Flachmatuch> hehe at least England got a goal from USA, that made my day hehehehe
[02:57] <Sanjuro> I like the Loeb and Sale stories
[02:57] <Narayan> Justice, I feel, is a precursor to Kingdom Come in ways.
[02:57] <Sanjuro> they are pointless
[02:57] <HK-47> though I feel bad for him.  He has never been the same since he lost his son
[02:57] <Sanjuro> but nice
[02:57] * thesoapster has joined #ga
[02:57] <Sanjuro> Superman and Daredevil stories I liked alot
[02:57] <Narayan> Whatever Happened to The Caped Crusader is good - but a VERY quick read.
[02:57] <Narayan> Slight reference to Death in it.
[02:57] <HK-47> Secret Identity is the best Supes comic
[02:57] <Unison_> i'm not crazy into superhero comics
[02:57] <Unison_> i am not adverse to them if they are great
[02:57] <Unison_> but they hold no great appeal
[02:58] <darkh23> yeah same
[02:58] <Orin_Docks> DC's bck story is so fucking confusing
[02:58] <darkh23> haha
[02:58] <Narayan> Sandman - Endless Nights -- Dream Hunters.
[02:58] <Sanjuro> Orin, they all are really
[02:58] <EviLore> <HK-47> Are there any Eliis comics you recommend.  I've read Planetary, Transmet, Nextwave, Black Gas and Global Frequency    <-----Desolation Jones, Fell, Orbiter, his run on The Authority, Ignition City, Freakangels
[02:58] <Orin_Docks> i cant get into the DC universe as a whole

[03:02] <EviLore> haha
[03:02] <Unison_> Ovary Fighter
[03:03] <Narayan> Early stages. The final game will RAPE.
[03:03] <kassatsu> this should have been at microsoft
[03:03] <kassatsu> better than all the shit they showed
[03:03] <Unison_> clearly kassatsu
[03:03] <Unison_> but still dumb
[03:03] <EviLore> looks like you just need to line up the enormous reticle with the enormous stuff on screen.  
[03:03] <Somnia> still wont make me buy Kinect
[03:03] <HK-47> Move > Kinect
[03:03] <Unison_> yeah EviLore
[03:03] <Unison_> haha
[03:03] <kassatsu> somnia you can play with move too
[03:03] <kassatsu> XD
[03:03] <Narayan> I can't believe this game is actually making it into fruition. That's so fucking awesome. REZ 2!

[03:04] <Unison_> haha
[03:04] <Shinobi_LeMans> didn't I see this on the jaguar cd?
[03:04] <Gattsu25> I played rez for over 100 hrs
[03:04] <ghst> lore, that's not the art. the art is being able to do it with half a second's sight into the future to make up for the input lag.
[03:04] <Gattsu25> I fucking loved that game
[03:04] <PezRadar> lame.. i get my car washed
[03:04] <PezRadar> and 3 mins later
[03:04] <Gattsu25> this is seriously amazing looking
[03:04] <darkh23> I don't even understand wtf he is doing
[03:04] <Narayan> I still need to get 100% on support items for Area 5.
[03:04] <PezRadar> someone decides to use windshield wipers
[03:04] <Unison_> lol dark
[03:04] <PezRadar> at 60mph
[03:04] <PezRadar> in front of me
[03:04] <ryaxnb> what are we talking about
[03:04] <PezRadar> so fucking annoying
[03:04] <Unison_> it auto fires
[03:04] <ghst> like sniping on 56k
[03:04] <Lo-Volt> That looks so tiring.
[03:04] <Gattsu25> not liking those vocals  =\
[03:04] <Unison_> and open/close hand
[03:04] <Narayan> It auto fires on KINECT.
[03:04] <Narayan> Move probably will be more functional.
[03:04] <Unison_> for lock on
[03:04] <kassatsu> yea
[03:04] <mrsolo> auto fires
[03:04] <HadesGigas> maybe tehres a mode where you say "pew pew pew" to make it fire
[03:05] <HK-47> Kinect gets dumb version?
[03:05] <Narayan> Probably.
[03:05] <Shinobi_LeMans> move will be easier to lose
[03:05] <Shinobi_LeMans> kinect > move
[03:05] <Unison_> really ubi? this is the best you can do?
[03:05] <azentium> looks like it
[03:05] <Unison_> hahhaha
[03:05] <Wes_> fires with velocity?
[03:05] <Narayan> Only a dumbass will buy Kinect.

[03:05] <TToB> Wow, this E3 so far is just cementing this as the worst generation EVARRRRR! Mid-generation crisises for MS and Sony, releasing stupidly overpriced version of Eyetoy and Waggle Wands. :\

[03:55] <Gattsu25> This doesn't look that bad
[03:55] <DrForester> Nintendo was Created By Gamers

[04:03] <Gattsu25> okay
[04:03] <BJ-Raw> one of these weeks
[04:03] <Narayan> Reminds me of the older GR games.
[04:03] <Gattsu25> this looks good
[04:03] <Brannon> Probably a developer controller?
[04:03] <Vic_> Crysis? Is that you?
[04:03] <Gattsu25> E3 redeemed
[04:03] <pj> why are they using cover
[04:03] <Luckett> is that steve blum
[04:03] <pj> they are invisible

[04:04] <ryaxnb> yes.
[04:04] <Brannon> His family sucked.
[04:04] <ryaxnb> but the invisibility effect hurts my eyes
[04:04] <Brannon> I know.
[04:04] <azentium> there's first person view?
[04:04] <Brannon> I was there.
[04:04] <Wario64> "can i please take this demo with me"
[04:04] <Sanjuro> This isn't a safe situation
[04:04] <Sanjuro> Vintage
[04:04] <Narayan> This looks pretty great.

[04:04] <azentium> nice*
[04:04] <EGM92> lol
[04:04] <impiri> hahahahahaha
[04:04] <BJ-Raw> :(
[04:04] <Jonah> lol
[04:04] <Brannon> Alwasy the same setup for stealth games. Two people get shot quietly, then the third one gets shanked or melee'd somehow.
[04:04] <ryaxnb> this is cool...
[04:04] <Sanjuro> Jobber: What happened with Bryan?
[04:04] <TheNatural> lol run off cole and king
[04:04] * Lo-Volt is now known as Dork64869
[04:05] <Bob_Coffee> i liked this better when it was called mgs4.
[04:05] <Tony_Parker> they fired him
[04:05] <Sanjuro> lol
[04:05] <ryaxnb> but ubisoft will forever remember as having the WORST conference ever.
[04:05] <pj> mgs4 wishes it was this BALLER
[04:05] <Sanjuro> right when he got his push?
[04:05] <ryaxnb> i am already blockking it from my mind.

[04:05] * Gatsu-Kun has joined #ga
[04:05] <minty> hawt ;0~~
[04:05] <Narayan> Why aren't they using knives or anything?
[04:05] <TheNatural> for choking the ring guy, supposedly too benoit like so he was fired
[04:05] <Somnia> ok this looks nice
[04:05] <ryaxnb> this is cool game.
[04:05] <PezRadar> this is awesome
[04:05] <impiri> these enemies have horrible vision
[04:05] <jett> this looks awesome
[04:05] <pj> new stealth kills dlc pack
[04:05] <pj> endeless
[04:05] <jett> more awesome than anything in mgs4
[04:05] <pj> the graphics are very good
[04:05] <ryaxnb> i still dont like the invisibility effect.
[04:05] <TheNatural> that guy looks like snitsky
[04:05] <Sanjuro> So this invasion angle is borked then. They are unstoppable...except when the WWE fires them
[04:05] <Shinobi_LeMans> like that's hard jett
[04:05] <Somnia> splinter cell engine
[04:05] <Somnia> btw
[04:06] <ryaxnb> my connection cut  out.
[04:06] <Shinobi_LeMans> haha sanj
[04:06] <Narayan> Oh. So 30fps capped on PC.
[04:06] <Luckett> the stealth shit surely makes this ridiculous
[04:06] <Brannon> I would like a mode where they do all this infiltration sans stealth suit.
[04:06] <DrForester> Somina, Make sure to use glvoes if someoen trades in Ubisoft vitality sensor
[04:06] <Narayan> The interface is wicked.
[04:06] <ryaxnb> ubisoft is done for me on pc
[04:06] <Brannon> Or a way to force your guys to not use the stealth suit
[04:06] <ryaxnb> they have draconian copy protection.
[04:06] <Sanjuro> At least we got Black Treasure Troll Cena
[04:06] <kass_laptop> that was cool
[04:06] <PezRadar> that
[04:06] <PezRadar> was
[04:06] <PezRadar> cool
[04:06] <ryaxnb> internet access required.
[04:06] <Narayan> Damn. That looksed SICK.
[04:06] <Tony_Parker> they're not even mentioning DB
[04:06] <jakehk> sp mite own in this

[04:28] <STG> My bets are on the cribs
[04:28] <Brannon> Sad thing is that if it's on Kinect then any dance game can download an MJ set unless it's licensed to a particular company, so it's nothing to celebrate.
[04:28] <Firestorm> why did they not end on rayman
[04:28] <Firestorm> or trackmania

[04:30] <DrForester> Any other press events tonight or was that it?
[04:30] <Gattsu25> Ubisoft is so fucking odd

[04:31] <Luckett> what a weird way of announcing Rayman
[04:31] <Vic_> Nintendo conference is going to fail, just watch.
[04:31] <Brannon> IN A WORLD
[04:31] <Luckett> can it at all jman though
[04:31] <Wario64> michael jackson game probably isnt a game, it's just a show performance to see his dance numbers
[04:31] <Tony_Parker> Sony has Kevin Butler
[04:31] <jman2050> lol if Ubisoft of all people manages to make Media Molecule their bitch
[04:31] <azentium> andrewpfister- BGE2's redesign is confusing.
[04:31] <Tre`Kage> don't compare littlebigplanet to trackmania
[04:31] <DrForester> Vic, THey ahve Zelda, that's the Instant Win card
[04:31] <azentium> THERE IS HOPE!
[04:31] <Jide> just beat it !
[04:31] <PezRadar> Vic_ - Nintendo could not present and the ywould win E3.. thats how much of a failure a ton of these have been
[04:31] <Tre`Kage> Trackmania's tools are actually usable
[04:31] <Gattsu25> Trackmania made me cum like this one corpse i saw on ogrish
[04:31] <Tre`Kage> and the base game is actually good
[04:31] <Jide> trackmaniaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[04:31] * Kagari- has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)

[04:31] <Jide> haha
[04:31] <jman2050> in an interchangable way

[04:32] <PezRadar> awesome
[04:32] <Tre`Kage> the tools seem to work with each game
[04:32] <PezRadar> my work computer died

[04:32] * Noss has quit IRC (Quit: )
[04:32] <Luckett> is that now something else or...

[04:32] <jman2050> and from Ubisoft?

[04:34] <BJ-Raw> Orton's healed up enough to wrestle a real match?
[04:34] <ryaxnb> this was such a fail conference
[04:34] <EGM92> FREE THE OT!
[04:34] <Brannon> It's not a failure yet, there are two major contenders left!
[04:34] <EGM92> If GAF can't handle gaming + OT then it shouldn't be allowed to choose!
[04:34] <impiri> so what did you guys think of the laser tag game

[04:35] <bluemaxwork> the bar isnt very high at this point
[04:35] <jman2050> what kind of cruel irony would that be?
[04:35] <Bob_Coffee> Nintendo will just show zelda. that will be the extent of the confrence.

[04:38] <Brannon> Rayman has smacking. Smacking can do no wrong.
[04:38] <minty> jide: did you get your ps3 back yet
[04:38] <ryaxnb> rayman was cool

[04:41] <Jide> tre` where do i sign up for trackmania beta
[04:41] <ryaxnb> their analysis is so poor.
[04:41] <Tre`Kage> Jide: doesn't start until the end of this year
[04:41] <Tre`Kage> so who knows
[04:41] <Tre`Kage> I WANT IT NOW though
[04:41] <ryaxnb> g4 is idiots.
[04:42] <Jide> time to steal the e3 build
[04:42] <Jide> lets go
[04:42] <thesoapster> g4 is such a terrible channel
[04:42] <Jide> if there is one
[04:42] <Jide> lol
[04:42] <minty> at least he is getting paid to be a tool unlike jtyettis
[04:42] <thesoapster> i actually get it now for the first time ever
[04:42] <Tre`Kage> yes
[04:42] <dead> dayum
[04:42] <thesoapster> watched some of the e3 coverage
[04:42] <dead> rayman origins looks great
[04:42] <thesoapster> fucking hell it was stupiod
[04:42] <thesoapster> time waster
[04:42] <EGM92> lol
[04:42] <Shinobi_LeMans> g4 just reflects the sickingly immature game industry on the whole
[04:42] <thesoapster> though morgan webb is rawr
[04:42] <EGM92> soap the MS conf was hilariously bad
[04:42] <thesoapster> that guy dancing around
[04:42] <Tony_Parker> Virgil rasslin action
[04:42] <thesoapster> was fucking hilarious
[04:42] <thesoapster> already in my youtube faves
[04:43] <minty> so, who's getting the new 360 slim. jobber?
[04:43] <thesoapster> i had to rewatch ravi drums after that
[04:43] <BJ-Raw> virgil's got a bump or two in him
[04:43] <nerbo> anyone know how much Gamestop gives for a 360 Pro + 20GB HDD?
[04:43] <minty> it's black and shinny
[04:43] <Tony_Parker> no
[04:43] <ryaxnb> the 360 slim isnt a price drop.
[04:43] <thesoapster> holy fuck that was horrible drum playing. i can bust out a beat 100x better than that and i'm a n00b
[04:43] <ryaxnb> to me thats a lol move.
[04:43] <thesoapster> that wasn't even a beat
[04:43] <thesoapster> it was him like...
[04:43] <thesoapster> flailing around
[04:43] <nerbo> I'm getting a slim... my 360 is just coming back after RROD and I need more HDD space
[04:43] <ryaxnb> I expected a $200 slim with HDD or $300 with HDD and Natal.
[04:43] <EGM92> soap you in?
[04:43] <Mandoric> 360 slim is a price rise
[04:43] <thesoapster> yes logging in
[04:43] <Mandoric> no arcade yet
[04:43] <Shinobi_LeMans> lulz
[04:43] <minty> i want it just for that fact that it's supposed to be more quiet
[04:43] <ryaxnb> i know its so stupid.
[04:43] <thesoapster> EGM92: want to pick the server?
[04:43] <Brannon> Hours later, still can't get over the 360 Slim bribery. It takes serious brass ones to be that blatant with a straight face.
[04:43] <minty> i can't stand my current 360's fan noise
[04:43] <thesoapster> i know how picky you get :p
[04:43] <ryaxnb> i mean c'mon.
[04:43] <Shinobi_LeMans> 360's been slow as molasses with it's price dropping
[04:44] <TheNatural> best games today: Rayman and NFS: HP
[04:44] <Shinobi_LeMans> no reason to think it was gonna pick up now
[04:44] <Tre`Kage> http://www.maniaplanet.com/
[04:44] <TheNatural> ironically, the only two games that werent shooters or casual
[04:44] <ryaxnb> they should cover e3 on 810AM.
[04:44] <ryaxnb> KGO-AM.

[04:49] <Shinobi_LeMans> so er
[04:49] <Dork-Volt> Will there be enough Slims in the market at launch or is this a pre-order wait-in-line thing?
[04:49] <RagnarokX> Tre, the point was that there is a trackmania for consoles... well, A console
[04:50] <Dork-Volt> It better not be that, five years into this generation.
[04:50] <ryaxnb> g4 is the only place to get the post-show interviews!
[04:50] <ryaxnb> :(
[04:50] <Shinobi_LeMans> does trackmania 360 needs the bombnect?

[04:51] <KTallguy> Man I want that new 360... but I want to wait for whatever arcade cheap version
[04:51] <HK-47> Tre has gone insane
[04:51] <threi-laptop> my opinion changed on 360 slim
[04:51] <threi-laptop> it looks pretty decent
[04:51] <Brannon> Then that is great news.
[04:51] <Shinobi_LeMans> it's hilarious how overpriced 360's still are
[04:51] <Brannon> Trackmania day one@
[04:51] <Shinobi_LeMans> well
[04:51] <Jide> its awesome if you never bought a 360
[04:51] <minty> som: i guess the super elite come with 250 gig hdds

[04:53] <nerbo> guess I'll end up keeping my pooey RROD'd and refurbed 360
[04:53] <Dork-Volt> nerbo: I feel your pain.
[04:53] <jman2050> Tre is fapping to Trackmania goodness

[04:54] <Dork-Volt> Uhh, well, can I pre-order a 360S?
[04:54] <minty> he is ranked like #5 or something
[04:54] <HadesGigas> http://www.gametrailers.com/video/e3-2010-xbox-live/101418 why couldn't MS play this during their conference?
[04:54] <Dork-Volt> Do I have to pay full-priced for that or just a deposit?
[04:54] <RagnarokX> Twisted Metal will never be as good as Twisted Metal 2
[04:54] <minty> but this is twisted metal X!
[04:54] <minty> x makes it automatically better
[04:54] <Somnia> can only reserve the new kinect bundles

[04:55] <Somnia> minty: were ranked 67 as of this week =)
[04:55] <Tony_Parker> not gonna happen
[04:55] <RagnarokX> you mean a shinobi game like the old ones, right? Not the new ones?
[04:55] <Dork-Volt> So no pre-order for just Slims.
[04:55] <minty> nice
[04:55] <minty> gotta crap the top 50
[04:55] <minty> crack
[04:55] <Tony_Parker> the dreamcast version that never got made was the last
[04:55] <Somnia> no dork
[04:55] <Shinobi_LeMans> with our luck it'd probably be alex kidd in shinobi world 2 for wii
[04:55] <Somnia> apparently some stores got the slims in today
[04:55] <Dork-Volt> So, will there be enough to go around, Somnia? I'd like to know that.
[04:55] * MrPing1000 has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[04:55] <Shinobi_LeMans> or cyber shinobi 2 for ds
[04:55] <Somnia> No clue dork
[04:55] <Somnia> =P
[04:55] <Dork-Volt> Hmm.
[04:55] <Dork-Volt> Just speculating.
[04:56] <Somnia> I would assume 6 per store
[04:56] <Somnia> unless high volume
[04:56] <Dork-Volt> It'd be lousy to run out of these slims so quickly.
[04:56] <minty> lo: you gonna sell your 360?
[04:56] <nerbo> hmm
[04:56] <Dork-Volt> Maybe.
[04:56] <Somnia> I'll stop calling you dork now
[04:56] <Somnia> hehe
[04:56] <Dork-Volt> My 360 is kind of...
[04:56] <Dork-Volt> You can call me dork.
[04:56] <threi-laptop> i want to trade in my 360 for a slim
[04:56] <Tony_Parker> no slims on amazon :(
[04:56] <Vic_> No one should except anything good from Sega anymore outside Arcade machines games.
[04:56] <minty> yeah..not yet jobber
[04:56] <nerbo> Driver: San Francisco could be cool... maybe...
[04:56] <RagnarokX> Sega should make a new shinobi game, and a new Sonic game. 16 years is a long time to wait
[04:56] <nerbo> prolly not... but maybe
[04:56] <Dork-Volt> You can pre-order a slim on GameStop online, full price.
[04:56] <Somnia> ya
[04:56] <Dork-Volt> My 360 is... well, a jet engine.
[04:56] <Tony_Parker> no wai
[04:56] <Shinobi_LeMans> if it has a free cruise mode nerb, I'm all over it
[04:56] <minty> amazong will put it up after 3 am est
[04:57] <jakehk> whats sony got tomorrow
[04:57] <Tony_Parker> not sure if i want
[04:57] <Dork-Volt> And I might be able to get some per diem coming soon.
[04:57] <minty> that's when they usually refresh their website
[04:57] <Shinobi_LeMans> the 'shift' thing is balls though
[04:57] <Dork-Volt> If so, hey, why not.
[04:57] <Shinobi_LeMans> straight up

[04:57] <alr1ght> how in the fuck did they not manage to put an internal power brick in the not-so-slim? Even the PStwo has one.
[04:57] <Brannon> Sega can still release Gunblade NY/LA and have some dignity left. Which will be soon so that's cool.
[04:57] <minty> jobber: it's shiny
[04:57] <dead> AC brotehrhood confirmed for awesome

[04:57] <thesoapster> lol
[04:57] <Bob_Coffee> there is only one thing that can redeem sega. VF5:FS ps triple/360 port, good online, bitching training mode, and replay mode from VF5 arcade.

[05:30] <Vic_> darkh23: Just like the Wii at it's E3 revealing, it's all going to be about the guests impressions.
[05:30] <Tony_Parker> W O R M
[05:31] <TheNatural> Ryan Moore, product marketing manager for Xbox, told GameSpot that both models are also being discontinued. Once they leave the retail channel, the new slimline Xbox 360 will be the sole Xbox mode on the market--for a time. Moore said that Microsoft is currently working on a second new Xbox 360, which will be offered at the arcade's price point of $200. He declined to say what functionalities the 
[05:31] <TheNatural> cheaper model would or would not have. 
[05:31] <TheNatural> SKU a mania
[05:31] <Unison> lol
[05:31] <Tony_Parker> Super Elite
[05:31] <threi-laptop> price increase
[05:31] <Unison> it's pretty fucking obvious that the gaming press as they are now are being rendered irrelevant
[05:31] <darkh23> with wii you could see the games and see people playing them and how they worked...with 3DS you can't see any of that shit
[05:31] <Unison> haha
[05:31] <Somnia> super elite is just ffxiii and splinter cell versions 
[05:31] <TheNatural> there will be like 10 different versions of 360 by the time its all over
[05:32] <Somnia> how many versions have there been
[05:32] <priz> so are there any pictures of a slimline 360 compared to a regular 360?
[05:32] <Somnia> pro
[05:32] <Somnia> regular
[05:32] <TheNatural> poor virgil, no more wwe paydays

[05:33] <TheNatural> what was the 360 regular?
[05:33] <nerbo> 60GB PS3 FTW
[05:33] <Unison> hope new xbox is flashable

[05:35] <Vic_> Not that ad....
[05:35] <TheNatural> Moore also said that going forward, all future models of the Xbox 360 would not have names and would only be designated by their memory capacity. He decline to elaborate on whether that meant that all future 360s would have a hard drive of some sort. Moore also said that going forward, all future models of the Xbox 360 would not have names and would only be designated by their memory...
[05:35] <TheNatural> ...capacity. He decline to elaborate on whether that meant that all future 360s would have a hard drive of some sort. 
[05:35] <TheNatural> how did that paste twice, hmm

[05:36] <Shinobi_LeMans> one of the best ever
[05:36] <TheNatural> different hard drives for everything, yay
[05:36] <Tony_Parker> i'm not buying another rrod machine
[05:36] <DrForester> Did MS comment on transfering memmory from current Xbox to slim?  Guessing smae HD wont work?
[05:36] <Shinobi_LeMans> SMILE YOU SONOFABITCH
[05:36] <Somnia> its a new HDD
[05:36] <nerbo> eh fuck it
[05:36] <Somnia> internal
[05:36] <nerbo> not gonna buy the Slim right now
[05:36] <TheNatural> doesnt say
[05:36] <impiri> forester: use hdd transfer kit
[05:36] <Nikashi> DrForester : It will probably use the standard USB transfer cable already available
[05:36] <nerbo> my RROD'd unit will work till it's bust again
[05:36] <ryaxnb> slim is the worst i could possibly imagine
[05:36] <nerbo> then I'll prolly buy the Slim
[05:36] <impiri> ign confirms it
[05:36] <DrForester> "Internal" (were goign to be awesome like SOny and allow self upgrades" Or "Internal" (we're Microsoft piss off)
[05:37] <Vic_> Man, the way they've unvieled the slim was boring as fuck
[05:37] <Nikashi> the latter
[05:37] <Nikashi> it's still a custom drive
[05:37] <Nikashi> *enclosure
[05:37] <TheNatural> activisions press conference is in like an hour 20 right?
[05:37] <impiri> The whole MS conference was lackluster for some reason

[05:43] <jett> he was so fake in his delivery
[05:43] * Anathema has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[05:43] <Vic_> fake?
[05:43] <jett> not fake
[05:43] <jett> shit.
[05:43] <ryaxnb> kinect is a big fail.
[05:43] <jett> shit in his delivery
[05:43] <ryaxnb> i just think ms has resigned this to the casuals.
[05:43] <ryaxnb> and im not sure why.
[05:43] <Tre`Kage> I wonder if someone will have a live demo with Nexon
[05:44] <Tre`Kage> Vindictus and Dragon Nest
[05:44] <Tre`Kage> get hype
[05:44] <KTallguy> that's what people said about Wii though
[05:44] <ryaxnb> there are some real possibilties there, like golf and snowboarding, 
[05:44] <ryaxnb> KTallguy, no.
[05:44] * Killthee has quit IRC (Quit: Killthee)
[05:44] <ryaxnb> KTallguy, a launch game announced with wii was Metroid and Zelda.
[05:44] * Anathema has joined #ga
[05:44] <ryaxnb> those arent casual games, but MS doesnt have one hardcore game for kinect. not one.
[05:44] <ryaxnb> they havent demoed one.
[05:44] <Vic_> jett: more like we was wondering what the fuck he was doing there
[05:45] <ryaxnb> now metroid didnt launch with the wii, but it was planned to.
[05:45] <TheNatural> does the difference between wii and kinect really need to be pointed out? lol
[05:45] * Newduck has joined #ga
[05:45] <KTallguy> 3rd party has it kind of
[05:45] <KTallguy> but yea
[05:45] <ryaxnb> KTallguy, the only hardcore game for kinect - and its stretching it - is Joyride.
[05:45] <ryaxnb> and frankly, controlling a car with your hands around nothing sounds stupid.
[05:46] <HK-47> Wii also had Trauma Center, which is about as hardcore as it gets
[05:46] <ryaxnb> i would have believed a lot more in it if they showed Shaun White Skateboarding or Tiger or Madden 11.
[05:46] <KTallguy> you mean kinect exclusive ?
[05:46] <Tony_Parker> woulda lol if Edge's pyro went off
[05:47] <ryaxnb> KTallguy, no, if they just showed them running on kinect.
[05:47] <ryaxnb> exclusive or not.
[05:47] <Lo-Volt> The hilarious part of Shaun White was how he was supposed to defeat a tyrannical Orwellian state with boarding.
[05:47] <Lo-Volt> Is Green Day performing?
[05:47] <ryaxnb> Lo-Volt, its exactly like the plot of Revolution X
[05:47] <nerbo> I think Kinect is a missed opportunity for a really easy to navigate tv web browser
[05:47] <ryaxnb> only that was Aerosmith.
[05:47] <Lo-Volt> With Aerosmith?
[05:47] <nerbo> not that'd ever happen
[05:47] <Lo-Volt> See, that's why I'd fund it will billions if I had it.
[05:47] <soakrates> hey when does that SSF4 patch go live
[05:47] <Lo-Volt> Because, Aerosmith.
[05:47] <KTallguy> hmmm yea
[05:47] <KTallguy> we'll see 
[05:47] <nerbo> but would be great to grab and scroll pages
[05:47] <Lo-Volt> Also, call me when someone makes a T-Pain game.
[05:47] <nerbo> pinch and zoom, etc.
[05:47] <KTallguy> I mean I'm not a big kinect supporter or anything
[05:48] <KTallguy> but man
[05:48] <Vic_> nerbo: just how would you input text with that thing?
[05:48] <KTallguy> if they bundle it for xmas people may buy it 
[05:48] <KTallguy> I dunno
[05:48] <Lo-Volt> Maybe.
[05:48] <nerbo> wireless keyboard, or the chatpad
[05:48] <Lo-Volt> But you have to do a LOT in those games, it seems.
[05:48] <ryaxnb> KTallguy, as it is, wii had many hardcore games on launch or demoed at launch- metroid, red steel, zelda, and some other games like Madden 07.
[05:48] <nerbo> wouldn't do much in the way of text input I'm sure
[05:48] <Lo-Volt> 'Wave to log in.'
[05:48] <ryaxnb> now, they werent that great (except zelda and metroid) but it showed commitment to the hardcore.
[05:49] <ryaxnb> to at least try and show them how to use motion controls in a big, epic game.
[05:49] <nerbo> but iPad has proven that people are often happy with easy to nav browsing, even with sub-par text input
[05:49] * centracore has joined #ga
[05:49] <Tony_Parker> lol @ Khali
[05:49] <soakrates> Wii sucks
[05:49] <ryaxnb> soakrates, no.
[05:49] <KTallguy> I don't think we will buy it
[05:49] <BJ-Raw> hehe TP
[05:49] <BJ-Raw> and Mizzark
[05:49] <soakrates> yes
[05:49] <KTallguy> I think random plebs will buy it
[05:49] <KTallguy> like the Wii
[05:49] <Tre`Kage> MANIA PLANET TRAILER
[05:49] <ryaxnb> soakrates, i am a nintendo fan.
[05:49] <nerbo> good opportunity there I think for MS to pitch Kinect as a web TV
[05:49] <ryaxnb> i am a Gamespot Sheep.
[05:49] <soakrates> ryaxnb: no shit?
[05:49] <Tre`Kage> http://www.gametrailers.com/video/e3-2010-maniaplanet/101448
[05:49] <Tre`Kage> FAP FAP FAP FAP
[05:49] <ryaxnb> i like Sony too.
[05:50] <ryaxnb> and i like some MS franchises, just not kinect.
[05:50] <Tony_Parker> that man threw you off a car ..don't salute him!
[05:50] <soakrates> I hate Kinect
[05:50] <soakrates> because I hate waggle
[05:50] <Newduck> kohan!
[05:50] <soakrates> anyway
[05:50] <soakrates> when's Rockstar's show or whatever
[05:50] <soakrates> I needs me some Max Payne 3 media
[05:50] <ryaxnb> for instance, halo is fun, AoE (PC) is fun
[05:50] <ryaxnb> its not waggle
[05:50] * sprsk has joined #ga
[05:50] <soakrates> well whatever
[05:51] <ryaxnb> its motion control, and its SERIOUS BIZNESS.
[05:51] <soakrates> gimmicky motion controls or whatever
[05:51] <nerbo> I'd like to see a RTS built fromt he ground up for Kinect
[05:51] <soakrates> all the same shit to me
[05:51] <ryaxnb> its not gimmicky if its sony or nintendo's stuff.
[05:51] <ghst> why nerbo.
[05:51] <soakrates> yes it is
[05:51] <ryaxnb> they have a tech that can be used in innovative ways,
[05:51] <soakrates> har
[05:51] <soakrates> anyway
[05:51] <ryaxnb> You think golfing with the wiimote is a gimmick?
[05:51] <nerbo> or something like Carsaconne, or Settlers of Catan, revamped for Kinect
[05:51] <Vic_> nerbo: my issue with Kinect is it's lack of fine precision
[05:51] <ghst> it's slow and imprecise. 
[05:51] <soakrates> yea
[05:51] <ryaxnb> Its simulating actual golfing. Thats no gimmick.
[05:51] <soakrates> as a matter of fact I do
[05:51] <ghst> why is that good for rts?
[05:51] <sprsk> is there gonna be an official off topic thread
[05:51] <soakrates> it's great for golfing 
[05:51] <soakrates> and uh
[05:52] <soakrates> that's about it
[05:52] <soakrates> so if you REALLY LIKE GOLF
[05:52] <soakrates> you're in hog heaven
[05:52] <BJ-Raw> Golf!
[05:52] <ryaxnb> soakrates, well its good for many more things
[05:52] <BJ-Raw> I really like golf ^_^
[05:52] <nerbo> I'm open to gesture control, if it's done well and designed for it from the ground up
[05:52] <nerbo> I also think it makes sense for UI navigation
[05:52] <soakrates> sides
[05:52] <BJ-Raw> Tiger 10 Wii was okay, thank goodness it let you do a preview swing to see what power % you got
[05:52] <ryaxnb> Like i feel so natural control NSMBwiis tilting platforms or performing the spin move in SMG
[05:52] <squarepeg> So, PS3 price drop tomorrow in light of Xbox slim 250 GB for $299?
[05:52] <soakrates> golfing with wiimote wasn't any more fun to me than golfing with a controller or a mouse
[05:53] <Unison> only a little waggle is fine
[05:53] <ryaxnb> or catching soccer balls in Mario Strikers
[05:53] <soakrates> but anyway
[05:53] <nerbo> would I buy Kinect for anything shown thus far? fuck no
[05:53] <Unison> people complain when waggle could be a button
[05:53] <Unison> but that is usually when it works best
[05:53] <Unison> lol
[05:53] <nerbo> but I'd certainly like to use ot for the interface navigation
[05:53] <Unison> something like mario spin jump is ideal, no doubt
[05:53] <Tony_Parker> it's a fad
[05:53] <jett> sony is definitely not going below 299
[05:53] <jett> they dropped the price recently
[05:53] <Vic_> Ever lasting fad it seems
[05:53] <nerbo> eventually, when Kinect is built in and bundled standard, it'll be a lot more appealing
[05:54] <jett> they will offer a new ps3 configuration with a 250GB at 299
[05:54] <Lo-Volt> By then, the generation will be over.
[05:54] <nerbo> it's clearly going to be standardized next gen
[05:54] <Tre`Kage> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=398300 -- inflammatory thread title ftw
[05:54] <soakrates> also
[05:54] <nerbo> right now it's like runble packs for N64
[05:54] <nerbo> fucking retarded
[05:54] <soakrates> who are all these people in here I've never seen before
[05:54] <nerbo> until everyone has it and uses it in everything
[05:54] <soakrates> and how did they find this place
[05:54] <nerbo> and then it will be seen as essential
[05:54] <jett> the kinect shit will never be built in, as it has to be placed in a specific position
[05:54] * soakrates mad-dogs Firestorm
[05:54] <KTallguy> how good is the depth perception on kinect anyway
[05:54] <nerbo> by that logic, wii waggle should never be built in
[05:54] <KTallguy> with eyetoy
[05:55] <Firestorm> what
[05:55] <nerbo> which is exactly why eventually Kinect will be built in
[05:55] <sprsk> KTallguy i hear not so good
[05:55] <KTallguy> you have to hold your hand over a button for a while
[05:55] <jett> tre: where's the insult to console owners. son i am disappoint
[05:55] <Firestorm> why am i being highlighted :(
[05:55] <KTallguy> like how do you click buttons and stuff
[05:55] <KTallguy> that's the concern for me
[05:55] <Tre`Kage> Jett:  I insulted waggle gaming
[05:55] <soakrates> until motion controls can match the precision of "traditional" controls or whatever
[05:55] <Vic_> nerbo: now you're stating the obvious...
[05:55] <soakrates> it's a gimmick
[05:56] <jman2050> Tre: should've put in a shot at LBP somewhere
[05:56] <jett> nerbo: you're not making sense
[05:56] <soakrates> and I don't see that happening any time soon
[05:56] <jman2050> get the sonytards out of the way from the getgo
[05:56] <Lo-Volt> So, Wii price drop to end this fight before it begins? Usually, Nintendo ain't like that.
[05:56] <Lo-Volt> But someone has to put the boot in!
[05:56] <Tre`Kage> oh my god, rewatching this video
[05:56] <Tre`Kage> the new TM2 environments

[06:13] <KTallguy> probably has something to do with history
[06:13] <KTallguy> hnk is OK because they are exploding
[06:13] <KTallguy> it's weird
[06:13] <jman2050> it seems like there are groups and shit against the cartoon porn stuff, it's just completely ineffectual for whatever reason
[06:13] <jman2050> in Japan I mean
[06:13] <KTallguy> well it's $$
[06:14] <KTallguy> and the small set of otaku culture that thrives on it

[06:27] <Amir0x> In the middle of E3 2010, mysterious footage of Zelda Wii's trailer was shown momentarily to get hyped for tomorrow's Nintendo conference.
[06:27] <Amir0x> They showed a couple seconds of gameplay with Miyamoto holding a Wiimote with a Wii Motion Plus, with what appeared to be an adult version of Wind Waker Link brandishing an unfamiliar sword on the screen
[06:27] <Wario64> patapon is boring shit and requires stupid grinding
[06:27] <Tre`Kage> you're doing something wrong then, egm
[06:27] <Amir0x> the graphics seemingly much more sharp and masterfully rendered for the Wii version, but nonetheless, cel shaded. This style was extremely similar Wind Wake
[06:27] <Unison> yes
[06:27] <Unison> agree wario
[06:28] * Diablos has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[06:28] <Wario64> and the music or rhythm thing was annoying
[06:28] <bluemaxmini> i wanted to like patapon so much
[06:28] <Wario64> wanted to mute that game
[06:28] <Unison> i hope it uses Move
[06:28] <bluemaxmini> but the grinding killed it
[06:28] <Unison> hahaha
[06:28] <darkh23> yes yes celda....plz
[06:28] <darkh23> I want to see the tears
[06:28] * Sykra has quit IRC (Ping timeout)

[06:28] <Amir0x> I will drink OBLIVIONS tears so much
[06:28] <Amir0x> <3 Celda
[06:28] <Amir0x> Best looking Zelda game ever

[06:28] <Shinobi_LeMans> well link won't look like a 5 year old this time
[06:28] <Y2Kev> i highly doubt nintendo will do a Celda look
[06:28] <ghst> best zelda game ever.
[06:28] <Y2Kev> the fanbabies exploded when they said that
[06:28] <ghst> even with the shitty bits.

[06:51] <Rorschach> why is bulletstorm getting so much praise?  It looks so generic and the dialogue is embarassing...
[06:51] <bluemaxmini> because thats what gamers want
[06:51] <Tiktaalik> kinda funny that the big sites have seemingly ended their coverage even though there's still the ATVI conference to go. 1up even has a wrap up podcast. The only liveblogs I've found for the ATVI conference are small sites like 4colour rebellion
[06:51] <mac> What chu talking bout cosmicblizzard?

[06:58] <cosmicblizzard> i wonder which one of the dev's daughter that is
[06:58] <PezRadar> then cry
[06:58] <PezRadar> then run off
[06:58] <mac> Good thing it wasn't some old ass rep
[06:58] <mac> like Regie
[06:58] <mac> or Miyamoto
[06:58] <bluemaxmini> thats the little girl from the im a pc commercials
[06:58] <mac> that would just be embarresing
[06:58] <Rorschach> what did bishop's game turn out to be?
[06:58] <ryaxnb> And if Sony doesn't announce prices for Move does it become a retarded game of retail chicken between the two? Whoever blinks first gets fucked on pricing?
[06:58] <PezRadar> fucking twitter
[06:58] <PezRadar> stop breaking
[06:58] <cosmicblizzard> o rly
[06:58] <ryaxnb> thats basically it
[06:58] <ryaxnb> a retarded retail chicken game.
[06:58] <ryaxnb> all about the marketing.
[06:59] <Bob_Coffee> move will hopefully be $50 for dildo controler + vibe chuck, or bundle with eyetoy for $89.99.
[06:59] <ryaxnb> um, what?
[06:59] <ryaxnb> you expect it to be less than wii?
[06:59] <dead> god I think im losing my mind
[06:59] <PezRadar> i love how 'hand it' means
[06:59] <dead> just went on amazon to search for something
[06:59] <PezRadar> "barf it"
[06:59] <mrsolo> http://www.balls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/paraguay.jpg we love worldcup!
[06:59] <ryaxnb> reminder, wiimote +chuck is $70
[06:59] <PezRadar> whe nthe tiger pukes it at her
[06:59] <ryaxnb> no way.
[06:59] <dead> and completel forgot what it was
[06:59] <Joekage> 149 for Kinect right?
[06:59] <dead> completely even
[07:00] <ryaxnb> i predict $50-60 for movemote
[07:00] <ryaxnb> $30 for subcontroller (you can also use dualshock 3)
[07:00] * NewAgeRetroHippie has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)

[07:00] <Rorschach> http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Madridexpo/Misc/fotot.jpg bigger
[07:00] <ryaxnb> and $39 for eye. All together for $99,
[07:00] <Joekage> lmao
[07:00] <Rorschach> don't come with that weak stuff!
[07:00] <Joekage> I love the fact that when the tiger licks the screen she still acts like it's licking her
[07:00] <Rorschach> PSDildo should be under 100 with everything
[07:00] <mac> dammit, I'm at the library
[07:01] <PezRadar> fuckin
[07:01] <ryaxnb> possibly eye+movemote for $79 if they dont bundle the nunchuk to look really cheap
[07:01] <PezRadar> twitter
[07:01] <PezRadar> over capacity bullshit
[07:01] <ryaxnb> imagine $79 for Move vs. $149 for Natal.
[07:01] <mrsolo> Rorschach, i am not worthy i am not worthy!... oh man wow
[07:01] <PezRadar> fucking iphone launch
[07:01] <PezRadar> raping twitter 
[07:01] <Wario64> iphone launch?
[07:01] <Wario64> where?
[07:01] <bluemaxmini> move and kinect will both be over $100
[07:01] <bluemaxmini> book it
[07:01] <Wario64> that's why twitter is dying? fuck
[07:01] <ryaxnb> i in fact predict that if natal is anounced at $99, sony will undercut and make mviove $79
[07:01] <ryaxnb> bluemaxmini, haha no
[07:01] <Rorschach> I thought kinect was confirmed at 150
[07:01] <PezRadar> people thinking midnight it when it starts
[07:01] <KTallguy> yea
[07:01] <ryaxnb> sony has confirmed move is under 100.
[07:02] <KTallguy> if it's 150
[07:02] <KTallguy> fuck
[07:02] <PezRadar> so they are probably crashing twitter
[07:02] <PezRadar> going
[07:02] <mrsolo> Rorschach, funny that her cleavage is big enough to hold a smartphone
[07:02] <PezRadar> WTF APPLE #WTF
[07:02] <ryaxnb> so we know that
[07:02] <ryaxnb> ms has confirmed natal is over $100
[07:02] <Wario64> fail whale
[07:02] <Rorschach> mrsolo: that's the best part!  BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[07:02] <ryaxnb> now this could mean theyre both around $100
[07:02] * buffi has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[07:02] * buffi has joined #ga
[07:02] <ryaxnb> but it also could mean Natal $169 and Move $79 or something like that
[07:02] <Rotanibor> http://twitpic.com/1wwhv3 whats dis
[07:02] <Rorschach> If move is 79, I might bite
[07:02] <ryaxnb> Sony has specifically said: Move under $99
[07:02] <Joekage> Isn't it only the preorder launch?
[07:03] <ryaxnb> with eye included.
[07:03] <Wario64> rot, probably mvc3
[07:03] <PezRadar> Rotanibor a guy playing a game
[07:03] <Rotanibor> hmm think its deadrising actually
[07:03] <Rorschach> I'll bite on that... at least it has games
[07:03] <Rotanibor> no mvc3
[07:03] <Wario64> what else can i tbe
[07:03] <Wario64> if that guy is from capcom
[07:03] * FirewalkR has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[07:03] <Rorschach> natal doesn't have jack... maybe forza, but I'd rather play forza with a fucking wheel
[07:03] <ryaxnb> I predict $99, but if Natal is anounced as $99, sony might revise pricing down to $79
[07:03] <ryaxnb> they can always drop the subcontroller from the bundle.
[07:04] <ryaxnb> thus making it just a $30 camera and a  Wiimote thingy which is about $50
[07:04] <Rorschach> deal breaker if they do that... for me, that is
[07:04] <Joekage> the poncho is what made me not want
[07:04] <ryaxnb> why?
[07:04] <ryaxnb> you can use a dualshock for that
[07:04] <ryaxnb> it works the same way... just use the left side.
[07:04] * FirewalkR has joined #ga
[07:04] <PezRadar> i cant believe
[07:04] <PezRadar> i have to stay up all night
[07:04] <Rorschach> holding the dualshock like that sucks
[07:04] <PezRadar> and wait to see if preordres start for apple
[07:04] * Expy has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[07:04] <PezRadar> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
[07:04] <ryaxnb> yes, but subcontrollers are fairly simple.
[07:04] * tiong_fi has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[07:04] * Tiduz has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[07:04] <ryaxnb> you could always buy one later for like $20 once they go down in price.
[07:04] <Joekage> It should start at around 6am
[07:05] <Rorschach> all or nothing for me!
[07:05] <Rorschach> since I want to use it for stuff like socom
[07:05] <bluemaxmini> go down in price
[07:05] <ryaxnb> hmmm...
[07:05] <bluemaxmini> haha
[07:05] <Rorschach> I wish socom wasn't one of those games where you have to hit the edges to move the camera
[07:05] <mac> Bulletstorm looks solid
[07:05] <Rorschach> so lame
[07:05] <ryaxnb> headtracking is a cool solution to that
[07:05] <Tiktaalik> so apparently free drinks at the ATVI party
[07:05] <ryaxnb> use the good ole body recognition feature of the Eye.
[07:05] <Tiktaalik> according to tweets
[07:05] * Tiduz has joined #ga
[07:06] <Tiktaalik> so thats where some of that 6 million went
[07:06] <Wario64> i cant even load tiwtter
[07:06] <Wario64> wtf
[07:06] * mrsolo has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[07:06] <PezRadar> why
[07:06] <PezRadar> is
[07:06] <PezRadar> twitter
[07:06] <PezRadar> still
[07:06] <Rorschach> they should do that.  It could work with socom, but I wouldn't want it in an fps
[07:06] <PezRadar> down
[07:06] <Tiktaalik> yeah it's fail whaling
[07:06] * mrsolo has joined #ga
[07:06] <ryaxnb> which according to sony, can be used in combo with Move, creating a natal style thing combined with move.
[07:06] <Wario64> doesnt activison have strippers too
[07:06] <Tiktaalik> probably
[07:06] <Rorschach> FPS I'd want like that wii one that came out about the aliens...wtf is it called?
[07:06] <Tiktaalik> they did at GDC
[07:06] <ryaxnb> imagine, kicking your feet and punching with your move controller in a wrestling game.
[07:06] <Tiktaalik> at club bam bam
[07:06] <Narayan> Wow. MOH multiplayer looks exactly like MW1.
[07:06] <Rorschach> came out last year... had some weird ass guns... fuck

[07:06] <Rorschach> yeah that
[07:06] <ryaxnb> the feet would rely on body guessing.
[07:06] <Himuro> jesus chist
[07:07] <Rorschach> the reticle moves the cam just like a normal fps
[07:07] <Wario64> oh shit child of eden supports regular controllers
[07:07] <jakehk> <Himuro> all he does is spam tiger
[07:07] <Joekage> thats what you're supposed to do with sagat

[07:08] <ryaxnb> and they plan in component video on wii, whereas most GC's didnt have the outputs
[07:08] <Firestorm> ah

[07:37] <PezRadar> and choose which one he wanted
[07:37] <PezRadar> as it listed the makes/models
[07:37] <Unison_> can i just say fuck activision?
[07:37] <PezRadar> of each one..

[07:38] <Unison_> also natal dance
[07:38] <Unison_> lol
[07:38] <Wario64> for a laser tag game, it was fucking confusing how they explained it
[07:38] <Wario64> you'd think it would be simple
[07:38] <soakrates> I don't play vidyagames
[07:38] <PezRadar> nothing tops the ubisoft laser tag
[07:38] <PezRadar> and breathing game
[07:38] <PezRadar> those were the most awkward of the day
[07:38] <Unison_> i dont get it at all
[07:38] <PezRadar> the laser tag as he was explaining it
[07:38] <PezRadar> was hilarious
[07:38] <Unison_> you have to run around and scan shit
[07:38] <Unison_> or something
[07:38] <vulva> more awkward than skittles?
[07:38] <Unison_> then  like it will keep score on your pc
[07:38] <Unison_> or something
[07:39] <PezRadar> YOU NEED TO GO HERE.. HIT THIS.. THEN GO BACK HERE AND HIT THIS.. AFTER THAT COME HERE AND HIT THIS.. AND THEN HIT THIS PART AND COME BACK TO THIS POINT AND HIT THIS AND THEN SHOOT THIS.. ok?
[07:39] <Unison_> lol
[07:39] * bluemaxmini has joined #ga
[07:39] <Unison_> flop
[07:39] <mac> skittles was not awkward.  Would you rather have a 48 year old man do those lines?
[07:39] <PezRadar> i was like bluh?!
[07:39] <ghst> laser tag was actually a good idea. just a shame it had nothing todo with video games or anyone over 15.
[07:39] <PezRadar> skittles wasnt awkward
[07:39] <PezRadar> also the breathing game
[07:39] <mac> that's because it was a asian girl
[07:39] <PezRadar> was just weird
[07:39] <mac> everyone wanted to fuxor her
[07:39] <BJ> they got the cutest kid possible to make us not hate on it
[07:39] <PezRadar> "Breath and match the lines.. then we can determine if you are fat or not LOLZ"
[07:40] <PezRadar> i was like wtf?
[07:40] <Wario64> breathing can lose 20 pounds 
[07:40] <Wario64> lol
[07:40] <PezRadar> its like practicing how to smoke weed
[07:40] <vulva> I'd rather skittles have just not happened
[07:40] <PezRadar> and you can do it w/ that game
[07:40] <PezRadar> w/ fake trip outs

[07:44] <Unison_> oh haha
[07:44] <Firestorm> Mibbit uses the same IP for everyone I think
[07:44] <Unison_> the quit message was hilarious
[07:44] <Firestorm> haha what did it say?
[07:44] <PezRadar> why did MS spend 5 mins of my time during their presentation to talk about the Zune
[07:44] <PezRadar> in 360
[07:45] <Unison_> it was like (USER TERMINATED (MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS DETECTED. DORKSNET REJECT))
[07:45] <Unison_> something like that
[07:45] <Unison_> haha
[07:45] <Firestorm> hahaha
[07:45] <Tre`Kage> pubs ftl
[07:45] <PezRadar> Firestorm
[07:45] <Firestorm> well apparently it's just some dorksnet servers. i was on gamecubecafe. browsingtheinternet works fine with mibbit
[07:45] <PezRadar> had multiple irc clients open confirmed
[07:45] <Unison_> yeah haha

[07:45] <PezRadar> Tre`Kage
[07:45] <Firestorm> might make use of that spoiler-free thread and just catch up when i get home.
[07:45] <PezRadar> hi
[07:45] * dead has quit IRC (Quit: )
[07:46] <Unison_> so kinect games have their own boxes, but what about games w/ just some kinect features?
[07:46] <Unison_> are those in normal boxes?
[07:46] <Firestorm> as long as my friends don't text me with their reactions like today
[07:46] <Unison_> half and half?
[07:46] <Tre`Kage> hi pez
[07:46] <ghst> what is dancing in kohan
[07:46] <ghst> and why does it make lactose an asshole?
[07:46] <Tre`Kage> well there's multiple kinds of dancing
[07:46] <Tre`Kage> towndancing is when you engage militia with one unit
[07:46] <Unison_> highlight of e3 for me so far was MS making that little girl say "I love you" to Skittles the Tiger
[07:46] <Tre`Kage> then go around the back
[07:47] <Tre`Kage> and attack the settlement
[07:47] <Unison_> that shit is so slimy and awful hahaha
[07:47] <Tre`Kage> so you capture the town
[07:47] <Tre`Kage> without having to fight the militia
[07:47] <Firestorm> i think i went to take a piss during that Unison
[07:47] <Tre`Kage> pressdancing is when you move a unit around in pressed in another unit's zone of control
[07:47] <mac> she loved her imaginary tiger
[07:47] <Tre`Kage> forcing them to engage
[07:47] <mac> like Calvin
[07:47] <mac> how can you hate?
[07:47] <Tre`Kage> and they'll follow you
[07:47] <Tre`Kage> you walk around them
[07:47] <Unison_> it's just fucking awful
[07:47] <Unison_> making a 5 year old a corporate shill
[07:47] <Tre`Kage> forcing them to run out of morale and rout or not defend/move/whatever
[07:47] <PezRadar> the skittles thing wasnt bad
[07:47] <PezRadar> it was just nintendogs
[07:47] <PezRadar> on a tv
[07:47] <mac> I liked skittles
[07:47] <Unison_> and teaching her that it's okay to say i love you when you don't mean it haha
[07:48] <PezRadar> i mean if a little girl was playing nintendogs alone in her room
[07:48] <PezRadar> she'd do the same thing
[07:48] <Unison_> i think the software was fine
[07:48] <mac> the girl gave us warmth
[07:48] <Tre`Kage> they're both a bit abusive
[07:48] <Unison_> the most impressive thing MS showed
[07:48] <PezRadar> The Star Wars game looked like ass..
[07:48] <ghst> like mg pushing in coh?
[07:48] <Unison_> just ridiculous to make that girl say she loved the tiger
[07:48] <Unison_> hahah
[07:48] <Tre`Kage> no
[07:48] <PezRadar> also not sure on the hate for the Harmonix Dancing..
[07:48] <Tre`Kage> mh pushing can be handled
[07:48] <ghst> more sploitive?
[07:48] <Tre`Kage> yeah
[07:48] <Unison_> harmonix dancing & skittles were the best two "games"
[07:48] <mac> I thought it was suprisingly sweet sell for such a jaded community
[07:48] <PezRadar> the game seemed the most thorough of all of em
[07:48] <Tre`Kage> it's not really allowed in our games
[07:49] <PezRadar> The Ubisoft fitness game had some lag
[07:49] <PezRadar> but looked okay
[07:49] * vulva1 has joined #ga
[07:49] <PezRadar> The racing games and stuff looked zzz
[07:49] <PezRadar> the raft and change your position obstacle course was boring
[07:49] <Unison_> it was all so charmless 
[07:49] <vulva1> then again I think my first message in here when skittles came on was "omg hotness"
[07:49] <Newduck> he wasnt dancing that much but
[07:49] <PezRadar> itd be fun for the first 3 mins
[07:49] <Unison_> that rare shit
[07:49] <mac> New star wars game?  The MMO?
[07:49] <Newduck> still full of shit
[07:49] <PezRadar> then you would be like 'fuck this shit'
[07:49] <Unison_> was just aful
[07:49] <Unison_> haha
[07:49] <Unison_> awful
[07:49] <PezRadar> But man
[07:49] <PezRadar> after seeing the German guys
[07:49] <PezRadar> play MOVE
[07:49] * vulva has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[07:49] <PezRadar> i dunno
[07:49] <Tre`Kage> the one thing I saw him do
[07:49] <Unison_> lol
[07:49] <PezRadar> PS Move looks so bad
[07:49] <Unison_> that is awful too
[07:49] <PezRadar> i cant even compare it 
[07:49] <Tre`Kage> was engage militia
[07:49] <Unison_> looks insanely bad
[07:49] <Tre`Kage> then retreat to jungle
[07:49] <Tre`Kage> for the defensive bonus
[07:50] <PezRadar> like the Move Sports stuff
[07:50] <PezRadar> was TERRIBLE
[07:50] <Tre`Kage> I dunno if that's all that bad
[07:50] <PezRadar> like at least MS and Wii make it cartooney
[07:50] <PezRadar> with your avatars
[07:50] <Unison_> yeah, it's just completely soulless
[07:50] <Unison_> haha
[07:50] <Tre`Kage> but still kind of abusive
[07:50] <PezRadar> but PS Move was like
[07:50] <ghst> do the militia follow that far?
[07:50] <PezRadar> REAL LIFE PEOPLE
[07:50] <PezRadar> MODELS
[07:50] <PezRadar> IT WILL WORK
[07:50] <Tre`Kage> they can

[07:51] <Tiduz> PezRadar lolll
[07:51] <Tre`Kage> it's basically straight up magic
[07:51] <HandsomeHomeless> but how do they put that in softwarew
[07:51] <Tre`Kage> but without the deck editing
[07:51] <Tre`Kage> turn based stuff isn't hard at all

[08:11] * Expy has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[08:12] <PezRadar> when i managed the gamestop show

[08:12] <Wario64> whats the story on the guy sleeping on g4
[08:12] <Chemo> anyone know if G4 is actually showing the conferences tomorrow, or if they're just doing some trailers/etc coverage
[08:12] <PezRadar> they invited the guyw ho plays the uh
[08:12] <PezRadar> sgt dude from avatar
[08:12] <PezRadar> the one that is all evil
[08:12] <PezRadar> and all he did was lecture everyone

[08:12] <PezRadar> no gameplay
[08:12] <Tony_Parker> they're showing everything Chemo
[08:12] <PezRadar> no nothing
[08:12] <Unison_> intern was hilarious
[08:12] <KTallguy> kohan people
[08:12] <Unison_> haha
[08:12] <EGM92> the problem with the alienware is that it's now worth just over 4000$ and no one would even consider offering 2000$
[08:12] <PezRadar> just lectured everyone
[08:12] <Tony_Parker> no commercials
[08:12] <KTallguy> the game looks kind of slowpaced in the trailers
[08:12] <PezRadar> 2000+ people
[08:12] <Chemo> Thanks, Tony
[08:12] <PezRadar> for 20 mins
[08:12] <PezRadar> i twas TERRIBLE

[08:13] <Tony_Parker> tomorrow the Natal shit is on MTV commercial free
[08:13] <Tony_Parker> 3:30
[08:14] <PezRadar> that stream needs more breathing games

[08:14] <PezRadar> and games where u can teleport to other cars
[08:14] <PezRadar> for free
[08:14] <vulva> fine, 40 bucks
[08:14] <EGM92> I'll slash your throat

[08:16] <PezRadar> Joekage i think uses the 2nd one
[08:16] <Tony_Parker> poor blue jays
[08:16] <EGM92> well joe?
[08:17] <Nikashi> a low block should defeat it
[08:17] <EGM92> which one is it?
[08:17] <Nikashi> just keep blocking
[08:17] <Nikashi> not just BACK
[08:17] <Nikashi> back + down
[08:17] <PezRadar> yea
[08:17] <PezRadar> he will attempt to frame trap you
[08:17] <EGM92> If he hits me once it's over
[08:17] <Tony_Parker> they were in a tornado warning and a earthquake in 5 days
[08:17] <EGM92> I can't go down and block
[08:17] <PezRadar> so that he can counter attack
[08:17] <PezRadar> the best u can do is down and block
[08:17] <PezRadar> and crouch tech correctly
[08:17] <Nikashi> crouch block when he gets close and be ready to tech throw
[08:17] <Nikashi> yeah
[08:17] <PezRadar> cuz he will tick into throws sometimes
[08:17] <Nikashi> SEE PEZ I KNOW STUFF
[08:17] <EGM92> tech throw?
[08:18] <PezRadar> block a throw
[08:18] <Nikashi> throw him back if he throws you
[08:18] <Tony_Parker> throw block
[08:18] <PezRadar> with your own throw
[08:18] <PezRadar> Technical Hit
[08:18] <Nikashi> you usually get a frame or 200 if it's Gouken's back throw haha
[08:18] <PezRadar> with the little ding that comes between ur chars
[08:18] <EGM92> Nik in english...
[08:18] * Armitage has quit IRC (Quit: )
[08:18] <Chemo> you guys playing on 360 or ps3?
[08:18] <Nikashi> if they throw you
[08:18] <PezRadar> if they attempt to throw you
[08:18] <Nikashi> you have a moment or so to counter it
[08:18] <EGM92> Pez hard to do with a back
[08:18] <Tony_Parker> both
[08:18] <Nikashi> by throwing
[08:18] <EGM92> esp PS3 triggers
[08:19] <Tiduz> i hate gouken
[08:19] * Expy has joined #ga
[08:19] <Nikashi> well don't use a shit controller

[08:19] <EGM92> Tiduz I'm getting better but fuck
[08:19] <Nikashi> Tiduz : I can play him okay
[08:19] <Nikashi> Oh
[08:19] <Nikashi> Pez
[08:19] <PezRadar> EGM92 - Joe is pretty good
[08:19] <Tiduz> i hate playing against him i mean
[08:19] * Unison_ has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[08:19] <PezRadar> so u gotta remember that
[08:19] <EGM92> I got his knew combo down
[08:19] <Tiduz> stupid counter moves
[08:19] <Tiduz> fffuu
[08:19] <Nikashi> how should I follow up a Denjin after a back throw?
[08:19] <EGM92> if my controller decides to work
[08:19] <Nikashi> dash in tatsu or?
[08:19] <EGM92> yes
[08:19] <PezRadar> back throw?
[08:19] <PezRadar> with gouken?
[08:20] <Tony_Parker> toss
[08:20] <Nikashi> yeah 
[08:20] <Nikashi> his big over head toss
[08:20] <PezRadar> Tatsu. or you can ultra 2
[08:20] <PezRadar> or ultra 1..
[08:20] <EGM92> direction + throw
[08:20] <Nikashi> nono
[08:20] <Nikashi> I mean AFTER you hit the ultra 2
[08:20] <Nikashi> there's a wall bounce
[08:20] <PezRadar> oh
[08:20] <PezRadar> depends on your position
[08:20] <PezRadar> but yea tatsu
[08:20] <Nikashi> kk
[08:20] <EGM92> tatsu
[08:20] <Nikashi> that's what I figured
[08:20] <Joekage> sorry
[08:20] <Joekage> oh that combop
[08:20] <Joekage> i use
[08:20] <PezRadar> cr. lp cr. lp cr. mp CU?
[08:20] <Nikashi> I love EX SRK > dash tatsu with gouken
[08:20] <EGM92> ex punch + mid fireball + tatsu is great.
[08:20] <Nikashi> but there's like 3 characters it won't work on
[08:21] <PezRadar> Nikashi yea
[08:21] <Joekage> st mp cr jab cr mp, into uppah or ruffian fadc ex uppah
[08:21] <PezRadar> I usually just do ex shoryu to shoryu
[08:21] <PezRadar> with gouken
[08:21] <Nikashi> yeah
[08:21] <Nikashi> that works
[08:21] <Nikashi> but doesn't look as spiffy hehe
[08:21] <EGM92> pez that's easy
[08:21] <Nikashi> sometimes I use it to fake out a demon flip jump in too
[08:21] <PezRadar> EGM92
[08:21] <EGM92> but the ex shoryu + mid fireball kocks him back up
[08:21] <Nikashi> EX SRK I mean
[08:21] <PezRadar> joe uses St. MP
[08:21] <EGM92> dash in and tatsu
[08:21] <PezRadar> to open up the jump ins
[08:21] <Nikashi> do that, bounce them up, demon flip
[08:21] <PezRadar> if he doesnt do a deep jump in..
[08:21] <PezRadar> you can usually throw him
[08:22] <PezRadar> before the st. mp comes out
[08:22] <PezRadar> because it has a slower start up
[08:22] <Joekage> yep
[08:22] <EGM92> deep jump in?
[08:22] <PezRadar> a jump in that comes in deep into your char
[08:22] <Joekage> as in when i hit you, if the attack hits your chest or below
[08:22] <PezRadar> where he can combo the next hit in
[08:22] <Nikashi> How can you know Gouken combos and not know basic terms EGM
[08:22] <PezRadar> but if he does a higher jump in
[08:22] <PezRadar> and kinda screws up
[08:22] <PezRadar> you can do a throw
[08:22] <PezRadar> before he does st. mp
[08:22] <EGM92> Nik because you're a fucking whore
[08:22] <PezRadar> because st. mp takes a while to come out
[08:22] <EGM92> that's why
[08:22] <EGM92> how*
[08:23] <Joekage> Gotta watch out if I use jabs though
[08:23] <PezRadar> yea
[08:23] <PezRadar> if he jumps in deep or not
[08:23] <PezRadar> and uses a jab
[08:23] <PezRadar> then you can get counter hit
[08:23] <PezRadar> if you throw
[08:23] <EGM92> the point punch lol
[08:23] <Joekage> also when you're in the corner against Cody, just block
[08:23] <EGM92> pointy
[08:23] <kassatsu> giving out a joe danger code this week in honor of e3 :)
[08:23] <EGM92> sometimes I can get a counter in

[08:46] <PezRadar> i never have issues with vegas now
[08:46] <Joekage> all because i knew how to block
[08:46] <PezRadar> thanks to AZ Greg
[08:46] <Nikashi> she has a crossup which makes her 10000000 times better
[08:46] <PezRadar> so soon as a vega appears
[08:46] <Joekage> sakura is fucking amazing in this game
[08:46] <PezRadar> its like FRESH MEAT
[08:46] <Nikashi> Joekage : I hit EX Tatsu > U2 on Tony heh
[08:46] <Joekage> once you hit a combo it's like hell yeah
[08:46] <Nikashi> yep
[08:46] <Nikashi> :D
[08:46] <vulva> cody sucks
[08:46] <Tony_Parker> Sakura?
[08:47] <PezRadar> cody and sakura
[08:47] <Nikashi> Tony_Parker : Yeah you won that but I did hit her pop up Ultra heh
[08:47] <PezRadar> her shenanigans are easy to read now
[08:47] <Joekage> dont make me hurt you vulva
[08:47] <PezRadar> sinc ethe setups are all over the internets
[08:47] <Joekage> i dont do mixups with sakura
[08:47] <Tony_Parker> whiff 2nd time
[08:47] <Nikashi> yeah
[08:47] <Joekage> better to just otoshi and deal damage then reset
[08:47] <Tony_Parker> key to Sakura
[08:47] <Nikashi> I was kinda guessing
[08:47] <Tony_Parker> air HK
[08:47] <Nikashi> I know
[08:47] <Nikashi> I hit you with that a few times
[08:47] <PezRadar> key to sakura is pressure
[08:47] <Nikashi> just did a neutral jump
[08:47] <PezRadar> shes like cody
[08:47] <PezRadar> lol
[08:47] <Tony_Parker> spam spam spam
[08:47] <PezRadar> shes female cody
[08:47] <Nikashi> and smacked you just before I landed
[08:47] <Joekage> yeah which is why I use her
[08:48] <Nikashi> PezRadar : He was playing Ibuki
[08:48] <Joekage> no defense
[08:48] <Nikashi> so I was scared to get in too close
[08:48] <Joekage> crazy offense
[08:48] <Nikashi> The 2nd time I played Dan though
[08:48] <Nikashi> I rocked
[08:48] <Nikashi> like hit everything I wanted
[08:48] <Tony_Parker> all i played in sf4 was Sakura and Boxer
[08:48] <PezRadar> ibuki is fun
[08:48] <PezRadar> but i have no idea
[08:48] <PezRadar> how anyone gets her lp into mk combos down
[08:48] <Nikashi> I need to do her trials
[08:48] <Noss> wait a min..that really happened...lazer tag...and some odd meditation clasp?  Did that really happen?
[08:48] <PezRadar> it must be a 1 frame link
[08:48] <PezRadar> cuz that shit is impossible
[08:48] <Nikashi> Noss what are you talking about
[08:49] <Tiduz> apple nl store still down
[08:49] <Noss> thinking of e3...my bad, nikashi.
[08:49] <PezRadar> Noss - yes

[08:49] <Tiduz> i just want to pre order a fucking ipad apple
[08:49] <Nikashi> I wanna go play Laser tag RL
[08:49] <Noss> naw, that couldn't have happened.
[08:49] <Nikashi> there's  af ew places around
[08:49] <Nikashi> there's one with THREE levels
[08:49] <Noss> I must have been wasted.
[08:49] <Tony_Parker> clp clp chp EX shooooken
[08:49] <Nikashi> and little sniper points
[08:49] <PezRadar> gd Nikashi
[08:49] <PezRadar> in dallas
[08:49] <PezRadar> theres like 5 trillion
[08:49] <PezRadar> laser tag places
[08:49] <PezRadar> haha
[08:49] <Nikashi> yeah
[08:49] <vulva> I just beat a cody
[08:49] <vulva> therefore
[08:49] <vulva> every cody sucks
[08:49] <Nikashi> well we have lots of asians so they just all played DDR and shit
[08:49] <PezRadar> cody is pretty bad
[08:49] <PezRadar> if he can get offensive on u its tough
[08:49] <PezRadar> but if u have an easy way out
[08:50] <Noss> still, pez?
[08:50] <PezRadar> hes pretty meh
[08:50] <Tony_Parker> yea
[08:50] <Nikashi> Tony_Parker : I like her LK Tatsu, HP, ex tatsu, ultra
[08:50] <Nikashi> Sakuras*
[08:50] <Noss> there were some lazer tag places...like 15 years ago.
[08:50] <Himuro> OMFG FUCK VEGA
[08:50] <PezRadar> Noss yea
[08:50] <Nikashi> eh
[08:50] <PezRadar> tons of laser tag places here
[08:50] <Nikashi> I am okay against Vegas now
[08:50] <Noss> most of them either said fuck it or graduated to paintball
[08:50] <PezRadar> many with numerous floors
[08:50] <Nikashi> I used to hate them
[08:50] <Noss> wow
[08:50] <Nikashi> but now I can just punch their face in the air
[08:50] <Tony_Parker> i don't know her U2 stuff too well..still use U1
[08:50] <Noss> I truly am shocked.
[08:50] <Nikashi> or just make them whiff over and over
[08:50] <PezRadar> tony u2 combos into everything
[08:51] <PezRadar> lol
[08:51] <Nikashi> Tony_Parker : you can direct it :D
[08:51] <PezRadar> though u1 does more dmg
[08:51] <Nikashi> as well
[08:51] <Tony_Parker> i know
[08:51] <Nikashi> Yeah but U2 is just like brainless
[08:51] <Tony_Parker> i like the challenge
[08:51] <PezRadar> ex tatsu u2
[08:51] <viakado> so when is the OT opening up again?
[08:51] <PezRadar> freeeeee
[08:51] <Nikashi> U1 is still kinda iffy on the timing from EX tatsu
[08:51] <Nikashi> and differs between characters
[08:51] <PezRadar> ex tatsu dash forward u1
[08:51] <Nikashi> U2 is just MASH THAT SHIT OUT
[08:51] <PezRadar> not too hard
[08:51] <Tony_Parker> i tried linking her super into U1
[08:51] <Nikashi> PezRadar :  I always did it without the dash, hrm
[08:51] <Tony_Parker> wouldn't let me :(
[08:51] <PezRadar> Nikashi
[08:51] <Nikashi> just had slightly harder timing
[08:51] <PezRadar> incorporate a dash
[08:51] <Nikashi> ok
[08:51] <Nikashi> I'll try that
[08:51] * Expy has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[08:52] <PezRadar> its always free then
[08:52] <Nikashi> I never did because you can do it without dashing
[08:52] <PezRadar> just make sure u time it right
[08:52] <PezRadar> sometimes its too fast u miss
[08:52] <PezRadar> its dash pause .2 secs
[08:52] <PezRadar> then ultra
[08:52] <PezRadar> and then u get 1 extra hit
[08:52] <Nikashi> ehh If I can Focus attack, then dash back into demon rage
[08:52] <Nikashi> I can probably handle that
[08:52] <PezRadar> then the method ur using
[08:52] <Rotanibor> nikashi where are my alt costumes
[08:52] <PezRadar> Nikashi
[08:52] <PezRadar> where is my candy

[09:45] <Noss> was there something that needed to happen?
[09:45] <Joekage> money
[09:45] <minty> money
[09:45] * Lovingsteam blows EGM a kiss
[09:45] <minty> dang it joe!
[09:45] <Joekage> lots of money
[09:45] <mrsolo> money
[09:45] <Noss> Texas staying...makes me think...nothing needed to change.
[09:46] <Tony_Parker> Pac10
[09:46] <mrsolo> big 12 got screwed on tv contract
[09:46] <Joekage> lol
[09:46] <onix> missouri said it was leaving, everyone started looking, nebraska left cause it hated texas and thought big12 was ending

[09:46] <minty> solo: did you order yours from amazong
[09:46] <onix> pac 10 offered colorado a spot so it wouldnt get stuck with baylor
[09:46] <onix> then no one else came to pac 10
[09:46] <Noss> haha
[09:46] <mrsolo> minty, nope is it available yet?
[09:46] <minty> it's rastlin!
[09:46] <mrsolo> colorado bolted first
[09:46] <Noss> it just sucks...cause damnit...even when colorado sucked...could be a good year if could beat nebraska
[09:46] <mrsolo> then nebraska
[09:46] <minty> not yet. preorder still
[09:46] <PezRadar> colorado was terrible
[09:47] <PezRadar> Nebraska leaving is kinda sad
[09:47] <PezRadar> but CU was bad
[09:47] <Noss> yup
[09:47] <onix> nebraska looks like the biggest assholes
[09:47] <mrsolo> why? every school for itself
[09:47] <onix> they still mad about the :01 second
[09:47] <mrsolo> imean only reason ut stay is because of more money
[09:48] <PezRadar> the whole big 12 rides on UT
[09:48] <PezRadar> not even OU 
[09:48] <PezRadar> lol
[09:48] <Noss> I honestly could give a fuck less..but colorado playing nebraska every year was a highlight.
[09:48] <onix> big 12 is still together cause theyre about to get the contract reworked, its going to be comparable to big ten money
[09:48] <mrsolo> so pac 10 probably will grab utah
[09:48] <onix> the differences are negligible anyway
[09:48] <PezRadar> CU playing nebraska was not a highlihgt..
[09:48] <onix> like 6 millions a year
[09:48] <PezRadar> Nebraska playing anyone else but CU was more highlights
[09:48] <Noss> for people in colorado it was
[09:48] <Tony_Parker> tuPAC
[09:48] <PezRadar> hell Nebraska vs Missouri was big
[09:48] <Noss> haha pez
[09:48] <onix> is 6 million a year worth ending 100 years of tradition? nebraska looks like assholes
[09:49] <mrsolo> onix, budget crunch
[09:49] <mrsolo> 6 million extra is mighty attractive
[09:49] <onix> thats just the conference take... they make their own money anyway from jerseys and such
[09:49] <onix> for instance... all of big 12 revenue split by 12 was 132 mil a year
[09:49] <onix> texas makes 142 by itself
[09:50] <onix> all in all... splitting conference solely due to split conference money... its kinda pointless
[09:50] <mrsolo> beside money
[09:50] <PezRadar> apple preorders supposedly will start in 1 hr and 10 mins
[09:50] <PezRadar> !
[09:50] <PezRadar> :D
[09:50] <mrsolo> they, meaning all the conferences want to compete with sec
[09:50] <Noss> what has texas holding the thing together...it seems like Texas could make some demands to go to a conference.
[09:51] <mrsolo> well this is just delaying the unavoidable.. another super conference will be create sooner or later
[09:51] <onix> the only real problem was the big 12 tv contracts were staggered, and they were negotiated 4 years behind mega SEC deal... if they waited it would have been the same
[09:51] <PezRadar> texas could make demands 
[09:51] <PezRadar> but they also run the risk of a team not following
[09:51] <PezRadar> either way
[09:51] <PezRadar> id ont even care
[09:51] <onix> < attended UT
[09:52] <mrsolo> i mean sec is just crushing evyerbody else
[09:52] <PezRadar> at least i know that big 12 office is staying in irving
[09:52] <PezRadar> ;p
[09:52] <PezRadar> < graduated from a UT School
[09:52] <onix> i might have a different viewpoint on the matter, but i think i'm not biased
[09:52] <PezRadar> not the Austin branch
[09:52] <Noss> who's in the sec?
[09:52] <onix> but nebraska hated big12 being located in dallas
[09:52] <Noss> just trying to think tv contracts...but I couldn't name an sec team to save my soul.
[09:52] <PezRadar> i actually graduated from a UT School w/ higher requirements the UT Austin (wtf)
[09:52] <PezRadar> =[
[09:52] <onix> hated the conf champ being jerryworld
[09:52] <onix> in dallas
[09:52] <PezRadar> oh well
[09:53] <PezRadar> its gonna be that way
[09:53] <PezRadar> for a while
[09:53] <onix> and thought a couple other things... just hated texas... then "the play"
[09:53] <minty> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=21845064&postcount=7560
[09:53] <PezRadar> either way
[09:53] <minty> wow that looks awful
[09:53] <mrsolo> Noss, the big ones  lsu, florida 
[09:53] <PezRadar> OU + Texas = big 12
[09:53] <minty> even ttob could draw something better than that
[09:53] <onix> they just wanted to leave when they thought it was ending... and left with their middle fingers out
[09:53] <mrsolo> Noss, auburn, tenn, georgia
[09:53] <onix> only difference is it didnt end
[09:53] <vulva> that's terrible

[10:15] <PezRadar> they cancelled schools
[10:15] <PezRadar> cuz of ice

[10:15] <onix> every year i've lived here... theres been like 3 days like that
[10:15] <PezRadar> earlier this year
[10:15] <soakrates> it's like people just can't get over their driving habits
[10:15] <Noss> I can't knock that shit too much...places with humidity have something called frozen rain
[10:15] <PezRadar> that melted by 9am

[10:15] <vulva> I've seen both
[10:15] <Noss> 3 feet of snow is not as evil as frozen rain
[10:15] <onix> one inch of snow that would melt by 11am... everything is closed

[10:16] <PezRadar> like one day it was just like 2-3 inches of ice
[10:16] <PezRadar> on all the roads
[10:16] <onix> there was legit winter in dallas this past year... pretty crazy
[10:16] <PezRadar> *3 years ago
[10:16] <Noss> see, that shit is amazing to me...I've never seen conditions like that

[10:16] <mrsolo> Noss, you don't want to
[10:16] <PezRadar> watch people crash
[10:16] <mrsolo> Noss, trees snapped, powerline down
[10:16] <mrsolo> Noss, cars glide all over
[10:16] <Nikashi> soakrates : You were getting baited a bit, but that might have been because you knew how I used to play
[10:16] <PezRadar> isnt the High Five like the biggest bridge connection in likt he South?
[10:16] <Nikashi> and I was mixing up my focus a bit hehe
[10:17] <onix> could be
[10:17] <onix> dallas loves like 3 mile long ramps suspended 50 feet in air
[10:17] <soakrates> it has more to do with the fact that I don't know what my options are with Cody
[10:17] <PezRadar> yea
[10:17] <PezRadar> The interchange comprises 37 bridges distributed across 5 levels (thus the name "High Five"), with the highest ramps 120 feet (37 m) above ground.[3]  The High Five consists of nearly 60 lane-miles of new roadway and stretches 2.4 miles (3.9 km) north/south and 3.4 miles (5.5 km) east/west.[1]
[10:17] <PezRadar> haha
[10:17] <PezRadar> the high five
[10:17] <PezRadar> is a death dtrap
[10:17] <PezRadar> during ice storms
[10:17] <soakrates> but yeah
[10:17] <PezRadar> 37 Bridges
[10:17] <PezRadar> 5 levels

[10:27] <PezRadar> degrade
[10:27] <Joekage> I'm from Fort Worth
[10:27] <PezRadar> as you continue to denton
[10:27] <Joekage> only in Denton for school
[10:28] <PezRadar> I also hate the HEB area

[10:29] <PezRadar> university park
[10:29] <PezRadar> ... las colinas
[10:29] <onix> dallas is basically a bunch of surrounding areas that are populated quickly, then 20 years later they become the ghetto
[10:29] <PezRadar> that about wraps it up for suburbs that are good
[10:29] <soakrates> HAIL SATAN

[10:32] <PezRadar> but..
[10:32] <PezRadar> past 75
[10:32] <onix> 75 is the dividing line for ghetto

[10:33] <PezRadar> south of plano
[10:33] <PezRadar> garland is east of it
[10:33] <PezRadar> richardson is kinda ghetto
[10:33] <PezRadar> north richardson isnt bad
[10:33] <PezRadar> by the telecom sector
[10:33] <onix> i took a real estate course in school... and it talked about strange mental dividing lines like that

[10:36] <PezRadar> or maybe a midway
[10:36] <onix> but unless you have 5 million dollars and live in preston hollow or highland park... dallas is developed further and further north
[10:36] <PezRadar> i-635/midway

[10:43] <PezRadar> that lives off worthington and mckinney
[10:43] <PezRadar> in those town homes
[10:43] <mrsolo> PezRadar, 3.40 here
[10:43] <PezRadar> mrsolo - yea its still trucks/suvs down here
[10:43] <onix> because we were spending too much while playing 30 dollars worth of big buck
[10:43] <PezRadar> but i drive a mazdaspeed3 so i gotta fill on premium
[10:43] <onix> we would spend hours on that game
[10:43] <PezRadar> and my previous car a MINI Cooper S used premium too
[10:43] <onix> so i stole like 40 metal beer tubs
[10:44] <onix> and we would fill it with miller late and ice from our fridge
[10:44] <PezRadar> i like state/allen for a food beer place in uptown
[10:44] <PezRadar> its quick and good and has tvs etc
[10:44] <PezRadar> i like.. gingerman for just beer in uptown
[10:44] <onix> then just walk into the bar from the back entrance with 6 beers and goto big buck
[10:44] <PezRadar> but .. i have tons of options in addison
[10:44] <mrsolo> PezRadar, man surround by big suvs..don't you feel unsafe?
[10:44] <PezRadar> mrsolo not really

[10:46] <PezRadar> Addison <3
[10:46] <Rotanibor> i asked those people and they admited it was a trap
[10:46] <PezRadar> Ive gone to Shops at Legacy
[10:46] <PezRadar> a few times
[10:46] <PezRadar> They have a fox sports grill
[10:46] <PezRadar> and gingerman
[10:46] <onix> i was driving in gridlock singing along to music jamming out and ran into a giant trailer
[10:46] <PezRadar> and ringos pub

[10:46] <PezRadar> once in high school
[10:46] <PezRadar> i rear ended a friend
[10:47] <PezRadar> at legacy/tollway in plano
[10:47] <PezRadar> before shops of legacy existed
[10:47] <PezRadar> it was all just farm land
[10:47] <onix> i also got hit by a blue barrel that was bouncing up and down on the highway
[10:47] <PezRadar> then... i got rear ended in my MINI
[10:47] <PezRadar> by a Ford Excursion

[10:47] <PezRadar> south of Addison

[10:47] <mrsolo> PezRadar, wow
[10:47] <PezRadar> i only had my MINI for 3 months too
[10:47] <PezRadar> then the guy showed me his insurance card
[10:47] <mrsolo> ford excursion isn't that the biggest?
[10:47] <PezRadar> i got all hsi info
[10:48] <PezRadar> yes mrsolo
[10:48] <PezRadar> then i called his insurance
[10:48] <mrsolo> mini totaled?
[10:48] <PezRadar> and he hadnt paid for the past few months
[10:48] <PezRadar> so his insurance card was not legit
[10:48] <PezRadar> had to pay deductibel for uninsured
[10:48] <PezRadar> Nah
[10:48] <PezRadar> I only had 1,200 in dmg
[10:48] <PezRadar> MINI's are hella strong yo
[10:48] <PezRadar> BMW ! :D
[10:48] <PezRadar> BMW made that is :)
[10:48] <mrsolo> right
[10:48] <mrsolo> 3400 lbs
[10:48] <mrsolo> vs what? 4500?
[10:49] <Joekage> I'm cool with my altima
[10:49] <PezRadar> dunno
[10:49] <PezRadar> i was at a red
[10:49] <Joekage> I got all the way to austin and back on one tank of gas
[10:49] <PezRadar> the light had turned green
[10:49] <PezRadar> i was in the process of shifting into 1st
[10:49] <PezRadar> and he slammed into me
[10:49] <mrsolo> i tried out cooper s.. whole lot of fun
[10:49] <PezRadar> at like 25-30 mph?
[10:49] <PezRadar> he thought i was already moving
[10:49] <PezRadar> cuz the light was green
[10:49] <PezRadar> yet i was at the red for 20 seconds
[10:49] <PezRadar> :\
[10:50] <onix> http://uploads.mibbit.com/8FabFB.jpg 
[10:50] <mrsolo> on cell phone, not paying attention etc etc
[10:50] <PezRadar> lol
[10:50] <PezRadar> yea
[10:50] <PezRadar> probably
[10:50] <onix> the most massive overly massive american car
[10:50] <PezRadar> lol onix
[10:50] <PezRadar> But yea im in a 2010 MazdaSpeed3 now
[10:50] <PezRadar> Its faster..
[10:50] <PezRadar> but ... my next car
[10:51] <PezRadar> may be another MINI
[10:51] <mrsolo> faster but is it more fun?
[10:51] <mrsolo> didn't try out speed3
[10:51] <Joekage> my next car is a 2013 Infiniti G37
[10:51] <PezRadar> mrsolo its fun
[10:51] <mrsolo> i know cooper s isn't as good as gti 
[10:51] <Joekage> I already have the down payment for it, I'm gonna get it as a graduation gift to myself
[10:51] <PezRadar> i disagree
[10:51] <PezRadar> I hate how the GTI handles compared to the MINI
[10:52] <PezRadar> GTI is faster in a straight line
[10:52] <mrsolo> gti deliver is smoother
[10:52] <PezRadar> but the MINI is a fucking go kart
[10:52] <mrsolo> yes
[10:52] <PezRadar> and i love it for that
[10:52] <PezRadar> but my next MINI
[10:52] <onix> i always drive jeeps
[10:52] <PezRadar> will be the new roadster
[10:52] <PezRadar> http://www.thetorquereport.com/mini_roadster_concept_12.jpg
[10:52] <mrsolo> mini feels sluggish at start
[10:52] <PezRadar> comes out next year
[10:52] <mrsolo> Joekage, i tried out g37 too..not bad
[10:52] <Joekage> yeah
[10:52] <PezRadar> onix
[10:52] <PezRadar> ive always wanted a jeep wrangler
[10:52] <Joekage> I test drove one not too long ago
[10:52] <PezRadar> dont think i can get over the gas mileage though
[10:53] <PezRadar> haha
[10:53] <onix> i drive cherokees
[10:53] <Joekage> soon as I hit the gas I realized it was my dream car
[10:53] <onix> but 4 dour wrangler... its interesting
[10:53] <PezRadar> But yea.. I want a MINI Roadster, or I will get a BMW 135i.
[10:53] <PezRadar> Ill decide sooner or later
[10:53] <mrsolo> Joekage, hmm oh? hmm
[10:53] <mrsolo> Joekage, it is faster but i think cooper s or gti is more fun
[10:54] <onix> i never liked wranglers but the 4dr intrigued me and i know two people that had them as rentals like for biz trips and loved it
[10:54] <onix> but they are horrible for gas.
[10:54] <Joekage> Could be, I don't know I liked the car more for the overall feel. From the interior to the handling it was perfect
[10:54] <PezRadar> man
[10:54] <PezRadar> g37 is only as fast as my mazda
[10:54] <PezRadar> :\
[10:54] <PezRadar> failz.
[10:54] <PezRadar> <3
[10:54] <onix> if i won the lottery or something... i want the fisker karma
[10:54] <mrsolo> PezRadar, well that's because your mazada is zoom zoom
[10:55] <PezRadar> lol
[10:55] <mrsolo> really, not whole lot of car is that fast
[10:55] <mrsolo> well mustang is faster :-)
[10:56] <onix> http://uploads.mibbit.com/2LRezs.jpg 
[10:56] <PezRadar> 135i 0-60 is 4.7 seconds
[10:56] <PezRadar> <3 <3 <3 <3
[10:56] <onix> thats a hybrid
[10:57] <PezRadar> im guessing the mini roadster
[10:57] <PezRadar> will be low 6's
[10:57] <PezRadar> since the regular cooper S is mid 6.0's
[10:57] <mrsolo> PezRadar, mustang gt is faster :-)
[10:57] <PezRadar> why would i drive a mustang gt?
[10:57] <PezRadar> every other car on the road
[10:57] <PezRadar> is a mustang gt
[10:57] <mrsolo> keep hearing that
[10:57] <mrsolo> is it really?
[10:57] <PezRadar> yea

[11:03] <PezRadar> we need to meet!
[11:03] <PezRadar> :P
[11:03] <onix> same school system
[11:03] <mrsolo> so young
[11:03] <PezRadar> wow
[11:03] <PezRadar> white iphones
[11:03] <PezRadar> not available for preorder
[11:04] <PezRadar> fuck that
[11:04] <PezRadar> guess im getting black
[11:04] <onix> yea i read that
[11:04] <onix> probably be a few months or so?
[11:04] <PezRadar> no clue
[11:04] <PezRadar> but man i wanted white
[11:04] <PezRadar> but since its not gonna be available
[11:04] <PezRadar> i guess ill get black
[11:04] <onix> read it on engadget or something
[11:04] <PezRadar> well that was AT&T 
[11:04] <PezRadar> apple is the same
[11:05] <mrsolo> PezRadar, bmw 1..isn't that smaller than mini cooper?
[11:06] <PezRadar> no
[11:06] <onix> http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/14/white-iphone-4-likely-not-available-at-launch?icid=sphere_blogsmith_inpage_engadget
[11:06] <onix> it says white isnt until later this summer
[11:06] <PezRadar> AT&T and apple arent the same 
[11:06] <PezRadar> so people were holding out hope
[11:06] <PezRadar> but unfortunately it counts for both
[11:07] <onix> i think apple gets a kick out of holding back something for sick months
[11:07] <onix> so gadget freaks will literally buy something, the day it comes out, and another 6 months later
[11:07] <onix> get slight update or difff color
[11:07] <PezRadar> their store
[11:07] <PezRadar> is dying on m

[11:10] <PezRadar> lol
[11:10] <PezRadar> he plays like half the cast
[11:11] <Joekage> I can play most but yeah
[11:11] <Joekage> I'm not participating if it's random select
[11:12] <Joekage> online tournaments dont really show your skill but making it random select it pretty much worse in that regard
[11:12] <Joekage> makes it*

[11:13] <PezRadar> when they come out 
[11:13] <PezRadar> like that geom mod inside guile guy
[11:14] <Joekage> well yeah, but online and offline are two completely different games
[11:14] <soakrates> do they do really wel at tourneys though?
[11:14] <PezRadar> geom mod inside did
[11:15] <PezRadar> he won some mlg event
[11:15] <soakrates> I mean even guys like Wolfkrone and eva01 who play online a LOT
[11:15] <PezRadar> but didnt get paid cuz hew as out of country
[11:15] <Joekage> I'm sure he plays offline though
[11:15] <soakrates> still play offline quite a bit
[11:15] <PezRadar> yea but to say online shows nothing
[11:15] <PezRadar> yet the people that play offline
[11:15] <PezRadar> still dominate online
[11:15] <PezRadar> kills that point
[11:15] <mrsolo> PezRadar, man we don't get this in the states http://www.thedieseldriver.com/2010/06/driving-the-120d-the-road-to-leipzig/
[11:15] * KTallguy has quit IRC (Quit: I love you all.)
[11:15] <PezRadar> if online was really that diff then it would jack their game that they wouldnt play to the best on the leaderboards
[11:15] <PezRadar> like what we see
[11:15] <Joekage> well of course, yeah, it shows your skill but this game is built on reactions and reaction time online compared to offline is horrible
[11:16] <soakrates> well to be fair
[11:16] <PezRadar> but those people who play offline still top the charts
[11:16] <Joekage> Like deep uppercuts are almost impossible online
[11:16] <soakrates> in Europe and Jaan, internet connections are way better
[11:16] <soakrates> *Japan
[11:16] <PezRadar> mrsolo

[11:16] <mrsolo> utility #1!
[11:17] <Joekage> It's not to say that they can't win, just that they have to play a different style of play as in way more cautious because of lag and the reversals in this game
[11:17] <soakrates> so online play over there is probably a lot closer to offline than it is hear

[12:18] <Mac10x> An American armed with a pistol and a 40-inch sword was detained in northern Pakistan and told investigators he was on a solo mission to kill Osama bin Laden, a police officer said Tuesday.
[12:18] <Mac10x> The man was identified as 52-year-old Californian construction worker Gary Brooks Faulkner,
[12:19] <Mac10x> When asked why he thought he had a chance of tracing bin Laden, Faulkner replied, "God is with me, and I am confident I will be successful in killing him," said Khan.

[12:32] <Hyoushi> ah man

[12:32] <thatbox> no contest

[12:33] <thatbox> his calf, rather

[12:34] <PezRadar> king of dives
[12:34] <thatbox> of course
[12:34] <Hyoushi> lol @ Forza Kinect
[12:34] * BJ has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[12:35] <Tre`Kage> wowwwwww
[12:35] <itsgreen> to me Forza Kinect sounded like, we need some thing hardcore, but we don't have anything. Patch up this demo...
[12:35] <Hyoushi> http://twitpic.com/1wy2eh/full
[12:35] <Hyoushi> hahahha
[12:35] <HadesGigas> oh boy, namco is making a Mario Party, except with Pac-Man, again
[12:35] <Hyoushi> in the forza kinect demo
[12:36] <Hyoushi> I loved how there was no explanation how you accelerate/brake
[12:36] <Hyoushi> probably automatic
[12:36] <Hyoushi> huahua
[12:36] * BossG has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[12:36] <HadesGigas> lean forward/backward probably, heh
[12:36] * BossG has joined #ga
[12:36] <Hyoushi> nah, that makes you move in the cockpit like with trackir
[12:36] <HadesGigas> or make "vroom" noises
[12:36] * BJ has joined #ga
[12:37] <itsgreen> It wont be hard for Sony to impress us at E3 with some hardcore things.... 
[12:37] <HadesGigas> sony already showed that socom game
[12:37] <HadesGigas> that pretty much trumps anything kinect has shown so far 
[12:38] <itsgreen> Kinect isn't for us, that is no secret, to judge fairly you have to set aside your hardcore mind :)
[12:38] <itsgreen> I can see my 3 year old niece play with that tiger and have a great time
[12:38] * mac has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[12:38] <HadesGigas> she can also play with sony's eyepet
[12:38] <BossG> hehe, you gotta watch grandma...what she thinks of it
[12:39] <itsgreen> And where else do you have Dance Hero, or whatever that thing was
[12:39] <itsgreen> * exclusive to xbox *
[12:39] <HadesGigas> though i will give kinect credit for one thing, those full body dance games will be a huge hit
[12:39] <itsgreen> :P
[12:39] <HadesGigas> just dance and we cheer were big on wii and that was just hand motion stuff
[12:40] <itsgreen> the guy showing that should have made an 'im white' joke
[12:40] <BossG> lol, the gifs from that were hilarious
[12:40] <HadesGigas> Kinect Adventures looked awful, i'd think even casual wouldn't be interested in that one
[12:40] <itsgreen> kind of avoided Gaf itself, no reason to get 500s :)
[12:40] <BossG> he did get better as time went on, but still really stiff
[12:41] <EviLore> everything looks awful
[12:41] <itsgreen> fanboy!
[12:41] <HadesGigas> well i mean awful as casual games
[12:41] <EviLore> pc gaming save me
[12:41] <Hyoushi> this was awesome
[12:41] <Hyoushi> http://i49.tinypic.com/2vl7gq9.gif
[12:41] <BossG> I have no sympathy for douchebag gamers....
[12:41] <HadesGigas> Rare Sports looked like a competant ripoff
[12:41] <itsgreen> yeah even the logo
[12:42] <itsgreen> btw that gif is awesome
[12:42] <HadesGigas> the fitness games looked far beyond what wii fit does
[12:42] <BossG> there's more shooters than bullets...then you get a game from japan that has swords...hehe...whatever
[12:42] <soakrates> hooray
[12:42] <soakrates> they didn't nerf chickenwing
[12:42] <itsgreen> yeah but rising isnt Kinect right?
[12:42] <Hyoushi> yes
[12:42] <Hyoushi> it is
[12:42] <itsgreen> oh.
[12:42] <syllogism> doubt it
[12:42] <Hyoushi> o rlt
[12:42] <Hyoushi> rly
[12:42] <Hyoushi> thought it was
[12:42] <syllogism> we saw the input lag
[12:43] <syllogism> and it's a multiplatform game
[12:43] <itsgreen> hmmm now I dont remember
[12:43] <syllogism> maybe you can do some stuff with Kinect
[12:43] <HadesGigas> looked like the main character was moving as if he were controlled, can't be kinect
[12:43] <HadesGigas> not on rails enough
[12:43] <itsgreen> Anyhow that fitness stuff, also EA Active looked like somethign I might enjoy...
[12:44] <itsgreen> just not 200$ enjoy
[12:45] <PezRadar> well apple
[12:45] <PezRadar> weve gone from 
[12:45] <PezRadar> Halfway through checkout

[12:46] <PezRadar> to.. OOPS WE DONT HAVE A STORE error messages
[12:46] <PezRadar> can we move forward here.. as opposed to backwards?
[12:46] <Hyoushi> the slowdown cut might be done with kinect

[12:49] <phil> I didn't watch Ubi (just read a blog)     did they really copy the vitality sensor?
[12:49] <Joekage> lol
[12:49] <EviLore> seriously though just give me rock band 3 with the real guitar
[12:49] <EviLore> that'll probably be 1000 hours played
[12:50] * mrsolo has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[12:50] * Hyoushi has quit IRC (Quit: WORLD PEACE PUT UP CLUB)
[12:50] <EviLore> so at least there's that
[12:50] <Joekage> I spent 1200 hours on Vanilla SFIV, most ever on a game. I plan to spend just as much time on Golden Sun DS

[12:50] <Joekage> DONT LET ME DOWN
[12:50] <Tre`Kage> magic tomorrow, conveniently after the nintendo conference
[12:50] <Tre`Kage> just in time to wash the non-game taste out of your mouth
[12:51] <Joekage> lol
[12:51] <EviLore> today
[12:51] <Tre`Kage> right
[12:51] <Tre`Kage> today
[12:51] <Tre`Kage> tonight
[12:51] <EviLore> in 6 hours...

[12:52] <EviLore> ah yes i didn't catch most of the ubi conference, will watch now
[12:52] <RagnarokX> that Ubisoft conference was something else
[12:52] <RagnarokX> eh, you might not want to :P\

[12:53] <PezRadar> T_T
[12:54] <Joekage> lol
[12:54] <FirewalkR> Just read about activision's event. was it good at all? sounded like a star-studded event with a trailer here and there
[12:54] <FirewalkR> *yawns*
[12:55] <RagnarokX> couldn't be worse than the MS and Ubisoft events
[12:55] <Joekage> a heart monitor...
[12:55] <Joekage> seriously?
[12:55] <sprsk> wow
[12:55] <Tre`Kage> i dunno RagnarokX
[12:55] <Tre`Kage> until ubisoft
[12:55] <sprsk> iphone preorder total fucking failure
[12:55] <Tre`Kage> I didn't think it could be worse than MS
[12:55] <Tre`Kage> these are multimillion/billion dollar companies
[12:55] <Tre`Kage> don't underestimate their ability to fuck up
[12:55] <HadesGigas> Ubisoft had Rayman though, better than anything MS did
[12:56] <Tre`Kage> true
[12:56] <Joekage> How can this even be considered.. a game
[12:56] <HadesGigas> Joe, have you seen their lasertag "game"?
[12:56] <Joekage> no
[12:56] <soakrates> so glad chickenwing is intact
[12:56] <HadesGigas> that heartmonitor is a hardcore video game compared to it
[12:56] <Joekage> is it worse than this?
[12:56] <HadesGigas> it's a toy
[12:56] <soakrates> I was fearing the worst
[12:56] <Joekage> wow
[12:56] <RagnarokX> I dunno, I thought the Shaun White segment was the worst
[12:56] <Joekage> chickenwing feels the same
[12:57] <HadesGigas> Shaun White segment was nowhere near the worst
[12:57] <soakrates> it is
[12:57] <Joekage> i'm sure they just adjusted the hitboxes
[12:57] <sprsk> shaun white game actually looked decent
[12:57] <HadesGigas> game looked alright in concept, just bad graphics
[12:57] <soakrates> I can tell because you can still combo into it from cl.mp
[12:57] <soakrates> on Juri, Rose, etc.
[12:57] <Joekage> ah
[12:57] <HadesGigas> http://www.gametrailers.com/video/e3-2010-battle-tag/101408
[12:57] <RagnarokX> Well, I left to go cook dinner in the middle of the battle tag segment
[12:58] <Joekage> did he really just say this monitor would give your immune system a boost and lower blood pressure
[12:58] <Joekage> wow
[12:58] <RagnarokX> when I came back, people were dancing to Beat It for no reason
[12:58] <Joekage> wtf
[12:58] <Joekage> are you serious
[12:58] <RagnarokX> yeah
[12:58] <RagnarokX> no game
[12:58] <RagnarokX> they just danced
[12:59] * SS4Gogita has joined #ga
[12:59] <RagnarokX> for the whole song
[12:59] <Joekage> haha
[12:59] <Joekage> this laser tag thing
[12:59] <Joekage> looking at the crowd
[12:59] <Joekage> everyone is like what the fuck
[12:59] <PezRadar> ok
[12:59] <PezRadar> sleeping for an hr..
[12:59] <PezRadar> then waking up
[12:59] <PezRadar> and trying again
[13:00] <PezRadar> fuck you apple
[13:00] <PezRadar> fuck you at&t
[13:00] <RagnarokX> that guy is so winded after battle tagging
[13:00] <PezRadar> fuck you world
[13:00] * Newduck has joined #ga
[13:00] <Joekage> haha he can hardly talk
[13:00] <EviLore> Community guy is so not funny
[13:01] <RagnarokX> "I am the Bishop of Battle"
[13:01] <HadesGigas> lol well it's not like he was adlibbing, horrible ubijokes
[13:01] <HadesGigas> you can see his teleprompter during that battle tag shit
[13:01] <Joekage> wasn't this already made before?
[13:01] <RagnarokX> anyone remember Bishop of Battle?
[13:01] <Joekage> just kinda less techy?
[13:01] <Joekage> nerf or somebody did this before
[13:02] <RagnarokX> it was a short movie where Emelio Estevez is a arcade hotshot who fights and evil arcade cabinet
[13:02] <HadesGigas> it said something like "is everyone seeing this or an i having a stroke", and he didn't bother saying that, lol
[13:02] * SS4Gogita has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[13:03] * SS4Gogita has joined #ga
[13:03] <Joekage> wow
[13:03] <Joekage> that was the most horrible demonstration of a game
[13:03] <Joekage> that looked like it had no ounce of fun in it
[13:03] <PezRadar> lmfao
[13:03] <PezRadar> apple store back down
[13:03] <PezRadar> good lord
[13:04] <PezRadar> http://img.skitch.com/20100615-11w74xatdcht8t158bdk6hbd3y.jpg
[13:04] <PezRadar> haha
[13:04] <FirewalkR> is the crysis 2 trailer (the one shown in 3d at the event) online anywhere in good quality?
[13:05] <Joekage> ok yeah
[13:05] <Joekage> that was pretty damn bad
[13:05] <EviLore> video game websites do occasionally do things besides accept bribes and give hyped games 10/10
[13:05] <EviLore> so yes, the crysis 2 video will be on all the major sites
[13:05] <Tre`Kage> I still can't believe the end of the MS conference
[13:05] <HadesGigas> ;p; deca sports kinect http://www.gametrailers.com/video/e3-2010-deca-sports/101394

[13:06] <Joekage> I really lol'd at the skittles kinectimals thing
[13:06] <Tre`Kage> random MJ dance number
[13:06] <EviLore> this shaun white skateboarding at the ubi conference looks pretty jank
[13:06] <Tre`Kage> not as bad as HEY PLEASE HYPE OUR SHIT, FREE 360s FOR JOO
[13:06] <HadesGigas> it's no tony hawk ride!
[13:06] <Rotanibor> i would have sit through that terrible shit
[13:06] <EviLore> EA Skate has way better mechanics going by ubi's vid
[13:06] <Rotanibor> for a free 360
[13:06] <RagnarokX> lol wow
[13:06] <soakrates> you guy are playing SS4 now? lol
[13:06] <Rotanibor> i was pissed when i sat through sony's shitty conference a couple years ago
[13:06] <RagnarokX> I thought that teleprompter thing was a photoshop
[13:07] <Tre`Kage> yeah soak
[13:07] <RagnarokX> but it actually says that
[13:07] <RagnarokX> rofl
[13:07] <Rotanibor> and they just rambled about home for an hour and a half
[13:07] <soakrates> btw Rota, CW is intact
[13:07] <soakrates> *dance*
[13:07] <Rotanibor> and they didn't bribe me or anything in the end
[13:07] <Rotanibor> i wanted a free psp 
[13:07] <soakrates> the nightmare continues
[13:07] <Joekage> god damn, kinect looks so horrible
[13:07] <Joekage> and for 150?
[13:07] <Joekage> hell no
[13:08] <FirewalkR> EviLore, i know it'll be online, i just wanted to feast my eyes on it right now :)
[13:08] <Joekage> wow paintball
[13:08] <Joekage> lmao
[13:08] <Rotanibor> hey
[13:08] <HadesGigas> http://www.gametrailers.com/video/e3-2010-zumba-fitness/101387 it's a fitness game AND a dance game
[13:08] <HadesGigas> i hope it has sports minigames
[13:08] <Rotanibor> kinect isn't completely useless
[13:08] <Rotanibor> like, have you ever wondered what the bottom of an avatar's foot looks like?
[13:08] <Joekage> lmao
[13:08] <soakrates> I still want to know how all these randoms got in here
[13:09] <soakrates> like this ryaxnb cat
[13:09] <soakrates> who the fuck is that?
[13:09] <Rotanibor> whoop there it is
[13:09] <soakrates> tag team
[13:09] <soakrates> back again
[13:09] <Joekage> the spanish music caught me off guard
[13:10] <RagnarokX> but nothing will beat the Kinectimals demo
[13:10] <RagnarokX> skittles is in the bag
[13:10] <Joekage> skittles is a classic
[13:11] <RagnarokX> It's like this has become a schadenfreude convention
[13:12] <EviLore> what the fuck is going on in this ubisoft conference
[13:12] <EviLore> laser tag?
[13:12] * SS4Gogita has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[13:12] * SS4Gogita has joined #ga
[13:12] <RagnarokX> lol EviLore, I told you it was bad
[13:12] <HadesGigas> its what gamers ahve been waiting for
[13:12] <soakrates> lulz motion controls
[13:12] * mac has joined #ga
[13:13] <Rotanibor> hahaha just watching it now evilore?
[13:13] <Rotanibor> it gets progressively worse from that point on
[13:13] <Rotanibor> its scary
[13:13] <RagnarokX> I should watch the parts I missed
[13:13] <HadesGigas> no, battle tag is definitely low point
[13:13] <RagnarokX> what happened after the laser tag?
[13:13] <soakrates> what's this laser tag shit
[13:13] <HadesGigas> breathing game, fitness game
[13:13] <soakrates> was that the ubi soft conference?
[13:13] <HadesGigas> micheal jackson dance off
[13:13] <RagnarokX> I saw the dancing part
[13:14] <Rotanibor> missed it soak?
[13:14] <Rotanibor> yeah ubi is selling laser tag
[13:15] <soakrates> yeah
[13:15] <EviLore> this laser tag creator guy is still catching his breath from jogging 30 feet
[13:15] <Rotanibor> hahah that dude catching his breath was hilarious
[13:15] <Rotanibor> they treat laser tag like it is an all new invention
[13:15] <mac> great moses.  http://cdn.wwtdd.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/l187496_005-450x691.jpg
[13:15] <mac> That's better than 10 crotch pics of miley cyrus

[13:16] <RagnarokX> I love that this isn't a photoshop: http://i45.tinypic.com/29ohezk.jpg
[13:17] <RagnarokX> Rotanibor, I like the concept of having ammo pickups, but it looks so horribly executed
[13:17] <Joekage> http://www.gametrailers.com/video/e3-09-kinect/50184
[13:17] <EviLore> WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT
[13:17] <Joekage> lmao wtf

[13:22] <EviLore> ....oh look, more WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT
[13:22] <Joekage> skittles!
[13:22] <RagnarokX> good boy skittles
[13:22] <RagnarokX> I should make a gif where a tiger leaps out and attacks
[13:23] <Joekage> that would be good
[13:24] <RagnarokX> that wrestling gif is already too good
[13:25] <EviLore> YOU CAN PLUG THE INNERGY SENSOR INTO ANY COMPUTER WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IT MEANS YOU CAN LEVEL UP ANYWHERE YOU WANT
[13:26] <EviLore> sorry, batshit red hair man, I'm not going to level up my breathing pattern 
[13:26] <mac> what is this breathing pattern?
[13:26] <mac> Is that part of the lazer tag?
[13:26] <RagnarokX> Level up breathing pattern? So Ubisoft is turning the world into GTA: San Andreas?
[13:27] <EviLore> yes
[13:27] <Joekage> it also lowers your blood pressure
[13:27] <Joekage> no more honey nut cheerios
[13:27] <EviLore> mac: it's a "game" where you attune your breathing to a line on a screen and the more you do it the more you LEVEL UP
[13:27] <Joekage> and exercise
[13:27] <mac> I love breathing!
[13:27] <Kabouter> <3 San Andreas
[13:27] <RagnarokX> best GTA game
[13:28] <Kabouter> Yes
[13:28] <RagnarokX> even though it falls apart at the end
[13:28] <Kabouter> Has anyone announced/shown anything even remotely interesting yet this E3?
[13:28] <EviLore> nope.
[13:28] <Kabouter> Still not huh? Damn.
[13:28] <RagnarokX> tomorrow should be good, though
[13:28] <Kabouter> All I've seen so far was the first half hour of the whole MS conference thing
[13:28] <Kabouter> What a trainwreck
[13:28] <RagnarokX> err, today
[13:28] <Kabouter> CoD: Black Ops is lame as fuck
[13:28] <Kabouter> Halo Reach is lame as fuck
[13:29] <EviLore> crysis 2 looks consolized, shitty cod/gears/halo sequels of shittiness, horrible waggle
[13:29] <EviLore> that's all so far
[13:29] <Kabouter> Gears of War 3 is lame as fuck
[13:29] <Kabouter> Crysis 2 is lame as fuck
[13:29] <Kabouter> Metal Gear Solid Rising is lame as fuck
[13:29] <Kabouter> And that's all I saw
[13:29] <RagnarokX> There was Dead Space 2, but that looked less interesting than the first game
[13:29] <EviLore> dead space 2 looks exactly like dead space 1, but in a different setting
[13:29] <RagnarokX> Dead Space set in the Church of Scientology fighting zombie babies
[13:29] <EviLore> uninteresting
[13:29] <Kabouter> The Sims 3: Ambitions the most interesting 2010 title of EA confirmed.
[13:30] <Kabouter> (Without kidding, it actually is pretty good)
[13:30] <EviLore> mirror's edge 2 would've been a good reveal, but nope
[13:30] <Kabouter> Yeah, was hoping for that EviLore
[13:30] <Kabouter> <3 ME
[13:30] <Kabouter> Best platformer ever
[13:30] <RagnarokX> NFS Hot Pursuit showing the most boring looking mode in a racing game ever
[13:31] <EviLore> I feel like I'm watching the worst infomercial of all time with this innergy breathing crap at the ubisoft conference
[13:31] <EviLore> wow
[13:31] * Brannon has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[13:31] <Joekage> yeah it's pretty bad
[13:31] <Joekage> they just have nintendo a cop out
[13:31] <Joekage> Oh hey at least it's better than that Ubisoft shit
[13:32] <RagnarokX> They should have gotten that guy that sells those "Natural Cures They Don't Want You To Know About" books
[13:32] * Brannon has joined #ga
[13:32] <Kabouter> I think we've come to the point where it really could not be more obvious that the games convention is superior in every way to E3
[13:32] <Kabouter> Better announcements, no bullshit downtimes
[13:32] <RagnarokX> you know, the guy that says that eating cyanide will cure cancer
[13:32] <Kabouter> Oh, and ACTUAL GAMES
[13:32] <RagnarokX> "Eating avacado pits cures cancer!" avacado pits contain cyanide
[13:33] <EviLore> poison indeed cures cancer
[13:33] <mac> a little does
[13:33] <EviLore> also cures you of living
[13:33] <mac> Its proven by holistic medicine
[13:33] <mac> Water has memory
[13:33] <EviLore> :D
[13:34] <EviLore> holy fuck ubisoft what are you doing
[13:34] <RagnarokX> well
[13:34] <RagnarokX> all in all
[13:34] <RagnarokX> it was better than their show last year
[13:34] <RagnarokX> at least they showed SOMETHING
[13:35] <RagnarokX> :P
[13:35] <RagnarokX> does the video you are watching have the strange trailer transition glitches, EviLore?
[13:36] <RagnarokX> unless they did that on purpose
[13:36] * SS4Gogita has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[13:36] <RagnarokX> it was like the trailers were superimposed on the stage
[13:37] <Joekage> did ubisoft announce any real games besides rayman 2d?
[13:37] <EviLore> dunno, I can barely stand watching this so I'm multitasking
[13:37] <Kabouter> How many real franchises does Ubi even have Joekage?
[13:37] <Kabouter> It's too early for the announcement of a new Anno or Settlers game
[13:38] <Joekage> ...true
[13:38] <Kabouter> And Assassin's Creed Brotherhood was already announced
[13:38] <phil> another 2d game, three -mania games
[13:38] <Kabouter> And Assassin's Creed 3 is too early
[13:38] <Kabouter> So....
[13:38] <RagnarokX> Does Rez 2 count?
[13:38] <Kabouter> No
[13:38] <Joekage> damn
[13:38] <Joekage> they're fucked this year
[13:38] <RagnarokX> it's Kinect exclusive
[13:38] <RagnarokX> so that sucks
[13:38] <phil> no
[13:38] <Kabouter> Then DEFINITELY doesn't count
[13:38] <phil> that rez type game is also on move
[13:38] <RagnarokX> it is?
[13:39] <RagnarokX> so then it double sucks?
[13:39] <Joekage> honestly
[13:39] <Joekage> to top everything so gar
[13:39] <Joekage> far*
[13:39] <EviLore> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=21852181&postcount=566
[13:39] <Joekage> all sony has to do is announce a cheaper ps3
[13:39] <RagnarokX> no
[13:39] <RagnarokX> all sony has to do
[13:39] <RagnarokX> is come on stage, and thank everyone for coming
[13:39] <RagnarokX> and then leave
[13:39] <phil> say what you want. kinect is pretty cool
[13:40] <Joekage> Kinect has potential to be cool
[13:40] <Joekage> but the software they showed was eh
[13:40] <phil> no it already is. the games are not :)
[13:40] * Newduck has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[13:40] * Expy has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[13:40] <Joekage> But the games make the machine, only thing I see remotely useful is the video chat thing
[13:41] <RagnarokX> the problem with Kinect is that unlike Nintendo, the people that made it do not understand the market for it at all. Just look at that launch lineup
[13:42] <RagnarokX> it's a Diskinect
[13:42] <Narayan> Holy shit. My root canal just went from no pain to FULL FUCKING FORCE.
[13:42] <mac> get your pills!
[13:42] <RagnarokX> you got a root canal at 3 in the morning?
[13:42] <Narayan> Yeah. No kidding.
[13:42] <Narayan> No. I got it yesterday.
[13:43] * Newduck has joined #ga
[13:43] <Narayan> I took some Tylenol - and I was sleeping.
[13:43] <Narayan> It didn't hurt for, like, 11 hours.
[13:43] <RagnarokX> so were you watching the conferences yesterday high?
[13:44] <Joekage> I'm not even gonna lie though
[13:44] <Narayan> No. I wasn't given a prescription.
[13:44] <Joekage> Rayman 2d looks amazing
[13:44] <Narayan> Just Tylenol.
[13:44] <Narayan> I have a pretty high resistance to pain
[13:44] * SS4Gogita has joined #ga
[13:46] <Joekage> LMAO
[13:46] <Joekage> watching the Beat it dance thing
[13:46] * mack has joined #ga
[13:46] * Expy has joined #ga
[13:46] <mack> You better be on the phone at 8 am calling for pills
[13:47] <Narayan> Was I supposed to get pills or something?
[13:47] <Narayan> I mean... the pain isn't THAT bad.
[13:47] <Narayan> Bad enough for me to take Tylenol.
[13:47] <mack> oooh, and mention how much tylenol you've already taken.  They might give you the stuff without tylenol already in it
[13:47] <mack> I had assumed root canals were painfull
[13:47] * mac has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[13:48] <Joekage> they are
[13:48] <Narayan> I've only taken four Tylenol in the past 15 hours.
[13:48] <Narayan> It's not THAT bad.
[13:48] <Joekage> it's not that bad though
[13:48] <Narayan> I could just smoke some weed.
[13:48] <Joekage> yep
[13:48] <Joekage> or watch the ubisoft conference ending
[13:48] <Narayan> LOLOLOL!
[13:48] <Joekage> that shit has numbed me
[13:49] <Narayan> Seriously.
[13:49] <Narayan> Ghost Recon and Rayman Origins look awesome. Plus Shootmania and all that shit.
[13:49] <Narayan> Here's a shitty conference where no one gives a fuck... NOW HERE'S SOME AWESOME SHIT!
[13:49] <Narayan> ERIC CHAHI'S MOTHERFUCKIN' DUST!
[13:50] <RagnarokX> beautify a city by destroying a fountain and covering it in grafitti
[13:50] <Narayan> God, that was so dumb.
[13:50] <Narayan> Shaun White is just like... "lol i dunno".
[13:50] <Joekage> wait wait
[13:50] <Joekage> there's a Kinect conference tomorrow as well?
[13:50] <Joekage> what the fuck
[13:50] <RagnarokX> no
[13:51] <RagnarokX> the cirque du soleil show
[13:51] <Narayan> No. That was yesterday.
[13:51] <RagnarokX> is being shown tomorrow
[13:51] <RagnarokX> durring the Sony Con
[13:51] <Narayan> Are they broadcasting that?
[13:51] <Joekage> but 
[13:51] <Joekage> http://www.gametrailers.com/e3/livefeed/ubisoft
[13:51] <Joekage> check out the right
[13:51] <RagnarokX> at least that's what I heard
[13:52] <Joekage> so that's just a recording of the cirque du soleil show from the other day?
[13:52] <RagnarokX> yeah
[13:52] <Joekage> wow
[13:52] <RagnarokX> at least that's what I heard
[13:52] <RagnarokX> also, youtube is the best stream!
[13:54] <Narayan> Yeah. YouTube is definitely on the ball.
[13:54] <RagnarokX> I really should go to bed
[13:54] <RagnarokX> it's almost 4AM and the Nintendo con is at 9
[13:56] <Narayan> Yeah. I'm going back to bed in a couple minutes.
[13:56] <Joekage> all i want is golden sun ds
[13:56] <Joekage> thats all i want
[13:56] <Joekage> is that too much to ask?
[13:56] <Sea_Manky> fucking magnets, how do they work?
[13:56] <RagnarokX> I want Zelda to not suck
[13:56] <Axord> Joekage: yes. You shall suffer.
[13:57] <Joekage> fuck that
[13:57] <Joekage> if they don't show that shit
[13:57] * Brannon has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[13:57] <Joekage> I'm bombing Camelot studios
[13:57] <EviLore> invisibility adds a tactical element to the battlefield, indeed, ubisoft
[13:57] <EviLore> "because you can pop up"
[13:58] <EviLore> "so it's very accessible"
[13:58] * EviLore facepalm
[13:58] <RagnarokX> Invisibility sure added great value to Metroid Prime Hunters
[13:58] <Narayan> I just want another Ghost Recon like GR2.
[13:58] <Kabouter> Remember when series like Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six were awesome EviLore?
[13:58] <RagnarokX> remember when Ubisoft made that good game? Sands of Time?
[13:59] <Joekage> http://i49.tinypic.com/2vl7gq9.gif
[13:59] <Narayan> Now that shit is so streamlined. They require no fucking strategy at all.
[13:59] <Joekage> lmao
[13:59] <Narayan> REMEMBER BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL? OH WAIT. THAT SHIT IS DEAD.
[13:59] <Narayan> >:(
[13:59] <EviLore> STREAMLINED!!!!
[13:59] <Narayan> Is there a limit on the active camo?
[14:00] <Kabouter> Sounds like Endwar Narayan
[14:00] * fjolle has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[14:00] <EviLore> give me fucking S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Deus Ex or System Shock, not press A to win, you pieces of shit
[14:00] <Kabouter> Thank god they haven't fucked up Anno and unfucked Settlers
[14:00] <Narayan> Aye.
[14:00] <Narayan> Ubisoft: "We are irrelevant."
[14:00] <EviLore> I get more jaded by the day
[14:00] <EviLore> over where gaming is going
[14:00] <Kabouter> If not for those two series, Ubisoft could fuck off
[14:00] <Kabouter> We're headed towards an industry crash is where we're goingevil
[14:01] <Kabouter> Oversaturation of the marketplace with inferior products
[14:01] <Narayan> I hope so, because I can't stand it.
[14:01] <RagnarokX> well, at least Asses n' Cream 3 has horses
[14:01] <Axord> Next gen: $70 per game, standard
[14:01] <Joekage> i wouldnt be surprised
[14:01] <Kabouter> ‚Ç¨40 is the max I've paid in the past few years
[14:01] <Kabouter> ‚Ç¨60 if you also count the ‚Ç¨20 add-on :P
[14:02] * fjolle has joined #ga
[14:02] <Kabouter> (Hearts of Iron III, totally worth it though, around 100 hours played)
[14:02] <EviLore> okay, so you can go invisible at will...you can press a button that automatically highlights all the enemies on the level through walls...and you have silenced assault rifles on top of that
[14:02] <syllogism> what are you watching
[14:02] <JMerrick> what's the invisible at will? ghost recon?
[14:02] <EviLore> ubisoft conference, ghost recon future bullshit
[14:02] <Kabouter> Is there a limit to your invisibility EviLore? Some sort of timer?
[14:02] <EviLore> dunno, didn't see one
[14:02] <Kabouter> lulz
[14:02] <RagnarokX> in Arkham Asylum you could see through walls, but shit was tough
[14:03] <Sea_Manky> But it's Tom Clancy, the DBZ of modern military technology.
[14:03] <EviLore> yeah there's no indicator that invisibility is limited
[14:03] <JMerrick> semper fi :O~
[14:03] <Kabouter> "Oh yeah, here's a game for you. So you're basically a Predator, except instead of fighting badass commandos or Danny Glover, you're fighting pussy soldiers who have no means of harming you."
[14:03] <Kabouter> Semper Fi is so good
[14:04] <EviLore> but
[14:04] <EviLore> YOU FEEL LIKE SUCH A BADASS
[14:04] <RagnarokX> 'Huh, what was that noise? Oh, guess it was nothing."
[14:04] <EviLore> okay, so when you shoot someone while invisible you become visibile for ~one second, then automatically go back to invisibility
[14:05] <RagnarokX> you ever run around the boxes at the heliport in MGS1 and watch the genome soldiers go around and around in circles?
[14:05] <EviLore> very challenging
[14:05] <Narayan> If next-gen has $70 per games, I will just stick to PC, portables, and my extensive console backlog.
[14:05] <Kabouter> Yes, that does sound tough
[14:05] <Kabouter> IT sounds like Crysis if you mod the difficulty setting for automatic cheats
[14:05] <RagnarokX> lol
[14:06] <Narayan> I hope they limit the camouflage. If they don't, it will suck ass.
[14:06] <RagnarokX> at least in Metroid Prime Hunters Trace doesnt go back to invisible right away
[14:06] <Sea_Manky> don't worry, in Clancy's world they'll fix that next book^H^H^H^Hgame so that our brave supersoldiers won't be visible even when they're firing rocket launchers
[14:06] <RagnarokX> he hast to stand still for a while
[14:06] <RagnarokX> if he misses, he's open
[14:07] <Narayan> I like how everyone has a boner for MGS:R when we really haven't seen how shitty the game is yet.
[14:07] <RagnarokX> what strikes me about MGSR is that it looks nothing like a MG game
[14:07] <Narayan> Indeed.
[14:07] <RagnarokX> the setting, the other soldiers
[14:07] <Joekage> CUT
[14:07] <Kabouter> Well the demo at the MS conference was pretty shitty
[14:07] <Joekage> CUT
[14:07] <Kabouter> ZOMG TEH CUT
[14:08] <RagnarokX> the only thing about it that looks like MGS is Raiden
[14:08] <Kabouter> Not even a little bit exciting
[14:08] <RagnarokX> but he doesnt even look like Raiden
[14:08] <Kabouter> But then, that's par for the course with MGS
[14:08] * Brannon has joined #ga
[14:08] <FirewalkR> i wouldn't be surprised if they showed actual gameplay with ps move today
[14:08] <Sea_Manky> Narayan: Isn't having a boner for games you haven't seen how shitty they are the standard?
[14:08] <Narayan> "OMG YOU CAN CUT STUFF. I MUST DRINK THE MANJUICE OF KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS COMBINED."
[14:08] <Narayan> Sea_Manky: Pretty much.
[14:08] <FirewalkR> but then again, seems like this is being marketed more closely with ms
[14:09] <EviLore> wow, the reactions in the gaf thread were mostly positive
[14:09] <EviLore> "BEST GAME OF E3"
[14:09] <EviLore> "THAT LOOKED AWESOME"
[14:09] <EviLore> :|
[14:09] <RagnarokX> yeah, there were also GAFers crying that the Kinect wasn't a trainwreck
[14:09] <Kabouter> GAF am retarded, news at 11
[14:09] <Acosta> watermelon cut is fun
[14:09] <FirewalkR> perhaps we're all cynics over here, EviLore xD
[14:09] <Acosta> Kya!
[14:10] <HadesGigas> it actually looked a lot like that Itagaki game to me
[14:10] <Sea_Manky> Didn't Bungie leave MS?  Kojima would be a good replacement to keep up the level of bad fanfic-level writing.
[14:10] * mack has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[14:10] <Acosta> yo know, at least it≈õ not a shooter
[14:10] <HadesGigas> since that had a lot of slicing people with swords and cutting off parts
[14:10] <EviLore> what's awesome is taking down a large encampment of korean soldiers in crysis with just your bare hands and nanosuit powers, on delta difficulty
[14:10] <Acosta> is almost a miracle
[14:10] <EviLore> not fucking god mode
[14:10] <Narayan> Since when was cutting in a video game innovative or AMAZING?
[14:11] <Narayan> Been doing that shit in Ninja Gaiden for god knows how long.
[14:11] <FirewalkR> i hope they didn't screw things (or streamline too much) with the new nanosuit powers
[14:11] <Acosta> yeah, but that is cutting EVOLVED
[14:11] <HadesGigas> well in the Metal Gear game it looks like the gimmick is "cut anything anyway"
[14:11] <Narayan> I hope VanQuish is playable.
[14:11] <Sea_Manky> Narayan: It's geo-mod for WATERMELONS.
[14:11] <Narayan> Sea_Manky: OH GOD. THEN IT MUST BE THE BESTEST GAME EVER!
[14:11] <HadesGigas> instead of scripted "cut person in half" stuff
[14:12] <RagnarokX> can you cut cans of metal gear soda?
[14:12] <FirewalkR> perhaps you can cut the whole buildings and not just the support columns? /wishful thinking
[14:12] <Narayan> Nah. Metal Gear Soda is impervious to BULLSHIT, I'm afraid.
[14:12] <Sea_Manky> I should actually read some E3 stuff, get some photoshops
[14:12] <Sea_Manky> so far I've only seen the watermelon thing and the kinect/wrestler gif
[14:13] <EviLore> "Ghost Recon was awesome, this is a good mix of action and classic GR gameplay, and full 4 player co-op campaign." -Ether_Snake
[14:13] * Jide has joined #ga
[14:13] <Acosta> you are missing out Sea_Manky
[14:13] <Acosta> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTYtH28esTg
[14:13] <RagnarokX> Ether Snake has been inhaling too much ether
[14:13] <Joekage> watermelon thing?
[14:13] <Joekage> someone please clue me in on this
[14:13] <Joekage> i've avoided most of E3 like the plague
[14:14] <HadesGigas> raiden chopped watermelons in mg rising
[14:14] <FirewalkR> what's the mainstream media reaction to kinect thus far? seems to me like MS just handed E3 to nintendo and sony... for what it's worth
[14:14] <Joekage> oh yeah
[14:14] <EviLore> four invisible players with silenced weapons and scifi enemy sensors vs small numbers of 20th century grunts
[14:14] <Sea_Manky> oh god
[14:14] <RagnarokX> The mainstream media's reaction to Kinect has been "Holy crap free 360 Slims!"
[14:14] <Narayan> I don't know why folks want ZOE3 when the first two games were shit.
[14:14] <Narayan> ZOE1: Shit.
[14:14] <Narayan> ZOE2: Slightly less shit.
[14:14] <HadesGigas> but yeah pretty disappointing e3 so far
[14:14] <Acosta> die
[14:14] <Sea_Manky> Acosta, look, I want funny photoshops, I don't want to want to kill myself
[14:15] <RagnarokX> ZOE is not shit
[14:15] <Acosta> hahahaha
[14:15] <RagnarokX> Narayan loses cool points
[14:15] <Narayan> Okay. Okay. ZOE2 was alright.
[14:15] <Narayan> The first one was NOT GOOD.
[14:15] <HadesGigas> best new game reveal, Rayman. Until Back to the Future shows up
[14:15] <RagnarokX> ZOE1 was good if you just ignore the rescue mission
[14:15] <RagnarokX> s
[14:15] <Acosta> the first one was a cool extra for metal gear solid 2 demo
[14:15] <Narayan> I did. I didn't like it.
[14:15] <RagnarokX> and the voice acting
[14:16] <Narayan> Unfortunately, cut-scenes were 90% of the game.
[14:16] <RagnarokX> I remember beating ZOE1
[14:16] <RagnarokX> and I was like
[14:16] <RagnarokX> That was it?
[14:16] <RagnarokX> The final boss is just running away
[14:17] <Narayan> ZOE2 was more flash and less substance. It was just a game where you did shit that looked cool.
[14:17] <Sea_Manky> the complaints about the ZOE rescue mission baffle me about as much as the complaints about the RC plane mission in GTA:SA.  I don't know how people found them to be so hard.
[14:17] <RagnarokX> have you see the bad bad ending of ZOE1, Narayan?
[14:17] <Narayan> The gameplay was easy to get bored of. For me, anyway.
[14:17] <Narayan> Yeah, I have.
[14:17] <RagnarokX> if you get all E ranks in the rescue missions
[14:18] <RagnarokX> I remember the press was hyping ZOE because it was going to be the first game with a moral system where your actions affected the outcomes
[14:18] <RagnarokX> but there were only 3 possible outcomes
[14:18] <Narayan> lol
[14:19] <RagnarokX> to get the good ending you had to S rank every rescue mission
[14:19] <RagnarokX> and to get the bad ending you had to E rank every mission
[14:20] <RagnarokX> but it did come with a demo for MGS2
[14:20] <RagnarokX> which was better than the actual MGS2
[14:20] <RagnarokX> because it didn't have the plant chapter

[14:27] <KimiNewt> I think like 160
[14:27] <Rotanibor> this is like warcraft the fighting game
[14:27] <Rotanibor> check out that orc
[14:27] <fjolle> way too many
[14:27] <KimiNewt> I'm wondering, is there anyway I can watch the conference on my iPhone?
[14:27] <avcables> i was wondering the same thing
[14:27] <EviLore> yes
[14:27] <EviLore> details are on gaf
[14:27] <EviLore> for various streaming
[14:28] <Jide> yeah brit
[14:28] <KimiNewt> But which one'll work with the iPhone
[14:29] <avcables> the ustream one should work with the ustream app
[14:29] <avcables> even though the app sucks

[14:38] <EviLore> and here I thought last year's ubisoft conference was the worst ever
[14:38] <EviLore> 2010 sets a new standard
[14:38] <avcables> oh shit i totally forgot they had their conference last night
[14:38] <avcables> was it shit?
[14:38] <EviLore> just finishing watching now
[14:38] <avcables> haha
[14:38] <avcables> can't wait
[14:38] <avcables> e3 really means entertainment
[14:38] <TToB> Activision sounded pretty terrible.
[14:39] <KimiNewt> Activision wasn't really a conference was it?
[14:39] <TToB> Sounded like a free concert with no games.
[14:39] <EviLore> they're doing some west side story shit on stage now
[14:39] <EviLore> to wrap it up
[14:39] <EviLore> amazing, ubisoft, amazing
[14:40] <KimiNewt> This "E3 of forever" bullshit is bullshit
[14:41] <KimiNewt> We've had three conferences and got like three new games
[14:41] <avcables> peter molyneux is such a bullshitter it makes me want to buy 300 copies of his games
[14:42] <Joekage> beat it
[14:42] <Joekage> beat it
[14:44] <avcables> lol halo cultural phenomenon
[14:45] <avcables> this guy is almost better than molyneux
[14:46] <avcables> there is a separate kinect conference tonight?
[14:47] <fjolle> no its the cirque de soleil show
[14:47] <fjolle> i think
[14:47] <avcables> i thought that was sunday
[14:47] <fjolle> yea but they haven't broadcast it yet
[14:47] <avcables> ah
[14:56] <avcables> uh
[14:56] <avcables> justin beiber
[14:56] <avcables> what a shit idea
[14:56] <Sea_Manky> Anyone "anticipating" E3 nowadays needs their head examined.
[14:56] <avcables> im anticipating it
[14:56] <avcables> for this hilarious shit
[14:57] <fjolle> ninty conference will be 50% sales stats

[15:00] <EviLore> I can't stand playing modern games on the PSP :/
[15:00] <SSFKyori4> ported to what.
[15:00] <EviLore> a platform that doesn't suck
[15:00] <SSFKyori4> not happening :P
[15:00] <avcables> so pc then
[15:01] <EviLore> not happening based on what
[15:01] <SSFKyori4> portable ops never made it.
[15:01] <EviLore> portable ops sucks and isn't a real MGS game
[15:01] <SSFKyori4> and really. the ps2 is dead.
[15:01] * Luckett has joined #ga
[15:02] <avcables> what does PS2 have to do with it
[15:02] <SSFKyori4> if they were to port it anywhere :P
[15:02] <Joekage> kiry!
[15:02] <SSFKyori4> yo joe.
[15:02] <Joekage> sup sup
[15:02] <SSFKyori4> or. you can hope for a wii port! ha ha ha
[15:03] <EviLore> if it's never ported, I'll wait for PSP emulation and dual analog hacks
[15:03] <Luckett> peace walker?
[15:03] <EviLore> yes
[15:03] <SSFKyori4> heh whats amusing to me actually is how there has been no psp emulation yet.
[15:03] <Luckett> shit is goooooood
[15:03] <Jide> its out over here in 3 days!
[15:03] * frankie_baby has joined #ga
[15:03] <avcables> it's not amusing, it's just because psp has no games
[15:03] <Luckett> i broke down and got the US PSN version
[15:03] <avcables> until now with peace walker
[15:03] <SSFKyori4> Joekage: were you tonight? i was barely. but crappy night. empty and uh folks playing random 
[15:03] <avcables> so im sure we'll see an emu in a week or two
[15:04] <Joekage> Um
[15:04] <Joekage> I cut my coerna
[15:04] <Joekage> cornea
[15:04] <SSFKyori4> o-o
[15:04] <Luckett> couldnt wait for euro release, especially during that brief "lol july 18th" delay that was a cock-up
[15:04] <Jide> any extras with the eu version?
[15:04] <Joekage> yeah, I am wearing an eyepatch right now
[15:04] <SSFKyori4> howd you do that.
[15:04] <Joekage> so I decided to take a break and just stick to training mode
[15:04] <avcables> man you know that E3 crowd was like what the fuck is espohhhhhh
[15:04] * Vic has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[15:04] <Joekage> at work, ash got into my eye and scratched my eye underneath my contact
[15:04] <SSFKyori4> dual analog hacks wouldnt do much for peace walker tho. its built around the psp.
[15:05] <Luckett> dual analog would make the game too easy
[15:05] <EviLore> *shrug*, whatever
[15:05] <SSFKyori4> Joekage: yow.
[15:05] <avcables> aw man
[15:05] <Luckett> game has the best bosses of the entire series though, no joke
[15:05] <avcables> that would've been awesome if they elaborated on the sportscenter thing
[15:05] <EviLore> no interest in playing psp games, even if it's metal gear
[15:05] <avcables> ran up to arnold palmer
[15:05] <Luckett> the AI Bosses are great fun
[15:05] <Joekage> so yeah, I kind of justyeah, gonna take it slow until it hea;s
[15:06] <Luckett> as are the enemy vehicle fights
[15:06] <Joekage> heals* Gonna do more lab work than anything
[15:06] <Jide> ok no spoilers! ;p
[15:06] <Joekage> researching combos, matchups and etc
[15:06] <SSFKyori4> sorry to hear that.
[15:06] <SSFKyori4> sounds painful d:
[15:06] <Joekage> haha just a little but it's all good

[15:06] <Joekage> if they dont

[15:07] <SSFKyori4> they did announce golden sun tho

[15:08] <Joekage> Give me a trailer or a date and I'm good
[15:08] <Jide> its actually painful that you're watching a conference waiting for a company to announce at least one "real game" how times have changed :(
[15:08] <SSFKyori4> i wanna see the 3ds
[15:08] <frankie_baby> what if the date aint for a very loooong time
[15:09] <Luckett> how are they going to show the 3ds, it confuses me. all screens and videos will just look 2d
[15:09] <Joekage> I can wait
[15:09] <Luckett> its a marketing nightmare
[15:09] <Joekage> I think they'll leave the 3ds impressions to the press
[15:09] <Joekage> like they'll talk about it
[15:09] <HadesGigas> But yeah Namco is gonna whore the fuck out of Pac-Man this year, it's gonna be crazy
[15:09] <Joekage> show it off
[15:09] <Joekage> but leave the actual impressions to various blogs and etc
[15:09] <Luckett> they'll have to give them all free 3DS' i guess!
[15:10] <avcables> i heard they were going to announce 3DS Wii connectively to play their new pac-man game
[15:10] <SSFKyori4> i should get some sleep before the conf

[15:18] <HadesGigas> i hated it cause it was less clutterd... but none of the things people use were there

[16:15] <impiri> you mean where they show a still frame and then highlight the offsides portion of the field?
[16:15] <fjolle> you need 2 people in front of the player when the ball is passed.

[16:20] <stump> Animal: yeah, updated specs and enclosure
[16:20] <squarepeg> From what I read online, the preorders went up at like 3am
[16:20] <Animal> praise the heavens
[16:20] <stump> still too expensive to be cheap and too cheap to have any horsepower
[16:20] <squarepeg> And then Apple's servers crashed about 2 min later
[16:20] <impiri> with HDMI!
[16:21] <Animal> HDMI wut
[16:22] <EviLore> ah yes, just tried, at&t side fails when I select upgrade
[16:22] <Animal> wow its so hot
[16:22] <impiri> the best part is you don't need to pry it open to replace the RAM
[16:22] <stump> I'm a little disappointed that they didn't update the AppleTV after. I really like mine, it's great, it's compact, it's silent, it gets the job done... but it doesn't do 1080p videos or high bitrate 720p videos. :/
[16:22] <EviLore> *shrug*, will be able to do it later today I"m sure
[16:22] <EviLore> site*
[16:22] <Animal> I don't understand people who buy apple tv and are serious about home entertainement
[16:22] <Animal> makes no sense
[16:22] <Animal> mac mini people
[16:23] <stump> again, other than not doing high bitrate 720p or any 1080p, the apple tv does everything else quite well
[16:23] <darkh_coffee> yeah the new mac mini is nice
[16:23] * darkh_coffee is now known as darkh23
[16:23] <stump> i've got around 4 tb of media, it works swimmingly for all of it except what i just mentioned
[16:23] <fjolle> isn't it like 999$?
[16:23] <impiri> the best part of the mini is that it also acts as a home server with very little power draw
[16:23] <stump> fjolle: the mac mini is 699/999, the apple tv is 169/209 or something i can't remember
[16:23] <Animal> yeah but 720p and 1080p is too big of a feature
[16:23] <impiri> and an irc bouncer, woohoo
[16:24] <Animal> the mac mini will let you surf the net from your couch and do all computer stuff too
[16:24] <stump> Animal: i guess, i don't have a blu-ray drive in my pc so i can't rip my BRDs anyway, so I don't actually have much 720p/1080p content except movie trailers and gametrailers reviews
[16:24] <stump> Animal: I would think most people for couch surfing would use a laptop or netbook. *shrugs*
[16:24] <EviLore> so, wait, what do you mean by the ball has to travel
[16:24] <Animal> nono not when people are over
[16:25] <squarepeg> yeah the mac mini as a home server is great
[16:25] <Animal> you want it up on the big tv
[16:25] <stump> Animal: you mean for like youtube and stuff?
[16:25] * MiGvuzela has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[16:25] <Animal> no, appletv already has youtube
[16:25] <squarepeg> No one can preorder the iPhone 4 online
[16:25] <Animal> anything
[16:25] <squarepeg> Or make that very few can.  Apple's website has been going down repeatedly
[16:25] <squarepeg> Same with AT&T's.
[16:25] <fjolle> the smallest one is 1025$ here :s
[16:25] <EviLore> still wrapping my head around this stupid rule, like I do every world cup
[16:25] <impiri> i thought the thing about soccer was that offsides is determined by where everyone is when the ball is passed, not when it is received
[16:26] <Animal> EviLore: draw a line that intersects both defensement
[16:26] <fjolle> thats right.
[16:26] <darkh23> no surprise with iphone....it's the first major redesign of it....it's gonna sell faster than the previous ones most likely
[16:26] <Animal> ball must go first
[16:27] <EviLore> ah ok, that makes sense, but what about the two people thing
[16:27] <Animal> what two people thing?
[16:27] <impiri> one of the people is the goalkeeper typically
[16:27] <fjolle> two players from the opposite team has to be in front of the guy that is passed to. normally one of them is the gk

[16:35] <squarepeg> I guess apparently everyone wants the phone on launch day
[16:35] <squarepeg> From what I read online, the preorders went up at like 3am
[16:35] <squarepeg> And then Apple's servers crashed about 2 min later
[16:36] <Animal> Wow I just realized I've been in here doing the GAF E3 irc thing for 5 years now
[16:36] <EviLore> the best part is that the error message on at&t's site tells you to call customer service and tell them the error number.  I bet the phone reps love that
[16:37] <darkh23> lol
[16:37] <darkh23> apple's preorder process on their store dies when it tries to contact AT&T to check eligibiltiy
[16:37] <stump> hahaha any error page that says "please contact the server admin" or "please contact tech support" is the worst thing ever
[16:37] <darkh23> yes
[16:38] <Animal> darkh23: you're right. the machines in the stores are also crashing for them on launch day and they have to do it all over the phone with AT&T
[16:38] <darkh23> "please contact your systems administrator"
[16:38] <Animal> happens everytime
[16:38] <impiri> please email null@example.com
[16:38] <stump> i just picture some geriatric 22-term congressman repeatedly calling darkh23's cell phone over and over again
[16:38] <darkh23> lol
[16:40] * Lovingsteam has joined #ga
[16:40] <darkh23> wonder what the problem is that they cut out white preorders at the last minute
[16:41] <impiri> racism
[16:41] <Animal> what do you mean dark?
[16:41] <squarepeg> I think apple assumed that black would be more popular
[16:42] <squarepeg> And then when interest in white grew they realized they wouldn't have enough to meet demand
[16:42] <squarepeg> so they cut the ability to preorder white for now

[16:58] <Animal> lol its making fun of south africa
[16:58] <stump> also i resent the implication that bagpipes are somehow less annoying than BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[16:59] <Animal> we use that shit in hockey all the time
[16:59] <Animal> they are a bunch of pussies complaining about those
[16:59] <TToB> stump: A bagpipe being blown with one note would be annoying as fuck
[16:59] <stump> TToB: bagpipes only have "one note"; strangled cat
[16:59] <TToB> lol

[17:24] <Joekage> true that
[17:24] <ryaxnb> impiri, theyre discontinuing arcade.
[17:25] <ryaxnb> so you mean $450
[17:25] <darkh23> they seem to think the conference was bad, but they are still interested in the technology
[17:25] <Unison_> #ga is more real talk
[17:25] <impiri> wait, so they're ditching the lower price point altogether?
[17:25] <Unison_> they are praising the interface
[17:25] <ryaxnb> so far as we know
[17:25] <stump> for now, yes, but i suspect they will drop the 360 to 199 in the fall
[17:25] <ryaxnb> yes
[17:25] <Joekage> Supposedly
[17:25] <impiri> huh
[17:25] <Joekage> They're going to introduce a $199 version of the new xbox, 
[17:26] <Joekage> as the new arcade
[17:26] <Joekage> but not right now
[17:26] <squarepeg> Why didn't Microsoft show off Child of Eden during the Kinect portion of the conference?  That was sweet.
[17:26] <Unison_> too good 
[17:26] <Unison_> would make everything else look lousy
[17:26] <Y2Kev> Do you think Miz was playing it live?
[17:26] <Joekage> Because they don't want to please their core gamers, they want Nintendos money lol
[17:26] <Unison_> even though it's just microwaved Rez
[17:26] <impiri> i saw the entire ubi conference except for child of eden
[17:26] <impiri> sigh
[17:26] <Luckett> Move version os Rez 2 will be so much more superior
[17:26] <Luckett> that GIANT aiming reticule
[17:26] <Unison_> it was uninspiring imp
[17:26] <squarepeg> I couldn't tell if Miz was playing it live or not.  A few times it seemed like he wasn't
[17:26] <Luckett> on Kinect
[17:26] <Unison_> have you played rez?
[17:27] <impiri> yep, really enjoyed it
[17:27] <Unison_> imagine that w/ motion controls & a giant targeting reticle
[17:27] <Luckett> unison are you not excited about LASER TAG
[17:27] <Y2Kev> lol
[17:27] <Unison_> i am excited to see how much it costs
[17:27] <squarepeg> I am not at all opposed to Child of Eden being nothing more than HD Rez with Kinect controls
[17:27] <Unison_> haha
[17:27] <squarepeg> Doesn't bother me one bit
[17:27] <Y2Kev> most shooter fans dont like rez...it's not really much of a shooter
[17:27] <Luckett> that laser tag segment still melts my mind
[17:27] <impiri> i could get drunk and enjoy that
[17:27] <Unison_> i mean CoE isn't good or bad really
[17:27] <impiri> BATTLE TAG
[17:27] <Luckett> did no-one sort of...show them it exists already?
[17:27] <syllogism> rez zzz
[17:27] <Unison_> it's just mediocre
[17:27] <Jide> oh so its on ps3? as well
[17:27] <Luckett> like in all toy store
[17:28] <darkh23> haha I followed gerstmann on twitter
[17:28] <Joekage> the worst was the michael jackson dance off thing
[17:28] <Luckett> ever
[17:28] <Jide> i thought i would have to stomach natal
[17:28] <Jide> phew
[17:28] <Unison_> worst was still the girl saying I love you to Skittles
[17:28] <Luckett> are they doing an MJ game or was that just a random show
[17:28] <impiri> hahaha
[17:28] <threivuzela> damn
[17:28] <Luckett> i still dont know
[17:28] <threivuzela> dude got cleated and ref didn't even care
[17:28] <threivuzela> wtf is up with this ref
[17:28] * Axord has quit IRC (Quit: I'm sure it's perfectly safe)
[17:28] <impiri> the michael jackson thing was the most inexplicable
[17:29] <stump> Luckett: they are doing a game, they released screenshots after
[17:29] <impiri> what the fuck did that MEAN
[17:29] <Joekage> i guess it was to promote the dance off game
[17:29] <Joekage> but like
[17:29] <Joekage> they didn't even mentionit
[17:29] <Unison_> no, it's a separate game
[17:29] <Unison_> here's a screenshot: http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/comment/9/2010/06/09d61e90744856b74322579331cbb790/340x.jpg
[17:29] <Jide> they don't need too
[17:29] <Joekage> oh
[17:29] <Jide> I think you can figure it out how its going to work
[17:29] <impiri> hahaha
[17:29] <Joekage> i just heard beat it and people were like wtf
[17:30] <Unison_> jk, here's a real screen : http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2010/06/500x_screenshot_billie_jean_01.jpg
[17:30] <squarepeg> They just wanted an excuse to get models out on stage dancing
[17:30] <squarepeg> The new Ghost Recon looked amazing, though
[17:30] <stump> i thought it looked kinda casualized!
[17:30] <impiri> i thought they were using a cheat code
[17:30] <Luckett> you are entirely invisible for the whole level
[17:30] <impiri> you get to be invisible all the time?
[17:30] <Jide> itv player just died for me wes is it working for you
[17:30] <impiri> and the enemies have the worst vision ever
[17:31] <Luckett> well it puts the GHOST back into Ghost Recon
[17:31] <Luckett> HAYOOOOOOO
[17:31] <ghst> yeah. what the hell with everyone saying ghost recon looked amazing, have we slipped that low that gears of war with predator mode passes for groundbreaking?
[17:31] <squarepeg> lol
[17:31] <impiri> inviso-soldier was standing RIGHT IN FRONT of an enemy and he didn't react at all
[17:31] <squarepeg> I didn't say it was groundbreaking
[17:31] <Y2Kev> Acosta: http://i49.tinypic.com/2vl7gq9.gif
[17:31] <Luckett> i think it was just a nice vaguely fresh setting compared to everything else
[17:31] * Somnia has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[17:31] <squarepeg> I just said it looked amazing
[17:31] <Y2Kev> thank you for this gif
[17:31] <Y2Kev> it is a treasure
[17:31] <ghst> fresh?
[17:31] <Luckett> well not vietnam
[17:31] <Luckett> or new york
[17:32] <squarepeg> Hey where's the gif of that guy doing the Kinect dancing
[17:32] <ghst> tps shooter dotted with chest high walls and dumb as shit cannon fodder for you to mow down at your will?
[17:32] <Unison_> Driver was hilarious
[17:32] <Unison_> Ghost Driver
[17:32] <Luckett> hahaha
[17:32] <Unison_> in a coma
[17:32] <Unison_> or something
[17:32] <Luckett> the coma reveal
[17:32] <ghst> sounds like the last 4 years to me.
[17:32] <Luckett> my god
[17:32] <Luckett> i lost it
[17:32] <ghst> halo looks the same.
[17:32] <Tre`Kage> chest high walls!
[17:32] <Luckett> it was all like "this is standard" until BOMBS WERE DROPPED
[17:32] <Tre`Kage> COVER SYSTEMZ
[17:32] <ghst> cod looks the same.
[17:32] <EviLore> gears looks the same
[17:32] <Jide> driver was LOL
[17:32] <EviLore> dead space looks the same
[17:32] <EviLore> and on and on
[17:33] <Unison_> lol EviLore 
[17:33] <ghst> it's just as insulting as the natal shit.
[17:33] <Y2Kev> halo has spaceships
[17:33] <Y2Kev> lol
[17:33] <Luckett> halo looked awful
[17:33] <ghst> but it's okay
[17:33] <ghst> they're HARDCORE
[17:33] <Luckett> completely phoned in
[17:33] <threivuzela> omfg
[17:33] <squarepeg> Hopefully Metroid: Other M today will be awesome
[17:33] <threivuzela> what in the fuck
[17:33] <Jide> Unison don't even know why they bothered to revive driver
[17:33] <Jide> they already killed it once
[17:33] <Luckett> awesome level design: here are some rocks and enemies, this is a corridor, now we are in space
[17:33] <Unison_> they didnt kill it, it was just in a coma
[17:33] <Tre`Kage> jide:  they didn't revive it..
[17:33] <Tre`Kage> FUCK YOU UNISON
[17:34] <ghst> vehicle sections are the new turret sections.
[17:34] <Unison_> ^5 
[17:34] <Tre`Kage> ^5
[17:34] <Tre`Kage> <3
[17:34] <Jide> LOL
[17:34] * Somnia has joined #ga
[17:34] <EviLore> at least duels of the planeswalkers comes out today
[17:34] <Narayan> YOU'RE NOT ALEXANDER!
[17:34] <Tre`Kage> yeah
[17:34] <EviLore> that's something to look forward to
[17:34] <Unison_> ooh
[17:34] <Tre`Kage> 2 1/2 hours!
[17:34] <Unison_> haha 
[17:34] <Narayan> I'm not hu~rt!
[17:35] <Unison_> you can bail on the nintendo conference
[17:35] <darkh23> not sure I want to get that
[17:35] <darkh23> I probably won't play it much
[17:35] <Narayan> I'm Alexander the Great!
[17:35] <Luckett> i wonder what new mario game there will be
[17:35] <Luckett> mario 3ds i guess
[17:35] <Unison_> haha
[17:35] <Unison_> 3ds has serious E3 winning power
[17:35] <Narayan> I'm brutal and ruthless!
[17:35] <Unison_> it doesnt have to be much
[17:35] <Y2Kev> http://i48.tinypic.com/epk4fa.jpg
[17:35] <Y2Kev> o
[17:35] <Y2Kev> oh man
[17:35] <Unison_> and it will take the cake
[17:36] <Y2Kev> another faked demo?
[17:36] <Narayan> (Has no one played God Hand?) :(
[17:36] <Unison_> just lag probably
[17:36] <Luckett> i have, its awesome
[17:36] <Unison_> natal is so buggy
[17:36] <Y2Kev> Unison: his BODY is lagging
[17:36] <Unison_> God Hand's great
[17:36] <Y2Kev> the hand appears on screen
[17:36] <Y2Kev> before he moves his hand
[17:36] <Unison_> lol
[17:36] <Luckett> man 3ds, cant wait to be rid of DS 3d forever
[17:36] <Narayan> <3 God Hand.
[17:36] <stump> Y2Kev: it's e3, all of the demos are either prerecorded or live with cheat codes
[17:36] <Luckett> like the end of a bad dream
[17:36] <squarepeg> Anyone have the gif of that guy doing the Kinect dancing yesterday during MS's conference?
[17:36] <Unison_> yeah, you cant judge final products
[17:36] <Y2Kev> i don't think the Your Fitness demo was prerecorded
[17:36] <Unison_> based on e3 demos
[17:36] <ryaxnb> 3ds is e3 winning
[17:36] <ryaxnb> and think... zelda wii
[17:36] <ryaxnb> one-two punch
[17:37] * BossG has left #ga
[17:37] <DeezNutz> zelda wii and 3ds alone will win it for nintendo
[17:37] <ryaxnb> one-two-three if they anounce pikmin 3... on 3ds.
[17:37] <Luckett> zelda wii having the same old twilight artstyle is lame
[17:37] <Luckett> very boring
[17:37] <DeezNutz> retro's donkey kong game
[17:37] <Tre`Kage> heh
[17:37] <squarepeg> Unless Playstation Move is completely badass, Nintendo's got this E3
[17:37] <ghst> watching the forza demo was like watching some north koeran documentary where they're spinning their deity on earth shit.
[17:37] <ryaxnb> Luckett, theres no other game on other consoles like zelda :(
[17:37] <Y2Kev> Or the Rez 2 demo
[17:37] <Tre`Kage> apparently trackmania 2 can run at 50-60 fps on an Acer Revo
[17:37] <ryaxnb> I personally not a big fan of zelda.
[17:37] <Y2Kev> frankly I just think these demos are proof of concept at the natal event
[17:37] <darkh23> I think a lot of the lag we've been seeing, especially on that EA fitness game where they had wii/natal/Move all at once is because of the video feeds needing to be split and then pushed to an HDTV and a projector
[17:37] <Tre`Kage> not with highest settings, of course
[17:37] <Y2Kev> they don't really have any gameplay to show.
[17:37] <ryaxnb> but i respect it. I'm more excited for Pikmin 3.-
[17:37] <Unison_> what is an acer revo?
[17:37] <ryaxnb> (if it shows)
[17:37] <Animal> I want uncharted 3 announcement lol
[17:37] <Unison_> a netbook?
[17:38] <Luckett> i still think that pikmin thing was a misunderstanding
[17:38] <ryaxnb> its possible.
[17:38] <Tre`Kage> seems like some mini PC dealio
[17:38] <Luckett> and they just meant New Play Control versions
[17:38] <ryaxnb> pikmin is coming out.
[17:38] <Tre`Kage> like HTPC
[17:38] <Tre`Kage> http://www.newegg.com/Product/ImageGallery.aspx?CurImage=83-103-228-TS&ISList=83-103-228-Z01,83-103-228-Z02,83-103-228-Z03,83-103-228-Z04,83-103-228-Z05,83-103-228-Z06,83-103-228-Z07&S7ImageFlag=1&Item=N82E16883103228&Depa=0&WaterMark=1&Description=Acer%20Aspire%20Revo%20AR1600-U910H%20Intel%20Atom%20230(1.6GHz)%201GB%20DDR2%20160GB%20NVIDIA%20ION%20LE%20graphics%20Windows%20XP%20Home
[17:38] <ryaxnb> no, it is coming out,. its confirmed.
[17:38] <Unison_> ahh
[17:38] <ryaxnb> but it could be years away.
[17:38] <Luckett> kirby wii...
[17:38] <ryaxnb> Luckett, also coming out.
[17:38] <Animal> the ghost recon demo though was bad ass
[17:38] <Animal> that game looks ace
[17:38] <ghst> eurgh
[17:38] <ryaxnb> Luckett, but again, could be years away.
[17:39] <Luckett> blegh, english VA for Birth by Sleep is terrrrrrible
[17:39] <Mandoric> that is one expensive-looking clock radio
[17:39] <ryaxnb> were just hoping they have some pikmin/starfox/fzero/DK something cool like that.m
[17:39] <Luckett> Nimoy sounds like he is gargling his own lungs throughout
[17:39] <Luckett> can barely understand
[17:39] <Tre`Kage> Florent posting on the new Maniaplanet forums
[17:39] <ryaxnb> there are some hints that they would "like to" make pikmin 3 as soon as possible.
[17:39] <Unison_> memory units don't work on the new xbox
[17:39] <Unison_> haha
[17:39] <ryaxnb> whether they will or not who knows?
[17:39] <Tre`Kage> as usual, really
[17:39] <Joekage> 2 hours
[17:39] <Joekage> and then
[17:39] <ryaxnb> Unison, replaced with USB cards.
[17:39] <Joekage> GOLDEUN SUN DS
[17:39] <Unison_> that's why they started letting people use usb, yeah
[17:39] <Joekage> GOLDEN*
[17:40] <Unison_> still, funny
[17:40] <Joekage> i am so hype
[17:40] <Tiduz> hmmmmmmmmmmm
[17:40] <Luckett> golden sun will surely have moved to 3ds by now
[17:40] <Tiduz> Everything will stay the same for PSN members. No worries about that.
[17:40] <Tiduz> Actually, they will get something extra for free thanks to PSN+ members.
[17:40] <Tiduz> I should stop now...
[17:40] <ryaxnb> expect coverage of Metroid Other M and Epic Mickey.
[17:40] <Tiduz> wonder what it is
[17:40] <Joekage> If it's 3DS I'm raging
[17:40] <ryaxnb> those are CONFIRMED
[17:40] <Joekage> hard
[17:40] <Unison_> if golden sun ds is a 3ds launch game... :D~~~
[17:40] <Luckett> cant wait for all Level 5's stuff to miss the DS and PSP
[17:40] <ryaxnb> Pokemon too
[17:40] <Luckett> fuckbrains
[17:40] <Tiduz> MARIO 3DS or GTFO
[17:40] <Y2Kev> i wonder if Twisted Metal X is at the show
[17:40] <Tiduz> Y2Kev: s it DJaffe?
[17:40] <Animal> if the 3ds makes you put on glasses to play i will stop watching the stream
[17:40] <Tiduz> if so :lol
[17:40] <Y2Kev> i dunno
[17:40] <Luckett> jaffe isnt there supposedly
[17:40] <ryaxnb> Mario 3ds... im hoping for  Metroid Prime Remake on 3ds.
[17:40] <Unison_> kev what time is sony?
[17:40] <Unison_> i have to figure out if i need to leave work early
[17:40] <Y2Kev> 3PM EST
[17:40] <Tre`Kage> oh snap
[17:41] <Tre`Kage> that snow environment in the Maniaplanet trailer
[17:41] <ryaxnb> like, a full remake of the gamecube version, as close as possible.
[17:41] <Unison_> ok, i will stay here at work
[17:41] <Tre`Kage> is from shootmania
[17:41] <Tre`Kage> not trackmania
[17:41] <Tre`Kage> fap

[17:41] <Unison_> it better not be longer than 2 horus
[17:41] <Unison_> hours
[17:41] <Unison_> haha
[17:41] <Y2Kev> no
[17:41] <Tiduz> TTP the sony fanboy confirmed it
[17:41] <Y2Kev> i think its 3 hours
[17:41] <darkh23> I'll miss half the sony one
[17:41] <darkh23> oh well
[17:41] <Y2Kev> er
[17:41] <Y2Kev> 2
[17:41] <Tiduz> wtf is the new thing for normal psn owners :o
[17:41] <Y2Kev> with PSN+ and Move
[17:41] <ryaxnb> i know it will never come out.
[17:41] <ghst> ubi are so weird. they love and hate pc gaming all at the same time.
[17:41] <Unison_> just hang out at work dark
[17:41] <Y2Kev> being a lot of time
[17:41] <ryaxnb> but a guy can dream.
[17:41] <Unison_> or is that not possible @ your job
[17:41] <darkh23> haha no thanks
[17:41] <ryaxnb> if they make mario kart 3ds a launch title i will shit my pants.
[17:41] <Unison_> lol!
[17:41] <Luckett> wonder if they'll dangle that Scott Pilgrim carrot
[17:41] * bufko has joined #ga
[17:41] <darkh23> hang out at work and miss the early train for sony?
[17:41] <Luckett> TIMED EXCLUSIVE
[17:41] <Unison_> you can #ga
[17:41] <ryaxnb> i love mario kart.
[17:41] <darkh23> are you mad
[17:41] <Unison_> on the train
[17:41] <Luckett> (with no online)
[17:41] <Unison_> true, it's sony
[17:41] <Unison_> haha
[17:42] <darkh23> true I can IRC
[17:42] <bufko> 1:20 until meltdown :)
[17:42] <Unison_> if it was nintendo
[17:42] * bufko is now known as bufbaf
[17:42] <Unison_> you'd be sticking around
[17:42] <Unison_> i am sure
[17:42] <Unison_> :D
[17:42] <Unison_> for zelda
[17:42] <ghst> on one hand, you have horseshit drm, weird regional restrictions and hella delays. on the other you have them releasing sub sims, god sims and trackmania as pc exlcusives.
[17:42] <ryaxnb> mario kart is never and has never been a launch title, except maybe GBA :(
[17:42] <Y2Kev> I think I will be missing the end of nintendo
[17:42] <ryaxnb> but i can dream.
[17:42] <Y2Kev> and the beginning of sony
[17:42] <Y2Kev> so i'm afraid of that
[17:42] <darkh23> course IRC from the train will just be annoying....just gonna be a stream of "OMG MOVE I LOVE MOTION CONTROLS NOW"
[17:42] <Luckett> the end of nintendo...
[17:42] <darkh23> and moving too fast
[17:42] <ryaxnb> Y2Kev, i will be missing the end of sony.
[17:42] <Unison_> get your priorities straight dude
[17:42] <Unison_> lol dark
[17:42] <ryaxnb> e3 is #1
[17:42] <ryaxnb> priority.
[17:43] <ghst> i'm gonna miss all of sony
[17:43] <Unison_> good man, ghst
[17:43] <Y2Kev> ghst: here i will spoil
[17:43] <Y2Kev> OMG THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY
[17:43] * Tiduz preorders move
[17:43] <ryaxnb> i'll be at home until just around 2:00
[17:43] <Y2Kev> 5.99 a month
[17:43] <Y2Kev> ~fin~
[17:43] <Luckett> i am MOVE'd to tears
[17:43] <ryaxnb> what is happening?
[17:43] <darkh23> yeah remember when tiduz said he'd never buy Move and we all said "lol"
[17:43] <darkh23> yeah remember those days
[17:43] <Unison_> yeah dark
[17:43] <Unison_> haha
[17:43] <Y2Kev> i think move + rez 2 could be neat.
[17:43] <Tiduz> idc huaha
[17:43] <Mandoric> what
[17:44] <Y2Kev> but i'm not one of those "omg rez is awesome with drugz" people
[17:44] <Mandoric> wait, tiduz is actually buying something?
[17:44] <Unison_> i dont think rez 2 looked amazing at all
[17:44] <Tiduz> Im not buying natal tho
[17:44] <Tiduz> After that conference
[17:44] <stump> kev is a total etard
[17:44] <Unison_> it looked like the same shit
[17:44] <Tiduz> no thx.
[17:44] <Joekage> if i could play super with move
[17:44] <Luckett> will rez 2 cost more on PS3 because Milky is a cunt?
[17:44] <Y2Kev> Unison: well rez is not much of a shooter
[17:44] <Joekage> i would be unstoppable
[17:44] <Y2Kev> the enemies like
[17:44] <Y2Kev> don't attack
[17:44] <Unison_> or much of a rhythm game
[17:44] <Tiduz> Joekage: Tatsumaki
[17:44] <Tiduz> and then the lamp on the table goes
[17:44] <Tiduz> woot
[17:44] <Joekage> I honed my skills wishing dragonballz was real back in middle school
[17:44] <Y2Kev> imagine playing ikaruga drunk
[17:44] <Y2Kev> lol
[17:44] <Joekage> with move
[17:44] <Y2Kev> wouldn't be much fun
[17:44] <Luckett> Rez 2 looks like more rhythm stuff
[17:44] <Joekage> i could beat daigo
[17:44] <Joekage> easy
[17:44] <Luckett> with overlayed genki rockets shit going down
[17:45] <Tiduz> Y2Kev
[17:45] <Tiduz> pull some strings
[17:45] <Tiduz> trauma center hd plz

[17:45] <Y2Kev> i'm heart
[17:45] <Tiduz> haha
[17:46] <Tiduz> the little messikan
[17:46] <Unison_> i am mostly hypnotized by brad, who doesnt move or speak
[17:46] <Unison_> 90% of the time
[17:46] <darkh23> I was trying to stream yesterday and my coworker kept biching the itnernet was slow

[17:46] <Y2Kev> lol
[17:46] <Unison_> RED LIGHT!
[17:46] <ryaxnb> casuals will not devour kinect :(
[17:46] <Y2Kev> the commentator
[17:46] <Y2Kev> "dreadfully awful by the portugese"
[17:46] <Unison_> lol kev
[17:46] <Unison_> casuals would like kinect
[17:46] <Unison_> it's hard to say they'd need to buy it though
[17:47] <Unison_> they have wii
[17:47] <Unison_> i dunno that they feel they need Wii AND that crap
[17:47] <Y2Kev> i think MS is revising the price
[17:47] <Tiduz> bububu kinect has no buttonz
[17:47] <Unison_> no shit
[17:47] <Unison_> they have to
[17:47] <Unison_> no one wants it
[17:47] <Tre`Kage> "okay, QuestMania is a completely new thing, so timae will surely love it, ahah
[17:47] <Tre`Kage> we will take a little more time before the communication around it, but I can tell it will take place in different ages: each one is a different environment, equivalent to the different environments in TM."
[17:47] <Tre`Kage> niiiiice
[17:47] <Tiduz> Y2Kev:White matte kinect at twice the size
[17:47] <Tiduz> 20% off
[17:47] <Tiduz> Whats hilarious is it has its SEPERATE power brick
[17:47] <ryaxnb> Unison, would they really?
[17:48] <Tiduz> unless u use new xbox
[17:48] <ryaxnb> kinects software lacks the charm of nintys casualware IMHO
[17:48] <Luckett> new xbox which still has power brick
[17:48] <ryaxnb> look at the avatars or the art style.
[17:48] <stump> ugh "ninty" ugh
[17:48] <impiri> natal has a power brick?
[17:48] <Tiduz> i meanfrnata
[17:48] <ryaxnb> its oddly uncanny valleyish
[17:48] <Tiduz> yes
[17:48] <impiri> damn, i am out of outlets
[17:48] <Y2Kev> hm
[17:48] <Y2Kev> no Move in the miz game
[17:48] <Tiduz> if you use old 360
[17:48] <Luckett> what kev?
[17:48] <Tiduz> if you use new one it plugs into the new xbox
[17:48] * threivuzela has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[17:48] <Luckett> whattt
[17:48] <ryaxnb> whereas wii is just cute
[17:48] <Y2Kev> look at the press release
[17:48] <impiri> i need to buy either a new power strip or a new xbox
[17:48] <Y2Kev> it just mentions kinect
[17:49] <Luckett> uh....weird
[17:49] <Luckett> ps3 one still better then though
[17:49] <Joekage> Shoutouts to Hakan for the Gulf of Mexico disaster.
[17:49] <Joekage> Timedog out did himself with this one
[17:49] <Tiduz> If you like natal or move more just depends on personal taste
[17:49] <Luckett> or will the x360 one not be "KINECT ONLY"
[17:49] * jett has joined #ga
[17:49] <Luckett> god, such a clusterfuck
[17:49] <Tiduz> Natal has shit software but could get AWESOME games
[17:49] <jett> man
[17:49] <Tiduz> who knows
[17:49] <jett> fucking vuvuzelas
[17:49] <jett> fucking things
[17:49] <Y2Kev> no
[17:49] <Tiduz> jett
[17:49] <Tiduz> agreed
[17:49] <darkh23> kumbaya my lord.....
[17:50] <Y2Kev> it's 360, PS3 and 360 has kinect support
[17:50] <Tiduz> shotgun them please
[17:50] <jett> had to lock my dog in a room, he was getting unbearable
[17:50] * Tiduz shotguns darkh23
[17:50] <ryaxnb> Tiduz, what awesome games?
[17:50] <ryaxnb> golf simulators?
[17:50] <Tiduz> How would i know
[17:50] <Tiduz> i dont work for ms
[17:50] <ryaxnb> now thats nice,  but they could work on move too
[17:50] * Chemotose has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[17:50] <Tiduz> how shots golf move!
[17:50] <Tiduz> hot *
[17:50] <Luckett> ms barely has any 1st partys left
[17:50] <Unison_> 40% borders coupon
[17:50] <ryaxnb> i'm definetely more excited for the core potential of move.... its all about the buttons
[17:50] <Luckett> most of all kinect games have been outsourced
[17:50] <Mandoric> give natal to konami
[17:50] <darkh23> yeah  unison
[17:50] * Chemotose has joined #ga
[17:50] <Luckett> to devs that arent even being named
[17:50] <Mandoric> they know what to do with it
[17:50] <darkh23> I want to get the Home Movies box set
[17:50] <darkh23> lol
[17:50] <ryaxnb> look at the SOCOM or the fighting game demos.
[17:51] <Luckett> alongside the games theyve made
[17:51] <ryaxnb> those look sorta cool
[17:51] <Y2Kev> The Fight looks horrible
[17:51] <jett> if anything microsoft has shown that hardcore games will never work with kinect, not without a controller
[17:51] <Unison_> like what can natal do that move cant?
[17:51] <Mandoric> if they start porting arcade games i'll buy.
[17:51] <Unison_> seriously?
[17:51] <ryaxnb> looks meh.
[17:51] <Y2Kev> did MS show kinect games working with a controller?
[17:51] <ryaxnb> i could see it being a neat idea.
[17:51] <jett> y2kev: no
[17:51] <ryaxnb> Y2Kev, no.
[17:51] <Y2Kev> I'm wondering why not
[17:51] <Unison_> that would go against message
[17:51] <Unison_> obviously
[17:51] <jett> OBEY COCKLES
[17:51] <Luckett> YOU ARE THE CONTROLLER
[17:51] * Lone has joined #ga
[17:51] <ryaxnb> i mean, maybe The Fight isnt working great now, but the idea is there.
[17:51] <jett> the fight looks crap because it uses gesturing
[17:51] <jman2050> trackmania endurance courses can kiss my ass
[17:51] <darkh23> kinect will be a good head tracker for fps games
[17:51] <jman2050> argh
[17:52] <ryaxnb> i cant imagine a fighting game without buttons, but i could imagine one using gesturing.
[17:52] <Luckett> The Fight and The Shooter are The Trash of The Move lineup
[17:52] <ryaxnb> samne with Madden.
[17:52] <Unison_> i wonder if the real developers are shifting to new hardware yet
[17:52] <HitokagePC> darkh23: stop right there
[17:52] <Unison_> which is why we are getting waggle garbage
[17:52] * sp0rsk has joined #ga
[17:52] <HitokagePC> whatever good idea you may have for kinect
[17:52] <HitokagePC> won't happen
[17:52] <ryaxnb> darkh23, move can do headtracking to :)
[17:52] <Lone> wonder if any BRRRRRRRRRR's are happening in the world right now
[17:52] <HitokagePC> ;)
[17:52] <ryaxnb> little known fact darkh23 
[17:52] <sp0rsk> awww mannn
[17:52] <Unison_> haha hito
[17:52] <Luckett> unison: MS is paying out the ass to devs to get them to make shit
[17:52] <ryaxnb> move supports head, arm, and leg tracking
[17:52] <ryaxnb> not as good as kinect, but it does indeed support it.
[17:53] <Luckett> probably keeping some studios afloat with the payouts
[17:53] <sp0rsk> 3ds supports xbox 1 level graphisc apparently
[17:53] <Lone> so Kinect truly does cost as much as an XBox 360 arcade unit?
[17:53] <ryaxnb> sp0rsk, ive heard ps2 or gamecube level
[17:53] * threi-laptop has joined #ga
[17:53] <ryaxnb> Lone, most are saying $150
[17:53] <Joekage> 360 arcade is now $150
[17:53] <ryaxnb> arcade is currently $150 so yeahg
[17:53] <Joekage> so yes
[17:53] <Lone> Does it come with a 1 bottle of Liquid Gold?
[17:53] <Lone> pleasesayyes
[17:53] <Luckett> a nintendo piece of hardware ahead of the graphics curve....
[17:53] <sp0rsk> ryanxnb -- johntv says otherwise, and well im sure hes heard it from people who have not only seen it but have been working on it
[17:53] <Luckett> can it be done...
[17:53] <ryaxnb> sp0rsk, i disbelieve you
[17:54] <Joekage> No
[17:54] <ryaxnb> gamestop says $149
[17:54] <Joekage> It can't because Nintendo has the casual market by the balls
[17:54] <Y2Kev> sp0rsk: he says xbox 1?
[17:54] <ryaxnb> as does gamespot
[17:54] <sp0rsk> yeah
[17:54] <Y2Kev> so basically portable wii
[17:54] <sp0rsk> yup
[17:54] <Joekage> there's a reason nintendo succeeded where MS will fail
[17:54] <Joekage> Nintendo had an untapped market
[17:54] <Luckett> wii ports to portable...
[17:54] <ryaxnb> Y2Kev, wii is superior to xbox 1 :/
[17:54] <Y2Kev> wow, nintendo has the same hardware power across handheld and console
[17:54] <Lone> would portable wii come complete with wrist strap for the wii?
[17:54] * Tiktaalik has joined #ga
[17:54] <Luckett> not in some aspects ryaxnb
[17:54] <sp0rsk> where is everyone going to be streaming
[17:54] <ryaxnb> no hd support
[17:55] <ryaxnb> otherwise, its superior
[17:55] <Luckett> gametrailers was good for MS
[17:55] <Y2Kev> youtube was ahead of GT yesterday
[17:55] <sp0rsk> i think people underestimate the cost of kinect
[17:55] <Luckett> but then it died for the rest of the day
[17:55] <HitokagePC> Joekage: one could argue that Nintendo hadn't completely satisfied that market
[17:55] <sp0rsk> gamespot was the only decent place for ubisoft earlier
[17:55] <sp0rsk> i think if you bundled kinect with dance party lame time or whatever, it could be the next guitar hero
[17:55] <Joekage> Well when you look at how many Wii's have been sold, it's hard to argue but, you have a point
[17:55] <sp0rsk> outside of that game
[17:55] <Y2Kev> sp0rsk: you think 149 or more?
[17:55] <sp0rsk> i dont see shit
[17:56] <Somnia> move is 49.99, sub-controller is 29.99, twisted metal x = 2011 in gamestop system right now, but prices pending.
[17:56] <sp0rsk> i think 149 or more
[17:56] * Axord has joined #ga
[17:56] <Y2Kev> more than 149
[17:56] <Y2Kev> i just can't imagine that.
[17:56] <Kabouter> (16:55:02) sp0rsk: i think people underestimate the cost of kinect < What cost? Gaming industry crash?
[17:56] <Tiduz> thx Somnia
[17:56] <Joekage> But the people who werent satisfied with the Wii, won't be too Keen to spend $150 plus the cost of a 360 to experience the same thing in HD
[17:56] <Tiduz> When is it out btw
[17:56] <Tiduz> fall ?
[17:56] <sp0rsk> cost of the parts
[17:56] <ryaxnb> sp0rsk, $149
[17:56] <ryaxnb> thats the bottom line
[17:56] <sp0rsk> rgb camera is probably nothing
[17:56] <Somnia> doh
[17:56] <Somnia> forgot to ask tiduiz
[17:56] <sp0rsk> but theres a lot of advanced tech in there
[17:56] <Joekage> november tiduz
[17:56] <Tiduz> woops :P
[17:56] <Somnia> let me call my guy back
[17:56] <Y2Kev> i think it WAS $149
[17:56] <Tiduz> oh icic
[17:56] <Y2Kev> but i think MS is reconsidering
[17:56] <Y2Kev> or is struggling to price it
[17:57] <jman2050> <sp0rsk> but theres a lot of advanced tech in there
[17:57] <speedpop> if Kinect fails, it is going to hit Microsoft hard
[17:57] <ryaxnb> MS says more than $100
[17:57] <Y2Kev> and that's why they didn't announce it yesterday
[17:57] <Lone> oh shit, the Touchdown Jesus on the highway in Ohio got burned down?!
[17:57] <Acosta> that stuff is the next 32X
[17:57] <jman2050> your point being
[17:57] <Acosta> you will see
[17:57] <ryaxnb> Acosta, agreed
[17:57] <darkh23> kinect's cost is all R&D software shit....the piece of plastic with cameras isn't worth anything
[17:57] <ryaxnb> move is guaranteed to be suppoted by ALL sony first party titles and such
[17:57] <impiri> so the natal unit does all the face/voice/motion processing itself?
[17:57] <Unison_> so many sonytards in here
[17:57] <jman2050> oh nvm sprsk
[17:57] <jman2050> misread you
[17:57] <Tre`Kage> oh wow
[17:57] <ryaxnb> that give it more traction.
[17:57] <Acosta> the technology is very underwhelming and bulky
[17:57] <Somnia> Move in gamestop system has a tentative date for october
[17:57] <sp0rsk> its not just cameras dh
[17:57] <Unison_> pre-emptive strike against nintendo's awesomeness
[17:57] <impiri> i mean kinetic
[17:57] <impiri> I MEAN KINECT
[17:57] <darkh23> you think unison?
[17:57] <Tre`Kage> Each Track/Shoot/Questmania environment
[17:57] <Tre`Kage> will be sold separately
[17:57] <Y2Kev> Somnia: twisted metal X appeared?
[17:57] <Acosta> a 640x480 RGB camera
[17:57] <Unison_> yes
[17:57] <Acosta> come on
[17:57] <Somnia> yes Y2K
[17:57] <ryaxnb> Acosta, but kinect... is a 32X
[17:57] <Y2Kev> i hope it gets announced today...
[17:57] <threi-laptop> +1
[17:57] <Lone> damn, I was going to post in that Jesus burned by act of God topic
[17:57] <Somnia> but it has not been mentioned yet
[17:57] <Somnia> but its reservable
[17:57] <Y2Kev> i wonder if that's jaffes game
[17:57] <ryaxnb> Acosta, KINECT is a 32X.
[17:58] <jman2050> <ryaxnb> that give it more traction.
[17:58] <Somnia> so GameSTop knows its being announced lol
[17:58] <Y2Kev> oh
[17:58] <Y2Kev> lol
[17:58] <jman2050> not nearly enough
[17:58] <ryaxnb> jman2050, yes, it does.
[17:58] <Lone> I remember seeing that gigantic plaster jesus on a business trip :D
[17:58] <Tiduz> kevinbutler
[17:58] <Tiduz> <3
[17:58] <Y2Kev> are any PS2 collections?
[17:58] <Tiduz> Warning: don't wear flip flops to E3. SCEA will be dropping so much knowledge there, it may crush your toes.
[17:58] <Y2Kev> announced?
[17:58] <Somnia> rumros of Sly Cooper Collection
[17:58] <Somnia> rumors*
[17:58] <jman2050> again, not nearly enough
[17:58] <sp0rsk> im sad that i wotn be able tos tay up for sony
[17:58] <ryaxnb> jman2050, well, sony first-party is so big... it gives it lots of traction
[17:58] <sp0rsk> i  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally want to see last guardian
[17:58] <Y2Kev> yeah well
[17:58] <Acosta> I thank god for being a PC gamer
[17:58] <Y2Kev> Sly Cooper is confirmed
[17:58] <jman2050> but Move will always be marketed as a peripheral
[17:58] <ryaxnb> ive heard rumors theyre gonna pressure other games to support move
[17:58] <Y2Kev> also looks like patapon 3
[17:58] <Somnia> is it?!?!?
[17:58] <Somnia> fuck ya
[17:58] <Acosta> I don't have to suffer these conferences
[17:58] <jman2050> that's not enough to go against Nintendo
[17:58] <ryaxnb> i believe EA Sports is confirmed with move support.
[17:58] <Luckett> wonder if Ico + SOTC HD will make it to announcement
[17:58] <Y2Kev> Somnia: there's a banner on the show floor
[17:58] <jman2050> where the motion controller IS the Wii
[17:58] <Y2Kev> that says
[17:58] <Y2Kev> Sly colleciton
[17:59] <ryaxnb> jman2050, theyre not goinng against nintendo
[17:59] <Somnia> oh really? I missed that
[17:59] <Y2Kev> in 3D
[17:59] <Joekage> jman2050>	but Move will always be marketed as a peripheral
[17:59] <Somnia> awesomesauce
[17:59] <Acosta> I am just there for the lols and the rare cool stuff
[17:59] <ryaxnb> jman2050, theyre trying to convert the ps3 userbase to move.
[17:59] <sp0rsk> are there really that many people out there who like sly
[17:59] <Somnia> 49.99 for the move controller is not bad
[17:59] <ryaxnb> Joekage, no
[17:59] <Somnia> sub controller needs to drop to 19.99 though
[17:59] <Y2Kev> yeah i already have EyeToy
[17:59] <Somnia> or 24.99
[17:59] <Tiduz> I never played sly
[17:59] <jman2050> if they're not going against Nintendo, then there's no point to what they're doing
[17:59] <Tiduz> i did love infamous
[17:59] <Y2Kev> so i just need to spend 70 then
[17:59] <ryaxnb> Joekage, new sonys will come bundled with move.
[17:59] <Acosta> feel a bit excited for 3ds, have hopes with that
[17:59] <Y2Kev> to get everything
[17:59] <jman2050> everything Sony and MS has been doing to this point
[17:59] <Somnia> ya not bad at all
[17:59] <Joekage> they will?
[17:59] <jman2050> has been to attack Nintendo
[17:59] <Acosta> hope they show f-zero or pilotwings, it would make sense
[17:59] <ryaxnb> Joekage, just a guess.
[17:59] <Unison_> move and natal will both flop
[17:59] <jman2050> it's plain as day
[17:59] <Joekage> Nintendo is laughing to the bank
[17:59] <jman2050> not really open for debate
[17:59] <ryaxnb> if EVERY first party game will support or require move, why not?
[17:59] <Unison_> i wonder why they bother
[17:59] <Somnia> we'll see unison
[17:59] <Acosta> Unison_ absolutely
[17:59] * ghst_ has joined #ga
[18:00] <ryaxnb> and the first part is confirmed
[18:00] * ghst_ is now known as ghst_craptop
[18:00] <sp0rsk> i have a feeling nintendo is about to juke the rest of hte industry with the 3ds
[18:00] <ryaxnb> so youd think they'd want new customers to be able to play the first party sony games.
[18:00] <ryaxnb> right?
[18:00] <Acosta> why?
[18:00] <sp0rsk> wooo officially 1 hour left
[18:00] <Somnia> Unison you missed the live bombast btw! it was fucking hilarious seeing Jeff snap a few times
[18:00] <Somnia> lol
[18:00] <Unison_> seems so sporsk
[18:00] <Unison_> i am watching it now
[18:00] <Unison_> haha
[18:00] <stump> oh man, child of eden is a retail game
[18:00] <stump> what the fuck
[18:00] <stump> that's such a terrible idea
[18:00] <Tiduz> wat
[18:00] <Tiduz> u serious
[18:00] <jman2050> <ryaxnb> so youd think they'd want new customers to be able to play the first party sony games.
[18:00] <Tiduz> $15 psn or bust
[18:00] <jman2050> <ryaxnb> jman2050, theyre trying to convert the ps3 userbase to move.
[18:00] <Unison_> lol stump
[18:00] <jman2050> whoops
[18:00] <Somnia> Child of Eden supports regular controllers = bought
[18:00] <stump> "Scheduled for a Q1 2011 release on the Xbox 360 ¬Æ video game and entertainment system from Microsoft and for the PlayStation ¬Æ 3 computer entertainment system"
[18:01] <sp0rsk> i want children of eden with a normal controller and 3d
[18:01] <Tiduz> but
[18:01] <Somnia> stump: He did say they had not decided yet on retail or regular
[18:01] <Luckett> "yay, standard controller support!" this is depressing
[18:01] * SantaC has joined #ga
[18:01] <Tiduz> by 2011 well all be dead!
[18:01] <SantaC> zeeeeeeeeruda
[18:01] <Acosta> I just want a normal controller
[18:01] <Acosta> if I want to feel the colores I will take acid while playing
[18:01] <sp0rsk> im tellin you guys, miz did this 3d genki rockets concert with this huge 3d screen
[18:01] <Joekage> Move will fail because it's a peripheral and they never really fall into any other category but mediocre sales, gimmick shit. Kinect will fail because MS is trying to copy Nintendo at a higher price point catering to people who are cheap and will buy the shittiest games as long as it doesn't break the bank... which is the Wii audience
[18:01] <Acosta> 4D bitches!
[18:01] <Lone> http://ht.cdn.turner.com/si/images/2010/06/14/colorado.pdf    HAHAHA
[18:01] <sp0rsk> it fucking blew my mind
[18:02] <Luckett> your mind is easily blown
[18:02] <ryaxnb> Joekage, move is more than a peripheral
[18:02] <dramatis> Child of Eden isn't coming until Q1 2011?
[18:02] <sp0rsk> shit was just assaulting your senses
[18:02] <ryaxnb> it  is the future of the PS3
[18:02] <Joekage> lol
[18:02] <darkh23> did I just step into a press release
[18:02] <jman2050> a belated future
[18:02] <ryaxnb> sony is pushing as hard as they legally can for all new PS3 games to have some move support.
[18:02] <sp0rsk> when are you junkies unlocking the nintendo conference thread
[18:02] <jman2050> and in the end it won't matter
[18:02] <jman2050> because it won't have the traction the Wii has
[18:02] <ryaxnb> this includes all first parties and all EA Sports titles
[18:02] <ryaxnb> jman2050, ITS NOT THE WII
[18:02] <jman2050> and as long as the Wii continues to dominate, their efforts are futile
[18:02] <jman2050> plain and simple
[18:02] <Joekage> I'm pretty sure Sony did the same thing with the Eyetoy
[18:03] <ryaxnb> its about converting the PS3 userbase and expanding.
[18:03] <jman2050> but Move's success is intrinsically linked to the Wii's success
[18:03] <Joekage> As long as the Wii is cheap
[18:03] <jman2050> that's what I'm trying to say!
[18:03] <ryaxnb> Its about Wii HD.
[18:03] <Somnia> Move doesnt have to sell to EVERY current owner, but if it can even sell to 50% itll be a huge success on top of every system being bundled with it starting in the holiday period
[18:03] <Y2Kev> I was sitting in my room with my male pre-teen 18-49 mom when Felicia took her sweater off and my mom went nuts! She said we must have it no matter what the cost! 
[18:03] <Joekage> Sony isn't going to convert the fanbase
[18:03] <jman2050> they're trying to expand their audience to what end?
[18:03] <Y2Kev> WE MUST HAVE KINECT
[18:03] <Joekage> You're crazy if you thik that's their main goal.
[18:03] <Joekage> think*
[18:03] <jman2050> their main goal is to beat Nintendo
[18:03] <threi-laptop> Ivory coast stepping it up
[18:03] <jman2050> same as MS
[18:03] <threi-laptop> good shit
[18:03] <jman2050> any other reason is BSing
[18:03] <sp0rsk> is drogba gonna show pu for this game
[18:04] <sp0rsk> or is he still on tulio time
[18:04] <Tiduz> their main goal
[18:04] <Acosta> threi-laptom, is there any stream?
[18:04] <Tiduz> is making money
[18:04] <Joekage> Move is just a gimmick to make it seem as if they're tryign to counter Microsoft's Kinect platform to potential consumers
[18:04] <threi-laptop> im watching it on tv
[18:04] <Somnia> Except theyve planned some form of motion since 2001
[18:04] <threi-laptop> try cbc canada
[18:04] <Somnia> granted they didnt do it till now
[18:04] <Somnia> but still
[18:04] <Tiduz> did you see the move prototype shit ?
[18:04] <Joekage> People are stupid enough to be like. Oh hey MS has Kinect, what does Sony have for me.. Move is for those people
[18:04] <darkh23> aahahaha
[18:04] <Luckett> sixaxis was motion
[18:04] <darkh23> this is all too hilarious
[18:04] <Acosta> thanks, it's PPV here
[18:04] <Luckett> sixaxis forgotten forever...
[18:05] <Joekage> Sixaxis was the same thing
[18:05] <Joekage> Oh hey, Nintendo has a waggle controller thing
[18:05] <impiri> whoa
[18:05] <jman2050> and I think both of them will fail to beat Nintendo
[18:05] <jman2050> because both companies, based on their marketing
[18:05] <Somnia> Dr. Marks has had prototype motion controllers dated back to 2001 in his office/work area. They just havent done them till now (because they see its successful now)
[18:05] <threi-laptop> oh the days when sixaxis was "the perfect compromise between traditional and motion control"
[18:05] <jman2050> completely misunderstood what made the Wii successful
[18:05] * Lo-Volt has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[18:05] <Joekage> lets make a sixaxis and act like we're kinda similar so people will buy our product
[18:05] * Newduck has joined #ga
[18:05] <Luckett> i think Nintendo has a big problem with following up the Wii
[18:05] <darkh23> threi those were the days when rumble was obsolete
[18:05] <jman2050> that's another matter Luckett, and a relevant one at that
[18:05] <speedpop> who says there
[18:05] <darkh23> ah those were teh days
[18:05] <Somnia> and dr. marks had nothing to do with sixaxis so I give him a pass lol
[18:05] <speedpop> there's a follow-up?
[18:05] <jman2050> we'll see what they have up their sleeves
[18:06] <sp0rsk> nintendo doesnt follow up the wii, they jsut do something else, lol
[18:06] <speedpop> seems likely that all 3 manufacturers are content at the current consoles for another few years yet
[18:06] <jett> Wii Hi-Fi, believe
[18:06] <Somnia> 2014 will be new systems
[18:06] <threi-laptop> nintendo will follow ubisoft's lead
[18:06] <Somnia> its gonna be awhile
[18:06] <threi-laptop> and make laser tag
[18:06] <sp0rsk> dude what was up with that laser tag
[18:06] <jman2050> the worst thing that can happen for MS and Sony is for Nintendo to introduce and standardize something else
[18:06] <jman2050> and undercut Move and Kinect before they're off the ground
[18:06] <sp0rsk> like as fucking stupid as i thought it was for them to show that off
[18:06] <Acosta> "we are sorry, the video you have selected cannot be streamed outside Canada"
[18:06] <sp0rsk> .........i fucking love laser tag
[18:06] <Unison_> lol @ you sonytards going to war over motion controls
[18:06] <Unison_> all self respect lost
[18:06] <threi-laptop> this ref is killing me
[18:06] <threi-laptop> lol
[18:06] <Acosta> I am going to kill the guy who made regional borders in the fucking internet
[18:07] <jman2050> The Wii's success had about 25% to do with the motion controls themselves
[18:07] <Somnia> I've liked move since day 1 so its whatever for me unison =P
[18:07] <jman2050> Sony and MS took that 25% and extrapolated it as their primary focus
[18:07] <jman2050> that's the main problem
[18:07] <Somnia> I've also liked Wii's controls with select games
[18:07] <Somnia> like Zack and Wiki!
[18:07] <sp0rsk> i think nintendo.jp is going to haeve a live stream
[18:07] <impiri> Wii's success had to do with WII BOWLING
[18:07] <Tiduz> lol@ Unison commenting for +N cred

[18:08] <jman2050> Wii Sports legitimized motion controls 5 years ago
[18:08] <Luckett> ehhhhhhhh
[18:08] <Tiduz> ''Abby Sunderland: The Female 'Balloon Boy'?''
[18:08] <Luckett> Motion+
[18:08] <jman2050> the fact that devs at large have been pitiful on following up on that is not all that relevent
[18:08] * jettjett has joined #ga
[18:08] <Somnia> Not enough games use Motion+
[18:08] <Somnia> its like people forgot about it
[18:08] <jman2050> Luckett: Motion+ refined them
[18:08] * jett has quit IRC (Quit: )
[18:08] <impiri> wii bowling and tennis were fun new things that you could learn in literally ten seconds, and that got the system's foot in the door
[18:08] <Tiduz> i regret buying motion +
[18:08] <sp0rsk> its all ubisofts fault
[18:08] * jettjett is now known as jett
[18:08] <Tiduz> like 4 games use it wtf
[18:08] <sp0rsk> they fucking muddied the water
[18:08] <jman2050> and people still aren't following up
[18:08] <Somnia> yet motion+ has sold a ton
[18:08] <Somnia> yet people arent using it
[18:09] <Luckett> i got motion+ with my black wii B)
[18:09] <Tiduz> Zelda better be motion +
[18:09] <stump> it is
[18:09] <Somnia> conduit 2 is
[18:09] <Tiduz> good
[18:09] <jman2050> Somnia: they are using it silly

[18:09] <Somnia> lulz
[18:09] <jman2050> for WSR
[18:09] <darkh23> the notion that sony would be doing Move regardless of Wii because they've been planning it since 2001 is just totally hilarious to me
[18:09] <stump> Tiduz: wait, you bought m+ as opposed to buying wsr or red steel 2?
[18:09] <duckroll> Zelda better look FUN
[18:09] <Somnia> haha true jman
[18:09] <Tiduz> then i fogive them
[18:09] <jman2050> duh
[18:09] <jett> trying out xchat
[18:09] <duckroll> i don't care what it supports
[18:09] <Tiduz> Yes stump
[18:09] <jett> i don't like this!

[18:09] <Mandoric> \stump: you can't torrent motion+ and put it on a hard drive
[18:09] <Tiduz> i think it was 20 bux ?
[18:09] <Luckett> hey listen in sword form
[18:09] <Mandoric> of COURSE it's the one he bought
[18:09] <threi-laptop> and did you dl the demo or the free version

[18:10] * Newduck has joined #ga
[18:10] <dramatis> I'm more curious about how they are going to apply the tech they're doing with Move and Kinect outside of games
[18:10] <Y2Kev> Xbox, go to slide 5
[18:10] <threi-laptop> use pidgin then
[18:10] <dramatis> there was already an article posted on Znet about using Kinect for business presentations
[18:10] <Somnia> "CEO Bobby Kotick added: ìThe Call of Duty franchise has re"
[18:10] <jett> yeah i was using pidgin, but it keeps fucking up
[18:11] <Somnia> hence the 6million party
[18:11] <jett> the scroll bar gets stuck
[18:11] <Somnia> doh cut off

[18:11] <Somnia> jesus
[18:11] <threi-laptop> there are 2 versions
[18:11] <threi-laptop> one of them is a trial
[18:12] <Mandoric> that 55m number is interesting
[18:12] <jett> it doesn't say it's a trial
[18:12] <dramatis> it's a trial
[18:12] <Somnia> that 55m isnt right I dont think

[18:14] <jman2050> <Mandoric> that 55m number is interesting
[18:14] <threi-laptop> you can't really get much for it though
[18:14] <jman2050> even if they take out Japan it doesn't make sense
[18:14] <Joekage> now that it's announced  gamestop is gonna cut the buy back value of the 360 hardcore now
[18:14] <threi-laptop> certain months eb games gives trade bonuses
[18:14] <Lo-Volt> Bam.
[18:14] <Mandoric> jman: i may be reading too much into it
[18:14] <Joekage> They already lowered the price of the arcade and elite
[18:14] <Mandoric> but it looks like activision's estimate of how many people own both
[18:14] <jman2050> ah
[18:15] <Mandoric> well, derived from that estimate
[18:15] <mintywork> i think you might still be able to get 100 bones
[18:15] <Unison_> that gametrailers streaming is excellent
[18:15] <Unison_> really nice
[18:15] <Unison_> best e3 streaming to date
[18:15] <Lo-Volt> Indeed.
[18:15] <mintywork> gamestop is doing that extra 25 bones trade in deal
[18:15] <darkh23> yes
[18:16] <Somnia> hm
[18:16] <Somnia> want me to see if trade-in values dropped on 360?
[18:16] <mintywork> so you better get your butt over there
[18:16] <Lo-Volt> Meaning what, exactly? $25 on top of whatever old thing you're trading in if you buy a new console?
[18:16] <Somnia> 25 bonus on any next gen system
[18:16] <Lo-Volt> Ah.
[18:16] <Somnia> psp, ds, 360, ps3, wii but no psp go

[18:18] <Somnia> but we'll see
[18:18] <Joekage> With a trade in deal
[18:18] <Unison_> yeah if they would let you transfer it in-store
[18:18] <Lo-Volt> If they do a promo this weekend, I might visit a GameStop.
[18:18] <Unison_> that would be good

[18:18] <Unison_> i'd do that 
[18:18] <Lo-Volt> I would too.
[18:18] <Unison_> my 360 works but it is so loud

[18:51] <Luckett> green and purple, riddlers and jokers
[18:51] <Lo-Volt> Apparently, the Kinect device is 'huge.'
[18:51] <Mandoric> i actually kinda like it. it doesn't go well with green at all and it'll look terrible on the shelf next to 360 cases, but standing alone it's fine
[18:51] <Luckett> it is

[19:11] <ryaxnb> it looks alright.
[19:11] <FirewalkR> CUT WHAT YOU WILL
[19:11] <ryaxnb> the lag is probably the big screen
[19:11] <Yamauchi> yuck
[19:11] <Narayan> GET RID OF THE STIFF MOTION.
[19:11] <ryaxnb> the big hdtv... :(
[19:11] <Acosta> I still like how it looks

[19:11] <Vic> ryaxnb: ARE ARE ARE

[19:12] <Tiduz> half the sword swings dont work ?
[19:12] <the_abominable_snowman> delay doesnt make it fail. the fact that he raised the wiimote and link did a 360 spin did
[19:12] <Crz> running on dolphin lol
[19:12] <Narayan> That tasted good!
[19:12] <Sykra> animation looks really bad
[19:12] <MrPing1000> The controls are probably fine, miyamoto is just shit lol

[19:12] <Narayan> 1:1 = Not good.
[19:12] <Acosta> he is just doing rndom movements at air
[19:12] <ryaxnb> looks bvetter now.
[19:12] <jett> nintendo should port this to the ps3 move
[19:12] <HK-47> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[19:12] <AdamF> i like hwo everyone is bitching at the game and its on a 3 inch screen

[19:12] <the_abominable_snowman> hes swinging wildly and link is waving his sword like he has a limp wrist
[19:12] <Tre`> Haha wes
[19:12] <sp0rsk> if the controls are the wii sports resorts controls there wont be a problem
[19:12] <Lo-Volt> Yeah, this is trash.

[19:12] <sp0rsk> its just miyamoto suscks or something
[19:12] <Narayan> They better have an option to make him left-handed.
[19:12] <Yamauchi> pretty cheesy, not as bad as Snake cutting a van in half with a sword, but still not great
[19:12] <Luckett> i cant believe how generic it looks

[19:20] <Amir0x> Like every Nintendo fan said
[19:20] <Kabouter> Jumped in the middle of this, is this Zelda game for 3DS or Wii? (no troll)
[19:20] <MrPing1000> if they just showed the trailer instead of miyamoto messing around we'd all love it lol
[19:20] <Luckett> a less good looking wind waker?
[19:20] <Amir0x> "IWATA SAID IT'S THIS YEAR"
[19:20] <Somnia> It looks like a decent zelda game, but the controls HAVE TO WORK...I hope it was just interference
[19:20] <Acosta> wii
[19:20] <Kabouter> Thx

[20:04] <HK-47> GAF is dead
[20:04] <ShoNuff> not playable
[20:04] <stump> it looks a little higher than psp, comparing CC:FF7 shots to kid icarus there.
[20:04] <Amir0x> I know the difference between graphics and which are better
[20:04] <Acosta> well it≈õ a upgrade, the sooner they get rid of ds shittty 3d games, the better
[20:04] <threi-laptop> its about 25 thousand times better than GOW PSP

[20:04] <bluemaxmini> as a psp developer
[20:04] <mintywork> you ain't buying nintedy sytems for gfx
[20:04] <jett> it's probably higher res than psp
[20:04] <Yamauchi> PSP fags are funny

[20:10] <GaimeGuy> even if icarus didn't look  like 360 power or whatever
[20:10] <Wes_> 3DS > PS3
[20:10] <MrPing1000> I'd bang her
[20:10] <ShoNuff> hey baby
[20:10] <GaimeGuy> imagine it with 3d effects
[20:10] <Kabouter> The Saints Row thing I'm assuming bluemaxmini?
[20:10] <mintywork> dang keiji looks like a caveman
[20:10] <HK-47> Threi: Zelda disappointmentton

[20:10] <ryaxnb> other than zelda interference
[20:10] <jman2050> ANimal: I wish they could
[20:10] <Luckett> zelda was the worst part of the conference XD
[20:10] <Unison_> saints row = shoot sewage at houses in 3D!
[20:10] <KTallguy> but it's nice that there are no glasses
[20:10] <HK-47> JACKSON
[20:10] <bluemaxmini> i bet a million monopoly dollars
[20:10] <milh31> but you are wearing glass
[20:10] <SSFKyori4> oh man.
[20:10] <GaimeGuy> then you will see why  people were saying "holy shit"
[20:10] <Luckett> what a weird case
[20:10] <DeezNutz> JIZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
[20:10] <ShoNuff> Saints row bastards
[20:10] <bluemaxmini> that saints row 3ds
[20:11] <SSFKyori4> mgs 3ds
[20:11] <BudokaiMR2> GAF WONT MOVE AND I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPNEED 
[20:11] <DeezNutz> MGS3DS
[20:11] <bluemaxmini> is the same game
[20:11] <GaimeGuy> mil:  no you are not
[20:11] <KTallguy> mgs though wow
[20:11] <bluemaxmini> we were making
[20:11] <Gattsu25> 3DS looks nice, would have hoped for better graphics than PSP but oh well.  I guess it is rendering each image twice.  None of the games really stood out, though.  Zelda has a nice art style.  Meh.  Outside of 3DS, what a waste of a lunchbreak
[20:11] <bluemaxmini> for psp
[20:11] <KTallguy> that's a coup
[20:11] <Rorschach> mgs3d

[20:11] <BudokaiMR2> NOWAYNOWAY
[20:11] <Kabouter> (19:10:25) Wes_: 3DS > PS3 < Meh, if they do a ‚Ç¨250 PS3 slim bundle with GT5, I'm there. Can't see anything that would sell me on 3DS.
[20:11] <SSFKyori4> RE sounds hot

[20:11] <ryaxnb> Gattsu25, not even Kirby?
[20:11] <mintywork> i just want to see some new kirby pix and footages
[20:11] <milh31> re4 3ds super edition exclsuive
[20:11] <Tiktaalik> im glad the graphics aren't too good. It'll encourage people to keep making pixel art games
[20:11] <DeezNutz> JESUS CHRIST THIS IS GODLY

[20:35] <GaimeGuy> slugg:   yes
[20:35] <TheNatural> The 3D effect doesn‚Äôt feel to me to be one of things popping out of the screen, but of depth behind the screen. Things certainly seemed to protrude a bit depending on how you looked and what the scene was, but by and large it felt like the 3D screen was a sort of window into a room, inside which everything was 3D. The 3D effect certainly is real, though.

[20:45] <Tim_the_Wiz> luigi's mansion?
[20:45] <jett> ssf4 looks really ugly compared to top tier Ps2 fighters
[20:45] <impiri> 3DS has a fantastic list of games... i am impressed
[20:45] <GaimeGuy> they're talking about initial concept work where they created a 3d version of luigi's mansion
[20:45] <milh31> i'm no source i just went straight to nintendo press site username is guest and password is nintendo http://press.nintendo.com/E32010/index.html
[20:45] <TheNatural> i liked that game, it was short but nice
[20:45] <java966> 3ds bullshots almost look xbox1 quality, esp the resident evil screens

[20:46] <HitokagePC> meh
[20:46] <threi-laptop> nvidia tegra
[20:46] <HitokagePC> ssf4 better not have a truncated character set
[20:46] <squarepeg> any speculation on 3ds price?
[20:46] <GaimeGuy> $5999
[20:46] <Tiduz> 599
[20:46] <Vic> olubode: finally, the specs
[20:46] <milh31> with 800x240 pixel resolution (400 pixels are allocated for each eye to 
[20:46] <milh31> enable 3D viewing)
[20:46] <Luckett> that MGS3 stuff looks like Peace Walker assets
[20:46] <Luckett> edited
[20:47] <SSFKyori4> Hitokage: can be like iphone. lol add chars via dlc
[20:47] <TheNatural> so microsoft shows off the casual waving arms crazy shit and nintendo breaks out a lineup of classic game franchises with barely anything casual ... the irony
[20:47] <Tiduz> imma get blue ds i think
[20:47] <threi-laptop> hmm
[20:47] <Kabouter> $149 + $29,95 monthly subscription
[20:47] <threi-laptop> so basically
[20:47] <jett> snake eater 3DS pics might be real, i'm not sure. snake looks slightly different than in MGS3 PS2
[20:47] <threi-laptop> it will look bad in screens
[20:47] <Tiduz> jett
[20:47] <Tiduz> linkage?
[20:47] <alr1ght> http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/4/2010/06/3dscreen.jpg
[20:47] <Luckett> its peace walker stuff jet, done for MGS3 peoples
[20:47] <jett> it definitely looks sub-ps2
[20:47] <milh31> One inner camera and two outer cameras with 640x480 (0.3 Mega) pixel resolution.
[20:47] <HitokagePC> 400x240?
[20:47] <phil> anyone else disappointed they didn't show the vitality sensor? ;)
[20:47] <stump> jett: what do you mean "might be real"?
[20:47] <olubode> I wonder how quickly Sony can scramble.

[20:47] <jman2050> Jeremy Parish:3DS is the real deal. Even my janky-ass eyes can visualize it. PSP-level graphics in 3D. I am seriously impressed.
[20:47] <jman2050> yikes
[20:48] <Lovingsteam> best conference i have ever seen
[20:48] <jett> stump:  I don't know if they are real 3DS pictures or jsut PS2 pictures

[20:48] <Tiduz> only wii and move for me
[20:48] <Kabouter> You clearly didn't see that Ubisoft conference last year Lovingsteam
[20:48] <threi-laptop> when is sony conference
[20:48] <EviLore> <HitokagePC> 400x240?  <----so lower effective res than PSP screen
[20:48] <Tiduz> kinect is extremely do not want
[20:48] <Kabouter> Or was it two years ago?
[20:48] <TheNatural> fuck man .. 2D games and classic franchises ... i might have to get back into games again soon
[20:48] <Lovingsteam> lol Kabouter, I did
[20:48] <Jide> 1 hour and 10 minutes
[20:48] <Kabouter> THAT was the best conference ever
[20:48] <Kabouter> It was GLORIOUS
[20:48] <HitokagePC> EviLore: 15 fucking years and just now they match SNES resolution

[20:49] <TheNatural> not bad
[20:49] <Kabouter> No Jide, 40 minutes. Brazil - North Korea starts at 20:30 CET.
[20:49] <jett> stump: pictures are 410 pixels wide, for what it's worth
[20:49] <Kabouter> Not 21:00
[20:49] <java966> thank god for cards on portables, f umd
[20:49] <Mandoric> 2GB max
[20:49] <Mandoric> so
[20:49] <Jide> kabouter someone wa sasking about the sony conference
[20:49] <Mandoric> 'bigger than UMD' lol
[20:49] <vulva> just need a price now
[20:49] <Kabouter> Yeah, but they should be watching Brazil - North Korea instead
[20:49] <jett> they also seem pixel accurate
[20:49] <Kabouter> Because Sony sucks nuts, and that game won't
[20:49] <TheNatural> UMD isnt even 2GB?
[20:49] <HitokagePC> lulz easy to pirate
[20:49] <Mandoric> sony's still bothering?

[20:50] <olubode> 2.4mhz
[20:50] <olubode> so dual band n is out of the question
[20:50] <stump> the 3ds resolution is going to be weird; 800x240 for the top screen, presumably 256x192 for the bottom screen
[20:50] <HK-47> What about Star Fox?
[20:50] <Vic> Shin Megami Tensei: Persona
[20:50] <MrPing1000> use the bottom screen for maps and menus n shit
[20:50] <jett> stump: yeah...i wonder what kind of quality will be the bottom screen has
[20:50] <Vic> Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor
[20:50] <MrPing1000> have all the action on the 3d screen
[20:50] <HadesGigas> "Star Fox 64 3D" is listed on the pdf
[20:50] <jett> if it's some regular DS shit...i hope not
[20:50] <Vic> both for the 3DS
[20:50] <mrsolo> brazil game has it started?
[20:51] <TheNatural> bottom screen will be usual meh stuff .. nintendo really didnt even have to include a 2nd screen really, except for ds games it seems like

[21:15] <phil> I think the artstyle works really well for the wii
[21:15] <David> Rag: Wasn't that implied from waht I said? :)
[21:15] <Luckett> imagine Wind Waker on 3DS
[21:15] <bluemaxwork> gaime dont hate

[21:16] <David> Oh, come on now... Star Fox 64 3d? That better be Nintendo's only cheap cashin port.
[21:17] <EGM92> now the bitch won't send it cause it's too heavy to ship out
[21:17] * DeezNutz has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[21:17] <David> Unless they rerelease Warioland VB
[21:17] <Rotanibor> i assume starfox will be downloadable
[21:17] <TheNatural> star fox is worth it
[21:17] <EGM92> and costs too much though we agreed on a fucking price
[21:17] <stump> David: if you look at the actual list of stuff you will see which games are cashin ports and which games are new games

[21:17] <EGM92> worthless POS
[21:17] <Bob_Coffee> David: its not like nintendo could do anything to add to starfox, starfox64 is already perfection.
[21:17] <Luckett> i dont get what kojima is making
[21:17] <David> Stump: I'm looking at the list. I've only seen MGS and Starfox 64 easily identified as ports
[21:17] <bluemaxwork> everything that is an existing franchise
[21:17] <Luckett> MGS3 remake?
[21:17] <bluemaxwork> is a cash in port
[21:17] <frankie_baby> anyone got the address for the press site, i've lost it
[21:17] <David> Bob: New levels, same gameplay. Easy.
[21:17] <vulva> ...
[21:17] <mac> isn't kojima retired?
[21:17] <HK-47> Luckett: New Zelda Bros Wii would be better than Zelda Wii's demo
[21:17] <SSFKyori4> roofl i just realized
[21:18] <Luckett> side scrolling Zelda again would have been cool
[21:18] <SSFKyori4> no xenoblade announcement. or last story?
[21:18] * EGM92 slaps mac around a bit with a large trout
[21:18] <GaimeGuy> david,  they have announced Animal Crossing, Kid Icarus: Uprising, mario Kart, Nintendogs + Cats, Paper Mario, PilotWings Resort, StarFox 64 3D, Steel Diver
[21:18] <mac> he's letting the new gen make his game
[21:18] <stump> SSFKyori4: No.
[21:18] <Luckett> since thats the memo Nintendo devs have been given
[21:18] <Bob_Coffee> i just hope ssf4 port to 3d is good.
[21:18] * ElyrionX has joined #ga

[21:18] <RagnarokX> man that looks nice
[21:18] <David> Gaime: Yah. I just assumed that Starfox is the only port
[21:18] <Luckett> Kirby and Donkey Kong both
[21:18] <GaimeGuy> but the only game that looks like a port is star fox
[21:18] <TheNatural> so .. no GBA port on this thing?
[21:18] <SSFKyori4> stump: yah just saying youd think there would have been a mention at least
[21:18] <Tiduz> did you see the screens Bob_Coffee
[21:18] <GaimeGuy> nope, natural
[21:18] <Alone> the fuck? cel shaded?
[21:18] <SSFKyori4> either its later .. or its no coming lawlz
[21:18] <Tiduz> looked a bit weird
[21:18] <TheNatural> ah
[21:18] <David> Yep.
[21:18] <threi> yes
[21:18] <EGM92> what the fuck does the 3ds look like?!
[21:18] <GaimeGuy> and the 2nd screen is almost certainly only there for DS compatibility
[21:18] <David> Wind Waker / Twilight Princess mix
[21:18] <EGM92> gaf is crapping out on me
[21:18] <threi> cell shaded, no chibi
[21:18] <Bob_Coffee> Tiduz:yea, hope it looks better in motion.
[21:18] <Tre`Magic> mmmm
[21:18] <mac> haha, gaf 500'ed
[21:18] <Tiduz> EGM92
[21:18] <HitokagePC> ASSHOLES VS COMMUNISTS

[21:18] <Tre`Magic> Duels of the Planeswalker
[21:19] <Tre`Magic> good shit
[21:19] <HitokagePC> LET'S GO
[21:19] <phil> do you guys think all of retro is working on a 2.5d DK?   doesnt look like something that should take up so much manpower
[21:19] <Tiduz> dsi with a widescreen topscreen basically
[21:19] <stump> SSFKyori4: it's unfortunate, TLS i'm not surprised because it'll be 2011 in japan, but xenoblade is out now in japan so you'd figure it'd be confirmed for the ds
[21:19] <TheNatural> pretty much .. they could have probably removed it and called it Game Boy 3D
[21:19] <RagnarokX> wind waker style > TP style
[21:19] <Tre`Magic> AI gets a few too many good cards but hey
[21:19] <Tiduz> 80% the same
[21:19] <threi> and now because of the presentation they have the controls to bitch about
[21:19] <Tiduz> analog stick added
[21:19] <EGM92> wtf tiduz
[21:19] <stump> but it still has a touch screen :p
[21:19] <Tiduz> and a slider for 3d
[21:19] <syllogism> http://img.waffleimages.com/3e4a22b7d14c036fbd59cf5c2e9e1b1573ae0c22/3DS_PaperMario_04ss04_E3.png
[21:19] <David> Analog "slide" they called it.
[21:19] <bluemaxwork> kim jong il
[21:19] <EGM92> slider?
[21:19] <EGM92> ...
[21:19] <Tiduz> and a telecopic pen
[21:19] <bluemaxwork> communicates to the coach of north kroea
[21:19] <bluemaxwork> korea
[21:19] <bluemaxwork> telepathically
[21:19] <stump> EGM92: you can tone down or up the 3d effect
[21:19] <Tiduz> you can adjust intensity of 3d
[21:19] <bluemaxwork> awesome
[21:19] <Tiduz> or turn it off

[21:24] <David> SSF: Majora
[21:24] <Narayan> Seeing the MGS3DS screens makes me wonder if its more powerful than the PS2.

[21:25] <Luckett> the 3d effects are probably whats keeping it just behind PS2
[21:25] <mac> It looks like nintendo is stepping up in the hardware game
[21:25] <Rotanibor> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=398373
[21:25] <David> Is it too  much to hope for a reasonable price for the 3DS?
[21:25] <bufbaf> thx
[21:25] <SSFKyori4> Sea_Manky: yet im curious what corners nintendo cut this time around
[21:25] <Rotanibor> MARIO KART 3DS
[21:25] <azentium> naked sample makes me worried that the snake eater port is only a demo
[21:25] <Lone> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[21:25] <Sea_Manky> All of them, same as always
[21:25] <mac>  <syllogism> looks better than the wii game really  <--- See, I'm not crazy
[21:25] <HandsomeHomeless> yeah 3DS looks PSP
[21:25] <Wes_BRRRRRRRAZIL> This is goign to be a massacre.
[21:25] <Rotanibor> mario kart 3ds looks really good
[21:25] <SSFKyori4> azentium: well it says sample.
[21:25] <Vic> Rotanibor: Any pics for Mario kart
[21:25] <HandsomeHomeless> maybe cleaner textures, but still relatively simple
[21:25] <bluemaxwork> only shot of mgs 3ds that looks familiar
[21:25] <Rotanibor> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=398373
[21:25] <bluemaxwork> is him fighting the boss
[21:25] <Rotanibor> that thread vic
[21:25] <SSFKyori4> so im taking it as a tech demo that kojima is toying with
[21:25] <Road> I won't be surprised if it is more powerful than the PS2, though. Remember these are 1st gen games.
[21:25] <Vic> thanks rotan
[21:25] <Alone> not happy that 3ds = psp
[21:25] <David> I can't get NeoGaf to load.

[21:25] <HandsomeHomeless> it's not more powerful than the ps3.
[21:26] <HandsomeHomeless> ps2.
[21:26] <Alone> maybe with the smaller screen it;ll look better
[21:26] <SSFKyori4> whats a given tho. kojima loves new tech so hes def gonna be doing something with it
[21:26] <HandsomeHomeless> you can tell that immediately
[21:26] <mac> quit linking gaf, it's down
[21:26] <Sea_Manky> I do want to see the 3DS when the demo units are in stores, simply because it'll be cheaper than an IMAX ticket to test and see if this 3D shit works with my wacky eyes

[21:27] <Expy> TEARS

[21:27] <Narayan> Doesn't 3D eliminate the need for AA?

[21:27] <SSFKyori4> Hitokage: watching on espn or where?
[21:28] <Narayan> Sea_Manky: Then explain it to me. I never claimed to know anything.
[21:28] <EGM92> 3ds get
[21:28] <stump> he is right, aliasing is reduced by 3d layers
[21:28] <HandsomeHomeless> syllogism: yeah taht doesn't look good
[21:28] <GaimeGuy> David: I think it uses a different mechanism
[21:28] <EGM92> time to sell off my DSi
[21:28] <Sea_Manky> You are just showing two renderings, each from a slightly different perspective, to each eye.
[21:28] <HitokagePC> SSFKyori4: espn1 yeah
[21:28] <Vic> One guys is crying
[21:28] <Sea_Manky> So aliasing will still be noticable.
[21:28] <mac> So will I get MGS3 on PSP?
[21:28] <mac> or what?
[21:28] <David> Gaime: I know, but supposedly Youtube's 3D video thing allows for multiple forms of viewing
[21:28] <David> Gaime: One being red/blue glasses
[21:28] <impiri> is gametrailers doing a pre-show for sony?
[21:28] <Sea_Manky> stump: It will be reduced, but there will still be a need for it.

[21:31] <mac> I'm playing peace walker
[21:31] * stump has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[21:31] <jett> luckett: it's the MGS3 model
[21:31] <mac> it's sweet
[21:31] <Lone> shoooooot*
[21:31] <HitokagePC> hahahahah
[21:31] <Narayan> Snake Eater is still one of the best looking games to me, though.
[21:31] <GaimeGuy> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[21:31] <vulva> that's like asking if icecream is gonna rape a girl guide
[21:31] <GaimeGuy> ice cream :D
[21:31] <jett> snake eater still looks good
[21:31] <Vic> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRr
[21:31] <jett> north kroea am cry
[21:31] <MrPing1000> north korea used their weather device to make it the coldest world cup game ever
[21:31] <mac> Peacewalker sucks when you have to search for a sniper and they are like 3 pixels big
[21:31] <David> So, in other news, Matt Cassawhatever was finally right.
[21:31] <Vic> phil: ugh, that not PS1 gfx!
[21:31] <David> There's a Kid Icarus coming to the Wii.
[21:31] <Lone> Jett's a proven dumdum
[21:31] <Alone> did anyone download the Resident Evil 3DS Artwork?
[21:32] <GaimeGuy> David
[21:32] <GaimeGuy> no
[21:32] <GaimeGuy> 3ds
[21:32] <Lone> even Gran Turismo 1 looked good...at the time
[21:32] <Vic> NK to score the first goal
[21:32] <HitokagePC> wow
[21:32] <David> Oh?
[21:32] <SantaC> i really the 3DS
[21:32] <syllogism> http://kotaku.com/5564204/hands+on-with-seven-nintendo-3ds-games-and-gadgets
[21:32] <David> I thought it was Wii, based on the video clips
[21:32] <GaimeGuy> teh video was for the 3ds
[21:32] <HitokagePC> he just walked over that NK player
[21:32] <Lo-Volt> It's really 3DS.
[21:32] <HitokagePC> PUSHOVERS
[21:32] <Bob_Coffee> icarus is 3ds
[21:32] <phil> Vic, but PS1 resolution :)
[21:32] * GaimeGuy slaps David around a bit with a large trout
[21:32] <David> Ah. Hmm.
[21:32] <Bob_Coffee> if 3ds has tegra, we might see some good shit come out of it with the 2nd gen of games.
[21:32] <David> The 3DS is really just a portable GC/Wii with 3D and whatever. On steroids.
[21:32] <phil> it doesnt, bob
[21:32] <bluemaxwork> are there tech specs yet?
[21:32] <bluemaxwork> as a psp developer
[21:32] <Vic> phil: the resolution? that irrevelant, really.
[21:32] <bluemaxwork> i want tech specs
[21:33] <bluemaxwork> i need to compare!
[21:33] <Lone> wait, is there a new Paper Mario?
[21:33] <Luckett> Peace Walker cutscene:
[21:33] <Luckett> http://i48.tinypic.com/4rfbi9.jpg
[21:33] <HitokagePC> brazil would have been offsides there
[21:33] <GaimeGuy> bluemaxwork: lol
[21:33] <phil> If it were a (new) tegra, it would look way better
[21:33] <mac> Peace Walker doesn't look that good
[21:33] <EGM92> peacewalker is awesome
[21:33] <GaimeGuy> only tech spec that's really known is the resolution
[21:33] <Vic> Fucking CBC stream, it's out of sync!
[21:33] <EGM92> chapter 3 is way too short
[21:33] <mac> it is awesome
[21:33] <Lone> wait, is there a new Paper Mario?
[21:33] <bluemaxwork> hmm
[21:33] <alr1ght> PW looks great, but the dithering is turrrible BRRRRRRRRRRRR
[21:33] <bluemaxwork> wish i had access to nintendos dev site
[21:33] <bluemaxwork> i have access to ms and sonys
[21:33] <GaimeGuy> hax it
[21:33] <Amir0x> Yes Lone
[21:33] <Amir0x> YES
[21:34] <HitokagePC> whoa
[21:34] <mac> The only thing I don't like in Peace walker is how it contantly reminds you that you can play co-op
[21:34] <David> Retros "new DKC" looks sort of like DKC mixed with Jungle Beat.
[21:34] <Alone> bluemaxwork: what do they have on  there?
[21:34] <HitokagePC> I can actually hear the crowd in this match
[21:34] <Lone> Why didn't anyone say so?!??1
[21:34] <mac> even on levels where it would hardly be fun
[21:34] <HitokagePC> wtf
[21:34] <HitokagePC> BLOW HARDER
[21:34] <bluemaxwork> uh
[21:34] <bluemaxwork> technical materials?
[21:34] <milh31> Zelda trailer but quality is not top notch (it's still processing) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWKtx-N5EMU
[21:34] <bluemaxwork> sdks
[21:34] <mac> I can't imagine playing co-op without the person being in the same room
[21:34] <bluemaxwork> documentation
[21:34] <GaimeGuy> BBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[21:34] <bluemaxwork> presentations
[21:34] <bluemaxwork> white papers
[21:34] <mac> it would just be frustrating
[21:34] <Alone> oh
[21:34] <David> Clicks
[21:34] <bluemaxwork> stuff for developers
[21:34] <Alone> bet only you get hardon's for that =P
[21:34] * urbanscholar has joined #ga
[21:35] <David> Ah, they included Majora's Mask in the flyover intro
[21:35] <GaimeGuy> yes
[21:35] <GaimeGuy> they did
[21:35] <GaimeGuy> :D
[21:35] <bluemaxwork> what can i say
[21:35] <Rotanibor> yo
[21:35] <David> Someone has taste
[21:35] <GaimeGuy> nintendo hasn't forgotten ;_;
[21:35] <Rotanibor> there is no way Sony can beat Nintendo
[21:35] <Rotanibor> no way
[21:35] <HK-47> Ami, I am excited about new Paper Mario.  Gimme my whimsical hilarity
[21:35] <bluemaxwork> reading spurs documentation makes me randy
[21:35] <bluemaxwork> lulz
[21:35] <Alone> MM? WHERE?
[21:35] <bluemaxwork> one guy on north korea has a cell phone
[21:35] <David> Right handed Link = wrong
[21:35] <olubode> I just need the sony conference to just be half as good as the nintendo one
[21:35] <EGM92> Rot
[21:35] <EGM92> KEVIN BUTLER > x
[21:35] <bluemaxwork> and he impressed his teammates with it
[21:35] <Lone> so new version of DS has Pilotwings, Paper Mario, Mario Kart and other remakes of remakes?
[21:35] <bluemaxwork> theyd never seen one!
[21:36] <bluemaxwork> lone, i think the nintendo remakes
[21:36] * java888 is now known as java329
[21:36] <bluemaxwork> might be tehc demos
[21:36] <bluemaxwork> for e3
[21:36] <Alone> Lone: starfox looks good
[21:36] <bluemaxwork> but i could be wrong
[21:36] <Lone> will any of these run on the previous 2 or 3 versions of DS that I've wasted money on?
[21:36] <olubode> no
[21:36] <Rotanibor> who is kevin bulter
[21:36] <Alone> wider screen
[21:36] <Rotanibor> lol
[21:36] <olubode> you could you know, sell them
[21:36] <Lone> can I blame you and the rest of GAF then?
[21:36] <David> Bowling with bombs, new to Zelda
[21:36] <Unison__> sounds like it's not a system for you
[21:36] <Rotanibor> oh that guy
[21:36] <Lone> I've got to blame someone for this
[21:36] <phil> Lone, wasted? have you looked at the DS's library of games?
[21:36] * BossG has left #ga
[21:36] * BossG has joined #ga
[21:36] <Lone> Phil, have you seen where my DS is?
[21:36] <bluemaxwork> blame canada
[21:37] <Lone> seriously, I don't know where it is
[21:37] <phil> no? 
[21:37] <Lone> shit
[21:37] <Lone> anyone else?
[21:37] <Flachmatuch> north korea
[21:37] <Alone> lol
[21:37] <David> Oh, folks are going to whine about that. It looks like there will be paper airplane weapons and bowling bomb weapons in the new Zelda.
[21:37] <bluemaxwork> brasil hasnt scored yet
[21:37] <bluemaxwork> fail
[21:38] <azentium> it's only been 7 minutes lol
[21:38] <GaimeGuy> lol
[21:38] <bluemaxwork> exactly
[21:38] <impiri> i hope zelda skyward sword isn't going to have that awful HUD overlay all the time
[21:38] <bluemaxwork> theyre supposed to win 100 to nil
[21:38] <GaimeGuy> btw didn't sony's conference start already?
[21:38] <mac> I bet there is a lot of pointless legwork in Zelda too
[21:38] <impiri> sony is in 20 mins
[21:38] <urbanscholar> 7 minutes in which I haven't seen Korea be agreesive thus far
[21:38] * stump has joined #ga
[21:38] <mac> I liked teh first zelda, your mission was just to kill shit
[21:38] <mac> the first two games
[21:38] <Rotanibor> yo
[21:38] <urbanscholar> agressive*
[21:38] <Rotanibor> i am way more hyped for this new zelda
[21:38] <mac> not all this fetching shit
[21:39] <Rotanibor> than i was for twilight princess
[21:39] <David> What's the URL to the 3ds press sheet, again?
[21:39] <mac> You had to be good with the sword
[21:39] <Lone> so, is there a countdown to when the NKorean's turn into Cochroaches, yet?
[21:39] <mac> handy with the steel if you know what I mean
[21:39] <Rotanibor> this looks way better than twilight princess
[21:39] <mac> REGULATORS!
[21:39] <GaimeGuy> only complaint i've heard initially about the 3ds is that the effect only occurs in a very narrow viewing angle
[21:39] <Luckett> at least Twilight Princess had its own art-style
[21:39] <azentium> compared to univision, the announcers at espn sound dead 
[21:39] <vulva> mount up!
[21:39] <impiri> you are worthress arec bardwin
[21:39] <David> Gaime: Does that really matter much with a handheld, though?
[21:39] <olubode> mac: 16 in the clip and one int hole
[21:39] <GaimeGuy> well it  could
[21:39] <azentium> and i can't even understand half of what the univision guys are saying
[21:39] <darkh23> link turned in his tights for cargo pants?   http://imgur.com/rbmCK.jpg
[21:39] <mac> yeah, look what I got going
[21:40] <vulva> nate dogg is about to make smoe bodies turn cold
[21:40] <stump> so if nintendo is publishing layton 3 and level 5 is publishing layton 5, what happens to layton 4?
[21:40] <vulva> *some
[21:40] <impiri> zelda: relaxed fit
[21:40] <urbanscholar> I prefer the commentators on ESPN one of them is a real douche
[21:40] <GaimeGuy> stump:  lost to the depths of time
[21:40] <GaimeGuy> ;_;
[21:40] <SantaC> "As you can see the graphics are okay, but not overwhelmingly impressive. This style of quasi-realism does not look great on the aging Wii hardware."
[21:41] <Wes_BRRRRRRRAZIL> holy crap
[21:41] <Enkidu> http://e3.nintendo.com/images/ctr/othergames/scct/3.png someone forgot to texture his weapon?
[21:41] <Wes_BRRRRRRRAZIL> North Korean centre forward dribbling past 3 brazilian defenders
[21:41] <GaimeGuy> lol
[21:41] <bluemaxwork> korea got a shot on goal
[21:41] <Tiduz> lol splinter cell
[21:41] <bluemaxwork> amazing
[21:41] <Tiduz> do not want
[21:41] <Expy> still 0-0
[21:41] <Wes_BRRRRRRRAZIL> I'm impressed
[21:41] <Expy> surprised
[21:41] <Expy> lol
[21:41] <Rotanibor> http://e3.nintendo.com/ds/game/?g=sonicds the sonic 3ds game
[21:41] <urbanscholar> at least the centre forward was pushing
[21:41] <Wes_BRRRRRRRAZIL> NK are really organised
[21:41] <darkh23> "Although the game is in very early shape we came away really impressed with the precision of the new swordplay. Having a crazily accurate sword is the sort of thing the Wii was built for and we couldn't be more excited to play more. Rest assured Zelda's gameplay absolutely cuts Red Steel 2's swordplay to pieces!"
[21:41] <Expy> they were promised a feast if they lost by only 3 goals
[21:41] <Expy> ;o
[21:41] <mac> that sounds scary
[21:41] <mac> like bullshit
[21:42] <Luckett> no Rotanibor
[21:42] <Luckett> thats DS
[21:42] <Rotanibor> oh
[21:42] <Vic> NK ain't bad
[21:42] <Tiduz> video doesnt load Rotanibor
[21:42] <Tiduz> failsite is fail
[21:42] <Rotanibor> i won't load for me either
[21:42] <Rotanibor> which is why i didn't know it was just DS
[21:42] <Rotanibor> haha
[21:42] <Luckett> its the Sonic Rush looking one
[21:42] <Luckett> and the big NINTENDO DS tab at the top

[21:42] <GaimeGuy> wat
[21:42] <Luckett> being highlighted

[21:42] <Luckett> in the DS section
[21:42] <Tiduz> Article Preview
[21:42] <Tiduz> Want to see the new Xbox 360 slim destroying a disc? Well now you can thanks to a clever chap at E3 moving the system whilst it was reading a disc.
[21:42] <Tiduz> nice.
[21:42] <olubode> lol @ the relevation of SSF4 on gaf
[21:43] <olubode> er, revelation
[21:43] <Rotanibor> whats gaf saying
[21:43] <bluemaxwork> revelation?
[21:43] <olubode> they didn't know yet
[21:43] <olubode> there is some doubt and freaking out
[21:43] <bluemaxwork> oh
[21:43] <David> Trying to get into GAF before the Sony conference kills it twice.
[21:43] <bluemaxwork> doubt about what?
[21:43] <Lo-Volt> Tiduz: which fucking idiot was that?
[21:43] <Rotanibor> lol
[21:43] <TheNatural> Then I shot a two-minute video to show you the game in action. Good stuff. Sword controls were superb, and closer to 1:1 than I expected (note the little leans of the sword when I tilt my hand). Bowling bombs feels right.
[21:43] <Tiduz> dunnl
[21:43] <Tiduz> dunno
[21:43] <Alone> "Does the slider go all the way to 4D? "
[21:43] <Tiduz> btw
[21:44] <Alone> heh
[21:44] <vulva> g-funk where rhythm is life
[21:44] <Tiduz> and 3d dj hero vids yet
[21:44] <Tiduz> lolol
[21:44] <Animal> Rythm Heaven 3D would be hot
[21:44] <David> The one year I don't go, and we get 3D gaming. Tsk tsk tsk.
[21:44] <syllogism> the controls look good enough based on that video
[21:44] <olubode> heh @ David
[21:44] <darkh23> yep
[21:45] <darkh23> lol you can bowl with bombs?
[21:45] <David> Maybe I was the reason Nintendo did so badly the past few years. Heh
[21:45] <David> The only thing I don't like out of this Zelda info is that you have to do Wii Sports Resort - style archery, instead of simple trigger pulling.
[21:45] <David> Please add a crossbow...
[21:46] <olubode> well, ICO collection just got confirmed by amazon
[21:46] <vulva> release date?
[21:46] <Alone> ps3?
[21:46] <Expy> NK playing well
[21:46] <Narayan> ICO COLLECTION FOR 3DS.
[21:46] <olubode> yes
[21:46] <Tiduz> i just realized something
[21:46] <olubode> amazon france says 2011
[21:46] <Tiduz> is the dsi xl screen bigger than ds3d
[21:46] <vulva> ah
[21:46] <vulva> so nothing new
[21:46] <olubode> june 30th 2011
[21:46] <Mandoric> i wasn't impressed with the 1:1 sword
[21:46] <Alone> Tiduz: pobs
[21:46] <vulva> ah
[21:46] <vulva> kk
[21:46] <Alone> probs
[21:46] <Mandoric> they need to break it down to make it more playable
[21:46] <jman2050> Zelda is old news
[21:46] <impiri> i loved archery in sports resort
[21:46] <jman2050> it's all about KIRBY
[21:46] <jman2050> HAAAAAI
[21:46] <TheNatural> lol brazil still hasnt scored
[21:46] <Mandoric> srtokes beginning at 478962
[21:46] <jett> what is this shit
[21:46] <jett> what's taking brazil so long
[21:47] <impiri> EPIC YARN
[21:47] <vulva> kirby looks so good
[21:47] <Mandoric> and a thrust
[21:47] <Tiduz> kirrrrrrrrrrbbbbbbyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[21:47] <jett> what a worthless piece of shit world cup
[21:47] <jett> srsly
[21:47] <azentium> lol
[21:47] <David> IGN said it looked like Zelda wasn't working right in the conference.
[21:47] <Tiduz> donkey kongggggg
[21:47] <jman2050> Kirby is GOTS so far
[21:47] <Tiduz> nintendo <3
[21:47] <vulva> also, where was the vitality censor?
[21:47] <Alone> wait
[21:47] <Vic> jett: it's the temperature
[21:47] <vulva> I was curious for that
[21:47] * Jshogouki has joined #ga
[21:47] <azentium> i would love the meltdowns in north korea somehow won this 
[21:47] <HK-47> Kirby > DKC
[21:47] * BJ has joined #ga
[21:47] <Alone> i just realised something
[21:47] <Alone> WHIP
[21:47] <syllogism> are you saying you arent rooting for NK
[21:47] <Alone> wheres my castlevania wii?
[21:47] <Tiduz> vitality sensor got cancelled
[21:47] <syllogism> NK NK NK
[21:47] <Tiduz> back to real gaming
[21:47] <Axord> Alone: link with a whip
[21:47] <vulva> tiduz, officially cancelled?
[21:47] <stump> Alone: ... why would a third party make a game for the wii
[21:47] <Tiduz> cockring next year for 360
[21:47] <Alone> not good enough
[21:47] <Tiduz> nah not officially
[21:47] <vulva> ah
[21:47] <darkh23> ubisoft got vitality punked
[21:47] <vulva> would be nice
[21:47] <Alone> b-b-but konami loves the DS
[21:48] <Axord> stump: boredom?
[21:48] <olubode> LOL @ Onlive's free year. Oh and EviLore is Ice Cold
[21:48] <David> No Wiiware announcements? Hmm
[21:48] <Animal> JET MOTO PS3 in 3D BEWEIVE
[21:48] <Alone> how long till sony conference?
[21:48] <azentium> 1h 30m
[21:48] <Luckett> 10 mins
[21:48] <Tiduz> aliasing on 3ds is kinda nuts
[21:48] <Axord> 15 min
[21:48] <Tiduz> or its shitty screens
[21:48] <Alone> ...
[21:48] <stump> Axord: that explains Firefighter Rescue 2010 or whatever
[21:48] <David> Mario Sports Mix
[21:48] <Tiduz> or 3d adds AA effect
[21:48] <EGM92> fuck akuma and his air fireball
[21:48] <Axord> stump: heh
[21:48] <EGM92> well fuck the spammers
[21:49] <GaimeGuy> so um
[21:49] <Alone> what AA? did you see the mgs screens?
[21:49] <mac> fuck this, gaf is down and it's my hub for images and vids
[21:49] <GaimeGuy> nintendo wins
[21:49] <stump> Tiduz: 3d gives a "free AA" in many cases so you may be seeing the lack of AA hurt worse than it will in reality.
[21:49] <Alone> pixels galore
[21:49] <Tiduz> niiice
[21:49] <Tiduz> good news
[21:49] <David> Mario Sports Mix = Sequel to Wii Sports/Resort + Mario?
[21:49] * mintywork has joined #ga
[21:49] <Tiduz> i want a 3ds
[21:49] <Tiduz> yesterday
[21:49] <mac> Does the PS3 thing still look like this?  http://www.thesixthaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/wand_2_610_w500.jpg
[21:49] <Tiduz> yes.
[21:49] <darkh23> I pretty much want every game they showed except the party crap
[21:49] <mac> a light bulb on top of a wii wand
[21:49] <mac> that's innovation
[21:49] <Alone> lolipop
[21:49] <Luckett> i will play kirby wii in secret
[21:49] <mac> they should  add a toaster too it
[21:49] <Tiduz> if it works it works
[21:49] <Tiduz> :d
[21:49] <Luckett> never in front of anyone
[21:49] <Luckett> ever
[21:50] <mac> how does a light work?
[21:50] <Alone> was the 2d kirby for 3ds?
[21:50] <Tiduz> mac
[21:50] <Luckett> wii
[21:50] <Tiduz> red for fire
[21:50] <mac> it's just lights
[21:50] <Tiduz> green for wind
[21:50] <Tiduz> etc
[21:50] <alr1ght> that;s how it works. The bulb helps measure the depth
[21:50] <Tiduz> eyecam recognizes it
[21:50] <Tiduz> it uses a camera too remember
[21:50] <Sea_Manky> mac: You're missing the true innovation.  The Move wand has no sharp corners like the Wiimote, so it will be very comfortable for vaginal/rectal insertion
[21:50] <Luckett> the only actual full game shown for 3DS is Icarus
[21:50] <mac> as long as it's functional
[21:50] <Luckett> all the others are tech demoes and stuff
[21:50] <threi> holy shit @ north korea holding their own
[21:50] <mac> no no no, never put a light bulb up your butt
[21:50] <Mandoric> nanky: beaten by wii condom
[21:50] <Tiduz> btw
[21:50] <bluemaxwork> 20 minutes in
[21:50] <Tiduz> 0 ms e3 demos on xbl ?
[21:50] <bluemaxwork> still no brasil goal
[21:50] <bluemaxwork> fail
[21:51] <Tiduz> i am dissapoint
[21:51] <mac> If talking to ER doctors has taught me anything it's never put a lightbulb up your Hey Hey
[21:51] <darkh23> haha gerstmann twitter   "*pouring out a 40 for the no-show vitality sensor*"
[21:51] <Sea_Manky> Mandoric: Still can't help with the shape.  Sony has truly outdone Nintendo in owning the waggle dildo market.
[21:51] <syllogism> you imperialists are in for a surprise
[21:51] <GaimeGuy> Nintendo just took a dump all over MS's chest
[21:51] <Tiduz> As its E3 week, the PlayStation Store will be publishing daily starting today through Thursday, 6/17. Today you'll be able to get your hand on the 'NCAA Football 11' PS3 Demo from Electronic Arts (find it in the dedicated E3 2010 category under New Releases).
[21:51] <Tiduz> ooooh
[21:51] <olubode> gerstmann as always is right
[21:51] <threi> lol
[21:51] <osaka> sony conference is probably superbad
[21:51] <mintywork> Zzzz
[21:51] <Luckett> Icarus looked good though
[21:51] <GaimeGuy> a big, steamy dump
[21:51] <mac> I was at gamestop buying PeaceWalker and they have crazy used PSP games
[21:51] <Tiduz> GaimeGuy just took a fap all over a rag
[21:51] <GaimeGuy> a big, steamy fap
[21:52] <GaimeGuy> wait, what
[21:52] <David> Wait, if Nintendo says the 3ds can show 3d movies, does this imply some sort of movie "channel" is coming to the 3ds?
[21:52] <mac> I've got to load up as soon as I see what is good or not
[21:52] <GaimeGuy> no
[21:52] <azentium> hopefully if it's bad, it's funny bad 
[21:52] <TheNatural> lol brazil
[21:52] <David> Netflix 3DS
[21:52] <mintywork> sony conference is going to be utterly boring
[21:52] <olubode> OH MAN
[21:52] <stump> David: they specifically said they have absolutely no plans for any kind of movie distribution, just that it's possible
[21:52] <Sea_Manky> It's E3, it's always utterly boring
[21:52] <Alone> David: sd card + import movies
[21:52] <Wes_BRRRRRRRAZIL> Brazil are way too narrow
[21:52] <olubode> that shit better happen David/Stump
[21:52] <Tiduz> mintywork is joining the ntards now
[21:52] <stump> David: this is why it's important to read and watch as opposed to just reading a few sentences and then asking what people think
[21:52] <Tiduz> and pre ordering natal
[21:52] <David> Stump: Okay. The IGN thingie made it sound like they had a deal with 3 different studios
[21:52] <Tiduz> in the fire with you!
[21:52] <Yann> is there a stream for konami conference?
[21:52] <mintywork> i didn't order kintecshit
[21:52] <Tiduz> u will
[21:52] <mintywork> i just got the new 360
[21:52] <Luckett> looks like the Kojima + Sony relationship is over for good
[21:52] <Tiduz> penis in uno to deal cards
[21:53] <mintywork> i don't want that kitechsheet
[21:53] <Luckett> not 1 exclusive for them and their show
[21:53] <David> Stump: I'm reading. and watching.. as best as I can when on a lunch break. I beg your forgiveness.

[21:53] <Luckett> nah, no more slots on their site
[21:53] <Expy> luckett: no exclusive from kojima for any platform
[21:53] <Mandoric> kojima loves whoever puts shiny shit in front of him
[21:53] <jett> minty: is this the new one super quiet, ps3-like?
[21:53] <phil> How was the stream quality for Nintendo?   which one works best (for sony)?
[21:53] <Mandoric> sony hs no shiny shit this year
[21:53] <mintywork> olu: i ordered from amazong. i don't have it yet
[21:53] <Tiduz> im glad rr ds is made
[21:53] <Tiduz> sign franchise aint dead
[21:53] <jett> sea_manky: not even in SD lololool
[21:53] <mintywork> it's supposed to be whisper quiet!
[21:53] <azentium> GameTrailers has the best quality, but it's the furthest behind 
[21:53] <olubode> oh ok...I just sold my 360 and all my games
[21:54] <jett> 410x240 resolution
[21:54] <phil> although the GT player is pretty good, it had some slowdowns
[21:54] <mintywork> you did? ;0
[21:54] <jett> i'm gonna use jewtube

[21:54] <azentium> G4 has the closest to live stream, but the quality isn't that good
[21:54] <mintywork> yeah figures. you're hardly onrine anyway

[22:03] <MrPing1000> don't all 3dtvs use the tv tech from last year, so the new 2d tvs out this year are actually better than the 3d ones
[22:03] <Lone> so, is Ecosystem Sony's new Buzzword???
[22:03] <mac> oh, dropping the blu-ray bomb
[22:03] <Withnail> yeah lets get this out the way now

[22:03] <EGM92> Lone it was MS' buzzword for the last 3 years
[22:03] <GaimeGuy> after nintendo's shot at needing glasses
[22:03] <EGM92> on both windows and 360
[22:03] <GaimeGuy> this is going to seem lame

[22:50] <David> Hey, you're right.
[22:50] <jman2050> so they're just trying to establish *something*
[22:50] <Captain_Orin> ALL THIS HAS BEEN DONE
[22:50] <David> They didn't do any PSP stuff at all.
[22:50] <TheNatural> unison, you need an eye thing too though
[22:50] <Tiduz> do we have time left for psp/ps3 ?

[22:50] <Expy> it's 2 hour conference
[22:50] <Alone> Captain_Orin: sorcere was good
[22:50] <jett> unison: the reality is that the "navigation controller" isn't needed, you can use the sixaxis instead (lol)
[22:50] <Unison__> fight still looks awful yeah haha
[22:50] <Lone> I assume some games don't even need both the controllers
[22:50] <Tiduz> kinect rip 2010-2010
[22:50] <alr1ght> Capatin is very mad today
[22:50] <Tiduz> kinect rip 2010-2010
[22:50] <David> Oh. Never mind.
[22:50] <java329> 90s clubbing medley
[22:50] <jman2050> and now they're copying Wii ads
[22:50] <jobber> the eye was $10 2 years ago
[22:50] <Narayan> Tiduz: LOL. So true.
[22:50] <jman2050> still better than Kinectlol
[22:50] <Lone> so, cheap bastards could just buy one controller and the games that go with it

[22:50] <kassatsu> zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[22:50] * mib_75p7q5 has quit IRC (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[22:50] <HadesGigas> they should have used PS Home people, ahah
[22:50] <milh31> TheNatural : but you need the 30 nunchuck for most "core" game 
[22:50] <jman2050> bye Kinext
[22:50] <Withnail> wait, no it didn't
[22:51] <Unison__> $80 is a bit much yeah
[22:51] <Captain_Orin> fail
[22:51] <Wes_BRRRRRRRAZIL> RIP SKITTLES
[22:51] <olubode> DAT ASS
[22:51] <TheNatural> at least sony is making it clear its just an add on for current games ... i guess thats good? 
[22:51] <olubode> did you see DAT ASS?
[22:51] <Unison__> $100 too :|
[22:51] <Expy> comes with a game
[22:51] <HadesGigas> $130
[22:51] <Gatsu-Kun> I NOTICED THE ASS TOO
[22:51] <BJ> i saw
[22:51] <Gatsu-Kun> IT WAS SEXY
[22:51] <Expy> kinect  = 150 with nothing
[22:51] <David> I really don't see the Move seriously impacting the Kinect market. Nor the other way around
[22:51] <jman2050> Kinect sent to die
[22:51] <HadesGigas> a lot of games require 2 balls
[22:51] <bluemaxwork> hes like 2 feet from the tv
[22:51] <bluemaxwork> wtf
[22:51] <Unison__> oh kinect is total trash
[22:51] <Expy> they dont require
[22:51] <Somnia> hades no they dont
[22:51] <MrPing1000> PEW PEW PEW
[22:51] <TToBdroid> Chubby chasers!
[22:51] <Somnia> they can USE 2
[22:51] <kassatsu> i can only think of ddr when i hear this song
[22:51] <TheNatural> so $100 for eye toy, controller and game .. but another $30 for nunchuck thing
[22:51] <Somnia> but dont require
[22:51] <Unison__> move seems good though
[22:51] <Expy> NOTHING requries 2
[22:51] <Expy> 2 is optional
[22:51] <Narayan> Time Crisis looks neat.
[22:51] <itsgreen> pricing has not been announced for Kinect. 
[22:51] <Alone> lol
[22:51] <Withnail> time crisis
[22:51] <Acosta> time crisis?

[22:51] <Alone> ps3 gets its own onrails fanfest
[22:51] <mac> Re5 looks neat
[22:51] <Lone> I thought the $100 was for eye, game, and both controllers
[22:51] <Brannon> Remember, people wont' 'see' the extra 30 bucks if they buy it a month later. That's how it works. NOT 149 OUT THE FUCKING BOX MS.
[22:51] <Unison__> yeah lone
[22:51] <java329> they screwed up by not bundling the nunchuck
[22:52] <azentium> LoTR?
[22:52] <Wes_BRRRRRRRAZIL> tron
[22:52] <jman2050> Move and Wii
[22:52] <Unison__> agreed java
[22:52] <Expy> Lone: You can use a dualshock
[22:52] <jman2050> tag teaming for motion control goodness
[22:52] <Narayan> Tron looks janky.
[22:52] <HitokagePC> oo
[22:52] <HitokagePC> tron
[22:52] <AdamF> move is stupid
[22:52] <HitokagePC> haha
[22:52] <jman2050> while MS sits in a corner
[22:52] <ElyrionX> apart from sorcery this doesn't evenv look all that superior to wii or natal
[22:52] <AdamF> its just the wii
[22:52] <AdamF> again
[22:52] <itsgreen> pricing has not been announced for Kinect. 
[22:52] <jman2050> playing make believe
[22:52] <AdamF> with prettier graphics
[22:52] <Lone> well, I already have an Eye
[22:52] <Lone> *collecting dust somewhere
[22:52] <MrPing1000> lol wtf u can bounce off the lines in tron, u are supposed to explode if u touch them
[22:52] <Withnail> not bad
[22:52] <milh31> the music is so corny
[22:52] <Tiduz> AdamF: and why is that a bad thing again ?
[22:52] <Sykra> ms will need to take a hit on pricing kinect
[22:52] <jett> eh
[22:52] <jett> eh
[22:52] <jett> eh
[22:52] * Lovingsteam has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[22:52] <itsgreen> pricing has not been announced for Kinect.

[23:47] <Tiduz> sigh
[23:47] <Unison__> i hope this is PSN only
[23:47] <David> Wario: But gamesharing is a FEATURE Sony WANTED us to use. It's not an abuse!
[23:47] <alr1ght> still 13 minutes left. Give me TLG BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[23:47] <Unison__> it looks like crap dark
[23:47] <Wes_> fucking clown
[23:47] <Somnia> its a store release
[23:47] <Withnail> not a psn game
[23:47] <Lone> eat a dick, Dick
[23:47] <Somnia> its reservable at gamestop already
[23:47] <GaimeGuy> threi: the shocker was  that portal 2 is not coming only to the 360 and PC, but also the PS3
[23:47] <azentium> Nuke?
[23:47] <Unison__> why is it so ugly?
[23:47] <Tiduz> the shocker was
[23:47] <Wes_> Class based play?
[23:47] <jett> where is uncharted 3 huh amir0x
[23:47] <jett> PWNEd
[23:47] <Tiduz> gabe was on stage
[23:47] <Tiduz> and steam
[23:47] <Gatsu-Kun> NUKE INCOMING
[23:47] <GaimeGuy> also,  sony moneyhatted valve to cancel their portal event to unveil protal 2 and the ps3 conference
[23:47] <Gattsu25> Gameplay looks like a loose TM:B but that helicopter shit looked weak
[23:47] <azentium> looks like an xbox 360 launch game
[23:47] <FirewalkR> where's last guardian and NOMURA?
[23:47] <syllogism> what did jaffe lie about? 
[23:48] <Tiduz> GaimeGuy is bitter
[23:48] <Tiduz> he expected he could troll move all e3
[23:48] <Tiduz> huaha
[23:48] <GaimeGuy> tiduz is imagining things
[23:48] <vulva> gaimeguy or valve decided to abandon their fanbase for a paid appearance
[23:48] <GaimeGuy> why would I be bitter? :D
[23:48] <EviLore> this looks good
[23:48] <Somnia> ya
[23:48] <vulva> you can twist that however you want
[23:48] <Narayan> SHOOT THROUGH THAT SIDE MIRROR.
[23:48] <Somnia> looks awesome
[23:48] <the_abominable_snowman> Depressing. Sony is pandering to the PS2-era gamers :/
[23:48] <Gattsu25> Now what was this shit about Steam on PS3?
[23:48] <Unison__> this totally doesnt look good to me at all
[23:48] <the_abominable_snowman> Times like this I miss Sega
[23:48] <David> Heheh
[23:48] <David> Sega
[23:48] <David> Heheh
[23:48] <GaimeGuy> Gattsu:   Gabe revealed that steam cloud is coming with portal 2 to the PS3
[23:49] <GaimeGuy> i have a bad feeling that it'll be PSN+ exclusive though
[23:49] <Gattsu25> so Portal 2 saves can cross between PS3 and PC?
[23:49] <Lovingsteam> wait, WAIT
[23:49] <Tiduz> reminds me a bit of warhawk
[23:49] <Lovingsteam> Steam is coming to PSN?
[23:49] <milh31> Too much explanation 
[23:49] <Lovingsteam> how?
[23:49] <Tiduz> dont get the hate
[23:49] <David> If "steam cloud" only refers to Portal 2 on PSN, then it really doesn't mean much, right?
[23:49] <azentium> this looks overly complicated? 
[23:49] <Expy> Lovingsteam: yes
[23:49] <Unison__> right David
[23:49] <Acosta> looks fun
[23:49] <Killthee> i think its using the warhawk engine
[23:49] <Road> This has to be a PSN game.
[23:49] <Lovingsteam> Expy, like the store?
[23:49] <Lovingsteam> thats not possible
[23:49] <Somnia> its not a fucking psn title already
[23:49] <GaimeGuy> david:  hmm, could point
[23:49] <Gattsu25> this music fucking sucks
[23:49] <Unison__> *gong* 
[23:49] <Amir0x> I'm in
[23:49] <Narayan> Needs a lot of polish.
[23:49] <Unison__> haha
[23:49] <Captain_Orin> back
[23:49] <Unison__> seriously, it is bad carnival music
[23:49] <GaimeGuy> I'd get the feelign that if steam tiself were coming, they'd have focussed on that a little more
[23:49] <BossG> dragged behind the car Texas style
[23:49] <David> I mean, that just means that ... well... what "Steam Cloud" support does Portal have?
[23:49] <Captain_Orin> oh goawd they still on this?
[23:49] <jett> this shit is not worthy of being a conference closer
[23:49] <Wario64> this game has too much fucking explanation for a twisted metal game
[23:49] <Tiktaalik> this is weak
[23:49] <Unison__> it's like the metroid music but worse
[23:50] <milh31> And after 3 years of explanation you can shoot some stuff
[23:50] <Narayan> What the FUCK.
[23:50] <jett> compare this garabge to god of war 3 last year
[23:50] <Unison__> seriously jett
[23:50] <kassatsu> not feeling this
[23:50] <Tiktaalik> this is like the most complicated game of all time
[23:50] <David> The most logical thing I'd assume is that it meant you get to play the game on any Steam platform -- and we know that they aren't doing that
[23:50] <olubode> flaming chainsaws
[23:50] <Unison__> this is trash
[23:50] <Captain_Orin> jett
[23:50] <Wes_> FLAMING CHAINSAWS
[23:50] <jman2050> yawn
[23:50] <Wario64> this game gonna fail like calling all cars lol
[23:50] <Captain_Orin> they will have something else
[23:50] <azentium> wtf
[23:50] <Captain_Orin> BELIEVE
[23:50] <Narayan> WHY DO THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS SHIT.
[23:50] <Road> It's all GAF's fault,though...
[23:50] <Gattsu25> David: your settings and saves are uploaded/downloaded to/from the cloud
[23:50] <Luckett> its the most complex game type ever made
[23:50] <Captain_Orin> dont care
[23:50] <vulva> this looks so terrible
[23:50] <Captain_Orin> dont care
[23:50] <Luckett> if you have to speak this long to explain it, it fails
[23:50] <Narayan> Fuck this.
[23:50] <Gatsu-Kun> UMM
[23:50] <centracore> i was hoping for some last guardian or uncharted 3
[23:50] <vulva> I want the last guardian
[23:50] <Shalashaska> 10 mins left
[23:50] <Somnia> fuck yes
[23:50] <Gatsu-Kun> THIS SHIT LOOKS WACK

[23:52] <David> Nintendo > Sony > EA > Sega > MS
[23:52] <EGM92> tiduz stfu
[23:52] <Unison__> Nintendo A Sony C Microsoft F-
[23:52] <FirewalkR> well. when's GC? xD
[23:52] <Withnail> but still makes the ms shows look piss poor
[23:52] <GaimeGuy> look, twisted metal is nice, but.... really?
[23:52] <Shalashaska> i am disappoint
[23:52] <azentium> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRr
[23:52] <Tiduz> go fuck ur brother
[23:52] <Gatsu-Kun> THIS WAS BULLSHIT
[23:52] <RagnarokX> Well, the only game I really liked was LBP2
[23:52] <EGM92> you'd like that
[23:52] <Gattsu25> <Killthee>	yes they announced psn +   <--  Sony FAIL
[23:52] <Axord> David: harsh. But fair.
[23:52] <Gatsu-Kun> BUT THEY STILL DID BETTER THE 360
[23:52] <Withnail> some nice exclusive stuff
[23:52] <EviLore> sony c, microsoft c-, nintendo b+
[23:52] <jett> crap conference
[23:52] <RagnarokX> Twisted Metal was kinda disappointing
[23:52] <HK-47> LBP 2 was bouncing
[23:53] <DrForester> So NIntendo Killed gaming 4 years ago.  BUt today they saved it?
[23:53] <RagnarokX> too much like Twisted Metal Black
[23:53] <darkh_phone> FIAL
[23:53] <Acosta> Nintendo won this by a landlide
[23:53] <Flachmatuch> kirby wins e3
[23:53] <azentium> the irony of it all
[23:53] <Gatsu-Kun> SONY WAS A B-
[23:53] <Axord> DrForester: gotta kill it to save it
[23:53] <azentium> Nintendo has the best conference lol
[23:53] <Gatsu-Kun> 360 = D
[23:53] <java329> was that really 2 hours?
[23:53] <Expy> Nintendo A-, Sony B, MS F-----
[23:53] <HK-47> Flach: Kirby is the winner
[23:53] <RagnarokX> I don't think helicopters are a good idea in Twisted Metal
[23:53] <Withnail> nintendo A, sony B-, ms F
[23:53] <Wario64> Kevin Butler skit was so pathetic
[23:53] <milh31> They had twisted metal featuring ICP, they don't need no Last Gayrdian FOULS
[23:53] <Wario64> cringeworthy
[23:53] <seantos> i wish valve had their own conference and we could have seen more portal 2
[23:53] * java329 has quit IRC (Quit: java329)
[23:53] <David> If we were conspiracy theorists, this would be proof that the Wii was just to trick MS and Sony into shooting themselves in the feet
[23:53] <Gattsu25> Gatsu-Kun: with PSN+ they can't get anything above a C
[23:53] <GaimeGuy> nintendo had the best conference and a ton of shit post conference
[23:53] <BJ> what is chick's name on G4?
[23:53] <Sykra> kb was awesome
[23:53] <Unison__> it cant be contested at all that Nintendo won that shit haha
[23:53] <impiri> so uh... does the clown just sit there now?
[23:53] <BossG> I will never get the time back from watching these conferences
[23:53] * Reno- has joined #ga
[23:53] <Unison__> yes imp
[23:53] <EviLore> sony conference could've been a B if they had made it 1 hour long instead of two
[23:53] <Unison__> he is serving everyone ice cream
[23:53] <Tiduz> nintendo won
[23:53] <Wes_> Nintendo > Sony > World Cup > Microsoft
[23:53] <milh31> Nintendo delivered
[23:53] <Tiduz> sony did well
[23:54] <GaimeGuy> evilore: or shown PSP2
[23:54] <Tiduz> ms was a disaster
[23:54] <Gattsu25> it was two hours?
[23:54] <Gattsu25> lol
[23:54] <jett> sony was awful
[23:54] <Road> Nintendo and Sony had comparable conferences, but Nintendo's Press Releases ruled it all.
[23:54] <impiri> i think he just got out of the truck and walked away
[23:54] <Tiduz> jett is awfull
[23:54] <impiri> hahahahahaha
[23:54] <RagnarokX> but EviLore, then they would have to cut out some montages
[23:54] <Captain_Orin> I wonder if valve canceled their press conference for this?
[23:54] <Gatsu-Kun> 15(Gattsu2515): PSN+ can be redeeming if they release the feature list
[23:54] <David> I'm surprised Nintendo didn't do anything on WiiWare
[23:54] <Mandoric> sony was ehh
[23:54] <jett> tiduz: shut up sonytard!
[23:54] <Unison__> hahaha
[23:54] <Flachmatuch> no way sony was comparable
[23:54] <Mandoric> we saw excatly what we expected
[23:54] <Tiduz> shut up 3dstard!
[23:54] <olubode> MS was a D for sure
[23:54] <Flachmatuch> nope
[23:54] <GaimeGuy> Captain:    I'm 99% sure they did
[23:54] <Unison__> he realized twisted metal is a flop
[23:54] <Mandoric> maybe a little upgrade for gabe
[23:54] <Animal> I'm thinking of walking out the door and buying a Wii right now
[23:54] <jman2050> Nintendo had awesome 3DS reveal and KIRBY
[23:54] <Captain_Orin> MS at least had the lulz
[23:54] <jman2050> Sony and LBP2
[23:54] <jman2050> Sony had LBP2
[23:54] <Gattsu25> Gatsu-Kun: Wait...they didn't even announce what the features would be?  
[23:54] <Mandoric> nintendo was :bow :bbow
[23:54] <Tiduz> kirbyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
[23:54] <Gattsu25> hahaha
[23:54] <seantos> sony money hatted valve to get them to announce portal 2 there
[23:54] <Animal> Donkey Kong Return sold the Wii to me
[23:54] <GaimeGuy> Nintedo had hoes for the audience
[23:54] <Tiduz> kkkkkkkkkkkkkirby
[23:54] <Mandoric> ms was terribad
[23:54] <David> Animal: you might as well. It's not like ht price is gong down any time soon
[23:54] <TheNatural> Donkey Kong Country > all
[23:54] <Captain_Orin> <seantos> sony money hatted valve to get them to announce portal 2 there
[23:54] <Gatsu-Kun> nope... no feature list
[23:54] <Captain_Orin> thats wat im thinking
[23:54] <EviLore> MS had entertainment value though
[23:54] <Tiduz> ms should feel shitty now
[23:55] <David> Animal: For that matter, someone on CAG found a way to get a Wii + Sports Resort for $140
[23:55] <Withnail> sony's was a pretty good show but nintendo's was an all time classic
[23:55] <DrForester> NIntendo's goign to set up a sepcial web site for gamer apppologies
[23:55] <EviLore> SKITTLES
[23:55] <HK-47> DKC didnt really do much for me
[23:55] * jett is now known as jett\amir0xPWNED
[23:55] <Gattsu25> I gave Nintendo shit but they had the best conference, going by what I hear about the Sony conference
[23:55] <Captain_Orin> White guy dancing
[23:55] <EviLore> WHITE GUY WITH BACKUP DANCERS
[23:55] <Captain_Orin> haha
[23:55] <Flachmatuch> nintendo announced new games at least
[23:55] <EviLore> that counts for a lot
[23:55] <DeezNutz> nintendo's showing this year is the greatest showing in e3 history imo
[23:55] * Milabrega has joined #ga
[23:55] <TToBdroid> Twisted Mental!
[23:55] <Captain_Orin> ^5 evilore
[23:55] <Tiduz> the white guy gif
[23:55] <Animal> David: How? I'm in Canada
[23:55] <HK-47> I want a Skittles of my own!  Just 149.99
[23:55] <Tiduz> was lolololol
[23:55] <jobber> ign 500'n
[23:55] * Subliminal has joined #ga
[23:55] <alr1ght> Ninty >>>> Sony >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>MS
[23:55] <David> Animal: Not sure then. Some wacky bundle back at Wal-Mart. Buying one and returning most of the bundle.
[23:55] <Unison__> nintendo really delivered big time... the only disappointment was that Zelda waggle SNAFU
[23:55] <TheNatural> why does sony's take so fucking long .. they didnt have to include half that shit
[23:55] <jett\amir0xPWNED> nintendo > 500 errors > sony > microsoft
[23:55] <Captain_Orin> Impossible calories burned simulator
[23:55] <David> Although I keep seeing $150 deals flitting around on CAG as of late.
[23:55] <Gattsu25> my problem with Nintendo is that I only really care about 2 of their franchises.  2D metroid and Mario platformers
[23:55] <vulva> man twisted metal looked awful
[23:56] <GaimeGuy> unison: Zelda wasn't the only title that had problems during on s tage demos
[23:56] <Withnail> sony have been announcing new games almost weekly for the last month
[23:56] <jman2050> all about KIRBY
[23:56] <GaimeGuy> was definitely interference
[23:56] <Flachmatuch> but zelda was probably tech problems
[23:56] <jman2050> new KIRBY game will
[23:56] <Unison__> they wanted to show you games that were already out
[23:56] <jman2050> will own
[23:56] <Tiduz> i wonder what ms will do next year
[23:56] <jman2050> did I mention KIRBY
[23:56] <Gattsu25> I don't have any love for kirby or DK (unless it's DK Jr)
[23:56] <TToBdroid> Your face looked awful
[23:56] <Flachmatuch> as we played all of that stuff in wsr already
[23:56] <EviLore> sony should've been one hour.  then they could've packed it with their exclusive stuff and it would've had much more punch
[23:56] <Tiduz> drop natal games?
[23:56] <Withnail> yeah tm doesn't look too hot
[23:56] <Tiduz> or more lol
[23:56] <TheNatural> Donkey Kong Country
[23:56] <HK-47> Best part of SOny conf was LBP 2 and the MvC3 trailer I watched during it.  Oh and Sorcery.
[23:56] * Shalashaska has quit IRC (Quit: )
[23:56] <Tiduz> wheres
[23:56] <Tiduz> mvc3
[23:56] <David> Gatt: This is a DK not buy Rare. It might be actually DK.
[23:56] <alr1ght> yeah, Sony's content was great. We knew it all though.
[23:56] <Tiduz> does it have gameplay
[23:56] <David> by
[23:56] <Captain_Orin> all those montages werent neccesary
[23:56] <Withnail> sorcery looked cool
[23:56] <David> BY
[23:56] <phil> sorcery has nice controls.
[23:56] <RagnarokX> G4: Sony had a solid showing
[23:56] <HK-47> Tiduz: Its all gameplay
[23:56] * olubode has quit IRC (Quit: olubode)
[23:56] <Gattsu25> David: yeah, I guess that's true.
[23:56] <Unison__> MVC3 shit over any game in either MS / Sony conference
[23:56] <phil> but that s all they showed
[23:56] <Flachmatuch> also, no move aiming support for ds2 :-(
[23:56] <Tiduz> omg
[23:56] <Unison__> n odoubt
[23:56] <EviLore> lbp2, sorcery, yeah, those looked cool
[23:56] <Captain_Orin> Yea, sorcery was the only thing that looked awesome
[23:56] <Tiduz> omg
[23:56] <Tiduz> where
[23:56] <Flachmatuch> move will fail
[23:56] <Unison__> i mean sony wasnt pathetic by any means
[23:57] * Kagari- has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[23:57] <impiri> so let's see... it's $150 for kinect and $80+ps eye for move
[23:57] <Tiduz> move wont fail as hard as natal.
[23:57] <David> Well, we all know the Move will fail. It's on the PS3, for starters.
[23:57] <Withnail> nice price for move
[23:57] <Unison__> but ending with TM is bad
[23:57] <TheNatural> if you're a sony fan, sony did good, but it was stuff you probably wouldnt go out and buy a ps3 for if you didnt already have one
[23:57] <Unison__> TM was really bad
[23:57] <Withnail> some good games
[23:57] <DrForester> No Last Guardian = Sony Sucked
[23:57] <RagnarokX> Sony was just way too long and boring
[23:57] <DrForester> give it up unison
[23:57] <phil> on a game with a normal controller, good controls are expected and don't have to be mentioned
[23:57] <HitokagePC> move looks like it'll be better than wiimote
[23:57] <HK-47> Tiduz: http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=121428301232375&ref=mf
[23:57] <HitokagePC> but eh
[23:57] <David> Mass market gimmick on PS3 won't sell.
[23:57] <HitokagePC> EH
[23:57] <Somnia> Nintendo killed it
[23:57] <Withnail> november for GT5
[23:57] <Tiduz> thank u
[23:57] <HitokagePC> to waggle in general
[23:57] <Unison__> Move would be more exciting if it wasnt overpriced so badly
[23:57] <GaimeGuy> wasn't pretty much everyone expecting PSP2 as well?
[23:57] <Gattsu25> Kirby looked amazing but if, say, Capcom were the devs it would have been a WiiWare release
[23:57] <impiri> okay, eye is $40, so it's $120 total to get started
[23:57] <TheNatural> Move = $130 for everything
[23:57] <GaimeGuy> instead we got a new PSP ad campaign
[23:57] <David> I mean, the 360 has a better chance with Move... but it has Kinect.
[23:57] <Subliminal> NIIIIINTENDO WINS
[23:57] <Milabrega> Does Capcom have their own event?
[23:57] <Animal> GT5GT5GT5GT5GT5
[23:57] <Tiduz> (GaimeGuy) wasn't pretty much everyone expecting PSP2 as well?
[23:57] <Tiduz> no.
[23:57] <HK-47> I wish Capcom had an event =(
[23:57] <Withnail> kinect games are horrible though
[23:57] <Tiduz> already been leaked no psp2
[23:57] <alr1ght> Still hoping for a surprise TLG trailer on the show floor
[23:57] <DrForester> is there any real proof there's a PSP2 or is it all sepculation?
[23:57] * Tim_the_Wiz has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.6.3/20100401080539])
[23:57] <RagnarokX> the jugalo should have had his head set on fire
[23:57] <Gattsu25> But then when you get down to it, I just down like Kirby platformers.  Looks can only go so far
[23:58] <EGM92> the lack of SSF4 in this chat is saf
[23:58] <Mandoric> no one -expected- psp2
[23:58] <Tiduz> there is no proof.
[23:58] <David> Kinect is overpriced and stupid. Move is on a platform even less likely to get mainstream buyers.
[23:58] <EviLore> <HitokagePC> move looks like it'll be better than wiimote   <HitokagePC> but eh
[23:58] <HK-47> And that event was just MvC3
[23:58] <EGM92> sad
[23:58] <Animal> its all speculation because of the psp go hate
[23:58] <EviLore> pretty much
[23:58] <EGM92> lets go
[23:58] <Gattsu25> Zelda looked amazing
[23:58] <Acosta> when is the PC conference
[23:58] <Gattsu25> I'm pretty hyped for that
[23:58] <TheNatural> sony didnt want to show psp2 yet because they had to look and see what to rip off from nintendo
[23:58] * Jshogouki has quit IRC (Quit: )
[23:58] <Mandoric> everyone said there needed to be psp2 to save the platform
[23:58] <EviLore> amazingly broken
[23:58] <TheNatural> before they could show it
[23:58] <Mandoric> but everyone expected snoy to fu,ble

[23:58] <EviLore> acosta:   :D
[23:58] <jett\amir0xPWNED> i'm surprised the sony thread has more posts thanthe nintendo one
[23:58] <jett\amir0xPWNED> weird
[23:58] <Gattsu25> EviLore: I didn't get to see much of the presentation...just the last few minutes
[23:58] <EviLore> WITCHER 2 FUCK YES
[23:58] <Gattsu25> so I'm only talking about the art style.
[23:58] <Mandoric> there's nothing to argue about in the nintendo one
[23:58] <Captain_Orin> Score Card: Sony: C Nintendo A- MS: See me after school
[23:58] <Gattsu25> They showed Witcher2?
[23:58] <Mandoric> nintendo won
