[00:05] <Sarrus> where are the iw's in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Tracklist ?
[00:06] <litherp2> how come there are no language to language dictionaries on wikipedia?
[00:06] <[Soap]> probably because there would need to be n^2 of them, where n is the number of languages we'd be doing
[00:06] <[Soap]> it's not really suited for a wiki
[00:06] <killiondude> litherp2: There's wiktionary. Which is multilingual.
[00:07] <killiondude> www.enwp.org/wikt:Main_Page
[00:07] <litherp2> killiondude: it's not from one language to another.
[00:08] * Daedalus969 has joined #wikipedia-en
[00:08] <killiondude> It's not a translation dictionary, no. But it lists words' meanings in each language. http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/run
[00:08] <killiondude> sorta kinda.
[00:08] <[Soap]> I think the reason I gave is pretty much the answer
[00:09] <litherp2> [Soap]: it would take a lot of effort, but if soembody wants to do it then more power to them.
[00:09] * BRIAN__ has quit IRC (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
[00:10] <Qcoder00> litherp: If you want to start a translation dictiponary project on Wikiversity feel free
[00:10] <Qcoder00> Just don't expect anyone to do it for you or sing your praises initally :)
[00:11] <litherp2> i'm looking at the current state of translation dictionaries online and they are horrible. perfpect wiki project.
[00:12] <Qcoder00> litherp2 -> Wikiversity and get started :)
[00:12] <killiondude> google does a relatively good job

[01:00] <killiondude> You may thank PeterSymonds by nominating him to be a steward.
[01:00] <Qcoder00> Check Sfan00_IMG's recent contribs
[01:00] <PeterSymonds> killiondude, noo.
[01:00] <Ottava> I'd nominate Peter for steward
[01:00] <Ottava> even though he'd suck
[01:00] <PeterSymonds> Probably.
[01:01] <Ottava> Do you even speak any languages?
[01:01] <PeterSymonds> No.
[01:01] <Ottava> We know you don't speak English
[01:01] <Ottava> hmm
[01:01] <Ottava> Well, you might still pass

[01:01] <Ottava> If Lar can be a steward, then, well
[01:01] <Ottava> ;/

[01:19] <Ironholds> I was drinking gin
[01:19] <Ottava> Bitch : (
[01:19] <Qcoder00> Ottava: Assuming you are Over 21 that is
[01:19] <MissAlyx> Ottava doesnt understand the concept of conventional logic.
[01:19] <Ottava> Gin is for Irish people who don't care about their children
[01:19] <MissAlyx> Qcoder00: thats doubtful
[01:19] <Ottava> according to that Gin Lane image
[01:19] <SpitfireWP> PeterSymonds: perhaps if you'd be so kind: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Olemus http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Y2Stu http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CheesesChrist

[01:20] <White_Cat> lies
[01:20] <Ironholds> Ottava: first time I got hammered? Gin
[01:20] <SpitfireWP> Peter: thanks. :)
[01:20] <Ironholds> second time I got hammered? Also gin
[01:20] <PeterSymonds> You're welcome.
[01:20] <White_Cat> Bin Laden probably is dead
[01:20] <Qcoder00> Ironholds:  Maybe you should stop drinking GIN?
[01:21] <White_Cat> but he is a replacable generic villan you know
[01:21] <Qcoder00> and I have to go
[01:21] <White_Cat> with a beard like that even obama can pretend to be him
[01:21] <Ottava> Gin is good
[01:21] * Qcoder00 has left #wikipedia-en
[01:21] <White_Cat> Bin Laden should be shaved.
[01:21] <Ottava> Ironholds - first time I got hammered - Jegermeister, about the age of 6
[01:21] <White_Cat> I reccomend a non-binding UN resolution to this end.
[01:22] <White_Cat> Ottava can you tell that I am very bored?
[01:22] <Ottava> Everyone is very bored
[01:22] <Ottava> Do you go to college?
[01:22] <White_Cat> No?
[01:22] <White_Cat> They let me off of that place
[01:22] <Ottava> Hmm
[01:22] <White_Cat> with a sheet of paper
[01:22] <Ottava> Well, most bored people in here are college kids
[01:22] <White_Cat> "Diploma" WTF?
[01:22] * Stroppolo has joined #wikipedia-en
[01:22] <Ottava> who are smoking way too much and drinking way too much
[01:23] * White_Cat never smoked
[01:23] * White_Cat doesnt drink anything
[01:23] <Ottava> hmm'
[01:23] <White_Cat> exept chocolate milk
[01:23] <Ottava> I spent 7 years of my life not sober
[01:23] <White_Cat> and chocolate milk is bad ass according to back to the future
[01:24] <Ottava> I received a fan letter for my column today
[01:24] <Ottava> woo
[01:24] <Ironholds> Ottava: yes, and yes
[01:24] <MissAlyx> some people in here need shooting.
[01:24] <MissAlyx> guess who.
[01:24] <MissAlyx> suprisingly, its not Ironholds
[01:24] <Ironholds> to bored, student, drinking, smoking
[01:24] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: you need shooting, actually
[01:24] <Ottava> Poor Ironholds
[01:24] <MissAlyx> no, someone else :P
[01:24] <MissAlyx> i bet Aqwis could guess
[01:24] <White_Cat> hmm
[01:24] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: not ottava
[01:24] * Mm40 has joined #wikipedia-en
[01:24] <Aqwis> hello MissAlyx
[01:24] * SveroH|away has quit IRC
[01:24] <Aqwis> what have I done now?
[01:24] <Ironholds> his usefulness outweighs his outrageously arrogant, narcissistic personality
[01:24] <White_Cat> the director of the movie seems to enjoy shooting
[01:24] <MissAlyx> Ironholds: fairly close!
[01:24] <White_Cat> targets tho
[01:25] * Ottava snuggles MissAlyx
[01:25] <MissAlyx> get rid of "not"
[01:25] <White_Cat> he goes to shooting ranges whenever he visits the US
[01:25] <Ottava> : )
[01:25] <MissAlyx> Ironholds: oh come on, someone equally as useful can be found
[01:25] <White_Cat> Ottava did you know? They use actual film directors for anime movies
[01:25] <Ottava> Aqwis is a narcissist?
[01:25] <Ottava> : (
[01:25] <White_Cat> I did not know that.
[01:25] <Aqwis> what, no
[01:25] <Ottava> White Cat - yah
[01:25] <Ottava> Because you have to organize various things
[01:25] <White_Cat> True
[01:25] <Aqwis> I only love myself slightly!
[01:25] <White_Cat> but I'd imagine anime ones and film ones would be seperae
[01:26] <White_Cat> at the end both do very different things
[01:26] <MissAlyx> Aqwis: atleast you are slightly sane, more than others
[01:26] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: you're not competent enough to define usefulness
[01:26] <Ironholds> or sanity
[01:26] <Aqwis> I have failed.
[01:26] <MissAlyx> of course i am :P
[01:26] <White_Cat> Ottava I learnt a lot about anime from that 1.5 hour comentary
[01:26] <Ottava> I like Aqwis <3
[01:26] <White_Cat> Aqwis wa shikkaku
[01:26] <Ottava> White Cat - that is a long commentary
[01:26] <MissAlyx> im right on the border of sanity and insanity, it makes me the perfect person to define it
[01:26] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: you're an arrogant, ignorant, narcissistic right winger
[01:26] <Ironholds> three of those four traits are shared by Ottava
[01:26] <Ottava> MissAlyx is a right winger?
[01:26] <White_Cat> Ottava the anime plays with the commentary as subtitles
[01:26] <Ottava> omai
[01:26] <Russavia> PeterSymonds, you about?
[01:27] <MissAlyx> perfectly sane people are easier to say "theyre insane" because they dont see the insane side of the scale :P
[01:27] <Aqwis> Ironholds, which one isn't?
[01:27] <Ironholds> Ottava: he claims if the BNP and greens had some middle-party, he'd vote for them
[01:27] <MissAlyx> i see both, so i can group them better
[01:27] <killiondude> I thought Ottava was gay? he's still a right-winger?
[01:27] <PeterSymonds> Russavia, yep.
[01:27] <Ironholds> Aqwis: most of the time he's not ignorant. most of the time
[01:27] <Aqwis> I see.
[01:27] <Ironholds> Killiondude: straight, afaik
[01:27] <Russavia> any chance you could get this one for me please? --> http://www.jstor.org/pss/717152
[01:27] <Ironholds> but Narson is gay

[01:27] <Ironholds> brb, writing a GA review and listening to the bugle

[01:29] <White_Cat> compared to what people use today
[01:29] <Ottava> So MissAlyx is a dude
[01:29] <Ottava> omai
[01:29] <[Soap]> I would have written it as 'hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhot!'
[01:29] <Ottava> Soap <3
[01:30] <Ottava> So anyway, it appears that I'm the only heterosexual male in here

[01:30] <Ottava> you have a vagina
[01:30] <killiondude> ^
[01:30] <Ottava> wait, no, you -are- a vagina
[01:30] <MissAlyx> heterosexual males are statisticaly more violent.
[01:30] <Ottava> : P
[01:30] <White_Cat> gah
[01:30] <White_Cat> 80 000 000 Japanese yen = 880 080 U.S. dollars
[01:30] <White_Cat> there
[01:30] <White_Cat> MissAlyx not really
[01:30] <Ironholds> I do not have a vagina
[01:31] * BendersGame has joined #wikipedia-en
[01:31] <MissAlyx> yes really.
[01:31] <White_Cat> statistics fail to account for repressed emotions
[01:31] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: your theory is supported by the fact that I want to punch you in the face
[01:31] <Ottava> Ironholds - I already corrected it to say that you were one
[01:31] <Ottava> Hey Lucifer!
[01:31] <MissAlyx> good
[01:31] <White_Cat> all men are gay
[01:31] <killiondude> Lies.
[01:31] <White_Cat> well
[01:31] <White_Cat> all men are intimate with their own penises
[01:31] <White_Cat> thats pretty gay
[01:31] <Ottava> Egotism =/= homosexuality
[01:31] <Ottava> ;/
[01:31] <White_Cat> women use dildos
[01:32] <Ottava> And men use hand vaginas ;/
[01:32] <PeterSymonds> I think we can move on from this now.
[01:32] <White_Cat> hand vaginas?
[01:32] <Ottava> yes
[01:32] <Aqwis> PeterSymonds, don't kill the fun
[01:32] <White_Cat> PeterSymonds is right
[01:32] * Ottava mawls PeterSymonds
[01:32] <White_Cat> lets talk about anime again
[01:32] <Ottava> Bubblegum Crisis <3
[01:32] <White_Cat> Ottava what else do you remember from the real record of loddos war?
[01:33] <Ottava> I remember it ended abruptly and stupidly
[01:33] <Russavia> why do i have the feeling i have come into a 4chan irc channel?
[01:33] <Ottava> which was disappointing
[01:33] <Ottava> 4chan - as long as its not /f/
[01:33] <Ottava> Thats the one with the hentai, right?
[01:33] <Ottava> buh
[01:33] <Aqwis> did you expect it to be the IRC equivalent of the Encyclopedia Britannica office?
[01:33] <Ottava> Encyclopedia Britannica's office is just a bunch of sell outs sitting around talking about how lame they are
[01:33] <Ottava> And that they wish they were smart enough to be real academics
[01:33] <Ottava> those pricks
[01:34] <White_Cat> Aqwis you'd have to pay for that

[01:34] <Aqwis> thank god
[01:34] <[Soap]> whatd he do this time>
[01:34] <Ironholds> we blocked him for 24 hours for acting like a douche, and made it clear it was his final final FINAL warning
[01:34] <Ottava> Poor MisterWiki : (
[01:34] <Ottava> We?
[01:34] <Ottava> >.>
[01:34] <[Soap]> he's actually unblocked right now
[01:34] <Ottava> <.<
[01:34] * Ottava peers at Ironholds
[01:34] <Ironholds> he then thought it appropriate to call admins who didn't let him off for his article contributions....
[01:34] <Ottava> "we"?
[01:35] <Ironholds> NAZIS! YAAAAY!
[01:35] <Ironholds> Ottava: "the ANI people"

[01:35] <Ottava> oh, I see
[01:35] <Ottava> I never called admin nazis
[01:35] <Ottava> : )
[01:35] <[Soap]> 'call' as in on the phone ?
[01:35] <White_Cat> I know britanica is old but I doubt they use pricks to write it
[01:35] <Ottava> I'm actually on good terms with half of the admin who blocked me ;/
[01:35] <[Soap]> oh I misread
[01:35] <Ottava> White Cat - they use pricks because they lack brains
[01:35] <Ottava> ;/
[01:35] <[Soap]> so, wait, what is he doing?  I dont erven see any edits from him today
[01:36] <Ottava> Anyway, Britannica sucks

[01:36] <Ottava> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ANI#MisterWiki._Again.
[01:36] <Aqwis> I thought he was to be indefblocked if he did anything wrong
[01:36] <Ironholds> Aqwis: he was
[01:36] <Ottava> "User:MisterWiki has not learned."
[01:36] <Ironholds> so he called admins Nazis
[01:36] <Aqwis> and yet you blocked him for 24 hours only?
[01:36] <Ottava> Ironholds, grammar fail!
[01:36] * Algebraist has joined #wikipedia-en
[01:36] <[Soap]> I dont think that's going get him indef'ed
[01:36] <Ironholds> Aqwis: no, Gwen did for writing a redirect titled "piss-on-elmo"
[01:36] <Aqwis> and someone unblocked him because he was called a nazi?
[01:36] <Ironholds> Soap: he was on his super-duper last warning
[01:36] <Ironholds> Aqwis: no
[01:36] <Ironholds> that came afterwards
[01:36] <Aqwis> then why wasn't he indeffed for writing that redirect?
[01:36] <[Soap]> well anyway, that edit is from 23 hours ago
[01:37] <Ironholds> Aqwis: it was made clear he was on his final, final, FINAL warning
[01:37] <killiondude> oh. :-(
[01:37] <killiondude> his cat died.
[01:37] <[Soap]> I think if he was going to get blocked for that, it would have been set by now
[01:37] <Ironholds> Killiondude: certainly a valid defence
[01:37] <White_Cat> cats gotta die
[01:37] <Ottava> "that he would get his game together and stop treating WP like a place to have fun"
[01:37] <Ottava> LULZ
[01:37] <Aqwis> and I thought he got his last+1 warning when he was unblocked from his first indef
[01:37] <White_Cat> fish gotta fly
[01:37] <MrZ-man> you're allowed to insult admins, because once you do, every admin has an automatic COI

[01:38] <[Soap]> just consider me skeptical, ironholds
[01:38] <killiondude> He's not currently blocked, Ironholds.
[01:38] <killiondude> It expired.

[01:56] <MissAlyx> like nuke proof bomb shelters

[02:29] <TheCuriousGnome5> Someone wants to remove the Space exploration section from the article [[2000s (decade)]]. he claims that in his opinion the section is not worthy of being included because no prominant events happend in that field.

[02:30] <Aqwis> the advent of private space crafts is a pretty prominent event
[02:31] <TheCuriousGnome5> indeed

[03:47] <MissAlyx> uuuugh.. look at all those edits..
[03:48] <MissAlyx> must be atleast 30..
[03:48] <Ironholds> yes
[03:48] <PeterSymonds> I'll semi it for a day. Will you be able to clean it up?
[03:48] <Ironholds> and I just reverted them all at once
[03:48] <Ironholds> Peter: cleaned
[03:48] <PeterSymonds> Excellent, thanks.
[03:48] <MissAlyx> i was trying to work out which one to revert back to
[03:48] <Ironholds> and there were about 20
[03:48] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: compare the revision currently with the one you can last rely on (anything BWilkins has done)
[03:48] <Ironholds> if the comparison diff contains only crap, revert it all
[03:48] <Ironholds> simple
[03:49] <Ironholds> or, and this would be a suggestion
[03:49] <Ironholds> if it's too interleaved with good edits, just go through and remove the crap
[03:49] <MissAlyx> yours still has a link to "http://sao.gamon.net/index.aspx", which i suspect is a personal advertisement
[03:49] <MissAlyx> its not english so i cant tell ..

[04:43] <Ottava> Hi Killiondude
[04:43] <Ottava> Refs are blowing this game between Ravens and Colts
[04:43] <Ottava> they claimed a hit of shoulder to shoulder was a hit between heads
[04:43] <Ottava> even though there was a clear foot of space
[04:43] <Ottava> other bs calls
[04:43] <Ottava> its nuts

[04:44] <Ottava> Hi jdelanoy : )
[04:44] <jdelanoy> hi Ottava
[04:44] <Ottava> How are you?

[04:45] <Ottava> She made a really nasty attack on Catholics the other day
[04:45] <Ottava> what an idiot
[04:45] <jdelanoy> that election is about as close as it can get
[04:45] <jdelanoy> O_O
[04:46] <jdelanoy> at first I thought that was Angela Merkel in that picture...
[04:46] <Ottava> Nah, Brown is ahead, so its not close
[04:46] <Ottava> The Democrats always skew 5 points in Mass
[04:46] <quanticle|away> Ottava: Is that why the game is turning out to be so boring?  I mean, I really expected the score to be higher by now.
[04:47] <kyorosuke> Ottava: what did she say about Catholics?
[04:47] <quanticle|away> jdelanoy: Apparently, their campaigning styles are similar.  Coakley and Merkel both run low key campaigns.  Unfortunately, her disadvantage is that she's up against an agressive, charismatic opponent.
[04:47] * quanticle|away is now known as quanticle
[04:47] <Ottava> She said that Catholics shouldn't work in hospitals if they are against abortions
[04:48] <Ottava> And claimed that all hospitals are state paid so religious people have no rights
[04:48] <Ottava> Even though 90% of hospitals are private
[04:48] <jdelanoy> quanticle: I wouldn't know, I don't follow German politics
[04:48] <jdelanoy> :|
[04:48] <kyorosuke> oy
[04:48] <kyorosuke> if someone isn't working in a clinic that performs abortions then it doesn't really matter, does it
[04:48] <Ottava> Quanticle - Colts gained 14 points from refs starting to cheat for them
[04:48] <Ottava> so
[04:49] <Ottava> Kyorosuke - the Senate health care plan would force all hospitals to perform abortions
[04:49] <Ottava> and all doctors
[04:50] <Ottava> It is a big issue that will come up at the March for Life this friday
[04:50] <Ottava> the biggest annual march at DC for quite a long time now
[04:51] <kyorosuke> but if you don't work in a gynecological field you won't have to perform them anyway
[04:51] <Ottava> Kyorosuke, all doctors would have to
[04:51] <Katrinplommon> In my country we push religious people off a cliff
[04:51] <Ottava> gynecologists don't perform abortions
[04:51] <Ottava> surgeons do
[04:52] <Ottava> No one can say no if a woman requests an abortion, even if there arent staff for it
[04:52] <Ottava> That is how the bill words it
[04:52] <Ottava> That is why people are really angry
[04:53] <kyorosuke> Katrinplommon, just one particular cliff, or all of them?

[05:48] <Ottava> those refs made it so Colts could win

[05:49] <Ottava> Flacco stopped running it, which is stupid
[05:49] <quanticle> Ottava: What did the refs do?  I tuned out after the first couple minutes and I'm only just now tuning back in.
[05:49] <Ottava> Quanticle - three times Colts were going to have to kick it away, 3 times in a row the refs made up fake calls
[05:50] <Ottava> like one was saying Ray Lewis hit his helmet into another guy, the replay showed that their helmets never touched let alone touch any part of the other person
[05:50] <quanticle> Ottava: Wow.  That sucks.
[05:50] <Ottava> Yep
[05:50] <Ottava> If you notice on the Ravens games, they never change their actions, but when the refs dont cheat like that the Ravens win
[05:50] <Ottava> when they do, Ravens lose

[05:51] <Daedalus969> for which?
[05:51] <Daedalus969> 278/283?
[05:51] <Shirik> the EF you had me make yesterday
[05:51] <Shirik> 283
[05:52] <Daedalus969> there has been activity
[05:52] <Ottava> Quanticle - only because of the refs
[05:52] <Daedalus969> on 278, at least.
[05:52] <quanticle> Ottava: Huh?
[05:52] <Ottava> they could have easily been put into touchdown range like the Colts were
[05:52] <Daedalus969> His edit summary didn't violate any rules
[05:52] <Daedalus969> but his edit tripped up 278
[05:52] <Daedalus969> With several positives, and a single false positive, I think it's safe to turn on

[06:16] <Ottava> and ignoring rather blatant holding
[06:16] <Tiptoety> Hi Ottava.
[06:16] <Ottava> No wonder the players union is striking next year with such refs
[06:16] <Ottava> They need a system to penalize these guys
[06:16] <Ottava> if they lost 25k per game for blown calls like that
[06:16] <Ottava> then they wouldnt make them

[06:17] <Ottava> It was a bullshit game from the beginning, and not football
[06:17] <Ottava> About 150k per year
[06:18] <Ottava> The Patriots game had the best refs in the NFL reffing

[06:48] <BasketOfPuppies> quanticle, hi
[06:49] <BasketOfPuppies> im a little doped up. sorry if i sound weird
[06:49] <quanticle> Just had a medical procedure done?
[06:49] <quanticle> Or just high for no reason?
[06:49] <BasketOfPuppies> quanticle, had surgery on thurs
[06:49] <MisterWiki> hi BasketOfPuppies
[06:49] <quanticle> Ah.  Okay.  What for?
[06:49] <BasketOfPuppies> quanticle, for a major csf leak
[06:49] <quanticle> csf?
[06:49] <BasketOfPuppies> cerebrospinal fluid
[06:49] <MisterWiki> cerebrospinal fluid leak
[06:50] <quanticle> Oh.  Whoa.  That's pretty dangerous, no?

[06:52] <quanticle> BasketOfPuppies: Well, that's good to hear.
[06:52] <MisterWiki> Yes.!
[06:53] <BasketOfPuppies> but the MRI showed that i have a huge cyst at the C7 vertebrae
[06:53] <BasketOfPuppies> and i will beed a major operation to resect and repair it
[06:54] <BasketOfPuppies> how is the wiki doing?
[06:54] <BasketOfPuppies> i've been away for a little while
[06:54] <quanticle> BasketOfPuppies: Is the cyst related to the CSF leak?
[06:54] <BasketOfPuppies> quanticle, yes, it's due to the leak
[06:54] <quanticle> BasketOfPuppies: Wikipedia is... well, its Wikipedia.
[06:55] <MisterWiki> Hi BasketOfPuppies, again. :-)
[06:55] <quanticle> So the leak caused the cyst to form?
[06:55] <BasketOfPuppies> MisterWiki, hi
[06:55] <BasketOfPuppies> quanticle, the CSF ballooned the dura mater out
[06:55] <BasketOfPuppies> like a balloon in your car tire
[06:55] <BasketOfPuppies> the weak spot
[06:56] <BasketOfPuppies> and there is a hole in the cyst and 90% of my csf is leaking out through it
[06:57] <BasketOfPuppies> quanticle, is the wiki suffering or thriving?

[06:58] <BasketOfPuppies> MisterWiki, i am sorry you've had some troubles on wiki
[06:58] <quanticle> BasketOfPuppies: Its hard to say.  I mean, how would one even measure whether the wiki is thriving or suffering?
[06:58] <MisterWiki> :'-(
[06:58] <BasketOfPuppies> quanticle, are the numbers of articles achieving GA and FA status increasing in frequency than one year ago?
[06:59] <quanticle> BasketOfPuppies: I don't think so.
[06:59] <Brian_S> So MisterWiki is blocked until 2020 o-O
[06:59] <BasketOfPuppies> quanticle, that's too bad
[06:59] <BasketOfPuppies> quanticle, i heard someone say that they felt the wiki has reaches a certain plateau of article number and now it's important to improve them
[07:01] <quanticle> BasketOfPuppies: Well, the discussion was about what we should do to encourage people to make existing articles better rather than add new articles?  Now that Wikipedia has a massive number of articles, the importance of a new article is less than the importance of an improvement to an existing article.

[07:10] <quanticle> BasketOfPuppies: Oh, that's unfortunate.  I mean, its one thing when the doctors know that there's a cyst and are looking for one.  Its quite another when they stumble across something like that while trying to fix another problem.
[07:11] <Tim1357> Yeah. Uploading my thoughts to freaking leaves.
[07:11] <Tim1357> O.o
[07:11] <BasketOfPuppies> Tim1357, i think that'd be nifty

[07:32] <ArmadniGeneral> woop woop
[07:33] <Tim1357> because they dont get to be welcomed to wikipedia
[07:33] <Tim1357> IMO
[07:34] <ArmadniGeneral> i never start out with a level 3 or 4...except once i think. for something vulgar i'd rather just use a level 2, because it doesn't have any of that "it might not have been your intention" crap
[07:34] * BasketOfPuppies is starring at the screen in an opiate induced state
[07:34] <darkfalls> I just block them :)
[07:34] <ArmadniGeneral> i mean, if they're really going to be a problem, you'll get to level 4, and then off to AIV, without too much trouble.
[07:34] <Tim1357> hah
[07:34] <Tim1357> I hate how they are given 5 chances before blocked
[07:35] <Tim1357> it should be more like 3

[07:36] <Tim1357> well
[07:36] <Tim1357> im a legalistic bastard

[07:43] <Shirik> and that's why 1 and 2 exist, and why I pretty much never use a 4im warning :)
[07:43] <Shirik> The only times I've used 4im are blatant and obvious and nobody in their right mind would believe that would be acceptable, even if just "trying out"
[07:43] * Tim1357 same
[07:43] <Tim1357> only i have a harsher margin of what is unnacceptable

[09:29] <Lara> Er, you may not be able to gift those. I think I just got that with this level.
[09:29] <Puffin> Cows are nice.
[09:29] * Puffin will check.
[09:29] <Lara> Uhm, that cross stitch thing, or a tree that isn't a date tree.
[09:29] <Lara> Please not that damn dragonfly, haha
[09:29] <Puffin> I can send a cow!
[09:29] <Lara> \o/
[09:29] <Puffin> Want that?
[09:29] <Lara> Ya
[09:30] * Puffin sent.
[09:31] <Lara> Thanks!
[09:32] <Puffin> Do you have a bull in your dairy thing?
[09:32] <Lara> No.
[09:32] <Lara> I have no bulls.
[09:33] * Puffin snickers.
[09:33] <Lara> Ha. There's an option to buy a post office and a general store now.
[09:33] <Lara> XD
[09:33] <Puffin> What do they do?
[09:34] * coffee has quit IRC (Nick collision from services.)
[09:34] * [Coffee] has joined #wikipedia-en
[09:34] * [Coffee] is now known as coffee
[09:35] <Lara> Uhm, I think you just get xp for it.
[09:35] <Lara> Let me look again.
[09:35] <Puffin> I think this collections thing they started is dumb.
[09:35] * MrZ-man has joined #wikipedia-en
[09:36] <Lara> 1k and 2k xp respectively.
[09:36] <Lara> Yea, I agree.
[09:36] <Puffin> I haven't even figured out how to get the collection items, besides through gifting!
[09:37] <Lara> I think you should make money off anything you own. Why should I pay $10k for a fruit stand that just sits there? For a lousy 100xp? No thx.
[09:37] <Lara> You get them when you plow.
[09:37] <Puffin> Yeah, like a steady cash flow or something.
[09:37] <Lara> They randomly appear when you plow.
[09:37] <Puffin> Oh, like the moneys?
[09:37] <Lara> I found a pocket watch a couple hours ago.
[09:37] <Puffin> Nice.
[09:38] <Lara> I saw a coin flip up in the air, and when I checked the collections thing, I had that one.
[09:38] <Lara> I actually saw two coins flip up, but I only saw the one thing.
[09:38] <Shirik> Tim1357, did you find something to do?
[09:38] <Puffin> Hrm, weird.
[09:38] <Tim1357> no
[09:38] <Tim1357> :(
[09:38] <Tim1357> i did a controll-f for 'bot' on the village pump
[09:38] <Tim1357> nothing that looks like fun is there
[09:38] <Tim1357> plus I already have one
[09:39] <Tim1357> and i need to finish it
[09:39] <Puffin> Bots are great fun.
[09:39] <Puffin> What does your bot do, Tim1357?
[09:39] <Tim1357> everything that you dont
[09:39] <Tim1357> :)
[09:39] <Lara> I'm off to bed. No passing my level, Puffin!
[09:39] * Lara is now known as Lara|Sleep
[09:39] <Tim1357> Right now its spamming people about unrefed BLPS
[09:39] <Tim1357> so boring shit
[09:39] <Lara|Sleep> Sounds like LaraBot
[09:39] <Tim1357> Yea
[09:40] <Tim1357> But its not
[09:40] <Lara|Sleep> Yours probably gives more info.
[09:40] <Tim1357> this does all of them, yours just does current ones
[09:40] <Tim1357> so
[09:40] <Tim1357> yea
[09:40] <Lara|Sleep> LaraBot is more like "Your article blows. Fix it. ~~~~"
[09:40] <Tim1357> hah
[09:40] * Freya likes LaraBot. XD
[09:40] <Freya> if that's the case. DX
[09:40] <Lara|Sleep> :p
[09:40] <Lara|Sleep> It's not mine. It's just named after me.
[09:40] <Tim1357> mines like "youre article blows, see [[WP:BLP]] go fix it, or not, dont yell at me ~~~~
[09:40] <Lara|Sleep> Cause it's a bitchy bot obsessed with BLP.
[09:41] <Tim1357> HAHA
[09:41] <Lara|Sleep> MZ saw the similarities.
[09:41] <Tim1357> das funny
[09:41] <Tim1357> i was wondering why that was

[09:41] <Tim1357> who is dis natalie and why do we all love her so?
[09:41] <Tim1357> or him
[09:42] <Lara|Sleep> Natalie is MZMcBride.
[09:42] <Lara|Sleep> He wrote LaraBot.
[09:42] <Lara|Sleep> And LawBot.
[09:42] <Lara|Sleep> And some other bots.
[09:42] <Tim1357> Ohhhhh
[09:42] <Lara|Sleep> I don't know what LawBot does, though.
[09:42] <Lara|Sleep> Buuuuut, it's lulzy, all considered.
[09:42] <Tim1357> Hey MZMMcBride: I saw the witch-hunt on VP
[09:42] <Tim1357> it looks scary
[09:42] <Lara|Sleep> Is that still going on?
[09:42] <Tim1357> dont get angry at anyone, please
[09:42] <Tim1357> I think so
[09:43] <Lara|Sleep> People with torches are fun.
[09:43] <Puffin> Tim1357, "we all" minus Puffin
[09:43] * Lara|Sleep slaps Puffin.
[09:43] <Lara|Sleep> stfu
[09:43] <Puffin> :)
[09:43] <Lara|Sleep> Okay, srsly, off for sleep.

[14:20] <Shirik> [Pmlineditor] do you have some kind of secret text?
[14:21] <[Pmlineditor]> :P
[14:21] <Shirik> Welcome to my page.
[14:21] <Shirik> I joined Wikipedia in the latter half of 2008, but I have been contributing since August 2008. I have over 5000 edits. I edit many varieties of articles, particularly Linux, Computer, and
[14:21] <Shirik> I'm going to assume that's unintentionally hidden and probably a browser issue
[14:21] <[Pmlineditor]> Shirik: It's crappy
[14:21] <[Pmlineditor]> (my userpage)
[14:21] <Shirik> chrome, despite its standards compliance, seems to disagree with other browers on some really technical things
[14:22] <Shirik> that text is like
[14:22] <Shirik> well, I just have to screenshot it
[14:22] <Shirik> I can't even describe it
[14:22] * [Pmlineditor] opens Chrome

[14:24] <Shirik> it was very difficult to highlight for copy-paste :P
[14:24] <[Pmlineditor]> Oh that

[14:33] * Ironholds has joined #wikipedia-en

[14:35] <Shirik> well that queue already exists
[14:35] <Shirik> just find it in the dropdown
[14:35] <MissAlyx> i cant see it..
[14:35] <MissAlyx> you sure its there ¬_¬?
[14:35] <Shirik> hang on, you're making me open huggle now...
[14:36] <Shirik> oh I guess only filtered non-anonymous exists
[14:36] <MissAlyx> T_T
[14:36] <MissAlyx> huggle just crashed
[14:36] <Shirik> however, I don't see a good reason to make anonymous only. Huggle prioritizes anonymous over non-anonymous under the filtered queue
[14:36] <MissAlyx> what the hell is this made in, vb6?
[14:37] <Shirik> .... sadly, VB.Net
[14:37] <Shirik> no comment
[14:37] <MissAlyx> Shirik: because anonymous edits are more likely to be vandalism :P
[14:37] * litherp2 has quit IRC (Remote closed the connection)
[14:37] <MissAlyx> when i recentchanges watch (manualy) i always make it anonymous edits only
[14:37] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: yes, but it already prioritises IPs
[14:37] <Shirik> but huggle already does that prioritizaiton for you
[14:37] <MissAlyx> yes, but i dont want it to show registered -at all-
[14:37] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: effectively, it's already there
[14:37] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: then use the direct recentchanges page?
[14:38] <MissAlyx> *effort*
[14:38] <Shirik> let me put it this way, MissAlyx, you are not fast enough to get anything other than "alerts" and anonymous
[14:38] <Shirik> non-alert non-anonymous you will not reach
[14:38] <Shirik> I promise :P
[14:38] <Shirik> I mean, you can definitely set up that queue if you want
[14:39] <MissAlyx> in the "add queue" tab in "filters" there IS a "anomyous" thing to click
[14:39] <Shirik> Huggle will lose it every time you start it up
[14:39] <Shirik> and then you get to recreate it
[14:39] <MissAlyx> yay
[14:39] <Shirik> at least that's what happens for me
[14:39] <MissAlyx> this is made almost as well as IE6 :P
[14:39] <Shirik> {{sofixit}} :)
[14:39] <MissAlyx> AAAARRRRSE
[14:39] <MissAlyx> all i did was click copy
[14:40] <MissAlyx> to copy the queue
[14:40] <MissAlyx> and it crashed AGAIN
[14:40] <Shirik> stop doing something complicated

[15:01] <MissAlyx> it does btecs :/
[15:01] <Ironholds> eww
[15:01] <MissAlyx> and btecs are crap.
[15:01] <Ironholds> what else do they do? in A-level terms
[15:01] <MissAlyx> law, goverment and politics :P
[15:01] <MissAlyx> .... dance
[15:01] <Ironholds> do G&P, I thoroughly enjoyed it
[15:01] <Ironholds> Law is an utter waste of time
[15:01] <MissAlyx> english, the 3 sciences, etc
[15:01] <Ironholds> yup
[15:02] <MissAlyx> i was tempted by G&P, which i could probably do
[15:02] <Algebraist> FM is an easy A
[15:02] <MissAlyx> the problem im having is
[15:02] * Algebraist hides
[15:02] <Ironholds> don't you have to do 4 AS levels down to 3 A-levels?
[15:02] <Aqwis> 3 sciences?
[15:02] <Aqwis> biology, physics and chem?
[15:02] <Ironholds> Aqwis: yup
[15:02] <MissAlyx> yeah
[15:02] <Aqwis> ah
[15:02] <Ironholds> so what's the problem?
[15:02] <Ironholds> with G&P
[15:02] <MissAlyx> like i said lastnight.. the school i go to forced me to do foundation level GCSEs.. so im gonna need to retake them all
[15:02] <Aqwis> I'd go for physics and chem ^_^
[15:02] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: ooh, shit
[15:03] <MissAlyx> i cant do maths, because i have a C in maths (the highest i could get on a foundation GCSE).. and im sure the G&P wanted atleast B's too
[15:03] <Ironholds> did they not let anyone do normal GCSEs?
[15:03] <MissAlyx> nope, all of us, foundation level
[15:03] <Ironholds> shit
[15:03] <Ironholds> you went to a crap school, matey
[15:03] <MissAlyx> because obviously we all work at the same pace and are all thick as horse shit.
[15:03] <MissAlyx> when we was preparing for the science papers, we was doing ones from past years.. and just for fun i thought i'd practice using the higher paper, i'd have got A* in science on the higher paper
[15:04] <MissAlyx> but they still made me do foundation limiting me at C
[15:04] <MissAlyx> ..
[15:04] <BWilkins> I think I'm glad I went to school in Canada LOL
[15:04] <Shirik> eh?
[15:04] <Algebraist> what, all schools in Canada are great?
[15:04] <BWilkins> No "Eh-levels" here LOL
[15:04] <MissAlyx> it isnt pronounced "Eh" O.o
[15:05] <Shirik> lol
[15:05] <BWilkins> You apparently don't know how to pronounce "Eh"
[15:05] <Ironholds> BWilkins: or you don't know how to pronounce A
[15:05] <MissAlyx> Eh is the sound you make if you are a chav and it's used in place of "What?"
[15:06] <Ironholds> considering we're the original speakers of English and you're essentially the bitch of an old biddy we keep locked in a castle, maybe you should stfu :P
[15:06] <MissAlyx> A is pronounced.. well...... A.....
[15:06] <Ironholds> how's this; keep quiet, I'll ask Liz to come visit you all one day
[15:06] <MissAlyx> Ayy, Bee, See, Dee, Eee, Eff, Jee..
[15:06] <Ironholds> you can scream like a little fan girl as you all do
[15:06] <BWilkins> LOL...no no no, it's them darned 'Mericans that can't speak or write the language
[15:06] <Aqwis> Eh, Bee, See
[15:06] <Aqwis> [...] Zed
[15:06] <Ironholds> BWilkins..yeah, speaking as both a Brit and a Canuck I will give you that
[15:07] <BWilkins> ..and we pronounce "Eh" as "A"
[15:07] <Ironholds> Aqwis: Ay, Bee, See, Dee, eee
[15:07] <Aqwis> surely "Ee" is sufficient
[15:07] <Ironholds> BWilkins: ahh. Are you sure it's just those southern bastards who pronounce English incorrectly? :P
[15:07] <BWilkins> It's horrific that some of my work gets "americanized" (real life work, that is)
[15:07] <Ironholds> Aqwis: not oop nort'
[15:07] <Ironholds> BWilkins: at least you know how to pronounce lieutenant, though.
[15:08] <Ironholds> "lieutenant" eurrrgh
[15:08] <Ironholds> it's LEF-TENANT!
[15:08] <BWilkins> The Canadian "accent" is the most desired in broadcast journalism for a reason LOL

[15:08] <MissAlyx> BBC English is most wanted
[15:08] <Ironholds> one of them was an FA a while back, I read it for luls
[15:08] <Aqwis> how often do you say "lieutenant" anyway?

[15:09] <White_Cat> why does english have the letter r
[15:09] <BWilkins> Probably.  Although at one point, 2 of the biggest 3 US anchormen were Canadians
[15:09] <Ironholds> and then it went downhill

[15:09] <White_Cat> Kirk was a canadian

[15:09] <Ironholds> Aqwis: hence why my friend Casey is not Casey, but McCarthey
[15:09] <White_Cat> wtf?
[15:09] <White_Cat> why ohio?
[15:09] <Aqwis> Ironholds, I didn't get that one.

[15:22] <Ironholds> Shirik: if you could write articles on every case and advisory opinion of the PCIJ using the grand total of no sources that you have, I would drive to your house and sell you my girlfriend
[15:22] <Shirik> Ironholds could probably do it -_-
[15:23] <Ironholds> Shirik: want me to make you feel worse? :P
[15:23] <Shirik> not really
[15:23] <Shirik> but you will anyway
[15:23] <Ironholds> I'm doing all this shit and still maintaining excellent university grades, a working social life, somebody willing to see me with my clothes off and not laugh and political activism
[15:23] <Ironholds> all thanks to the wonders of caffeine
[15:23] <Aqwis> on the other hand, you're an aspie

[15:24] <Ironholds> Aqwis: alright, alright
[15:24] <Ironholds> so I'm an ASPIE with a SOCIAL LIFE AND GIRLFRIEND
[15:24] <Ironholds> explain how that makes me less awesome rather than more
[15:24] <Ironholds> Algebraist: thank you. I'm only technically a lawyer
[15:24] <Aqwis> your girlfriend is an aspie too? ;)
[15:24] <Ironholds> by which I mean I'm a barrister, if you hold your thumb in front of the word on my GI card "student"
[15:24] <Ironholds> Aqwis: nein
[15:25] <Ironholds> her only fault is poor taste in boyfriends
[15:26] <Aqwis> it's not poor taste, it's an aspie fetish
[15:27] <Ironholds> na, it's poor taste
[15:27] <Ironholds> otherwise she'd be with a good looking aspie, think about it
[15:27] <Aqwis> I don't know how you look so I can't say

[15:29] <Ironholds> that was just because I carry a can of coke with me everywhere
[15:29] <Ironholds> or was it the twitching facial muscles and constant trips to the loo that did it
[15:30] <Algebraist> mostly the jittering
[15:30] <Aqwis> I googled Ironholds and found this: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Lord_Kitchener_AWM_A03547.jpg/180px-Lord_Kitchener_AWM_A03547.jpg
[15:30] <Ironholds> ahh
[15:30] <Aqwis> I'm going to assume that is you
[15:30] <Ironholds> Aqwis: yes
[15:30] <Algebraist> yeah, that's him
[15:30] <Ironholds> as you can see, I am the resurrected form of Lord Kitchener
[15:30] <Aqwis> you look a bit like Stalin, you know
[15:30] <Ironholds> My wallet needs YOU!
[15:30] <Ironholds> now give me your money, I'm poor
[15:30] <Algebraist> you mean he's wearing a uniform and a moustache?
[15:31] <Ironholds> My uniform looks completely different from that kthx
[15:31] <Ironholds> and I have no moustache. Rule 98
[15:31] <Shirik> Ironholds, what major?
[15:31] <Ironholds> Shirik: no, Kitchener was a Field Marshal
[15:31] <Ironholds> har har
[15:31] <Shirik> what major in school!
[15:31] <Algebraist> he must've been a major some time, right?
[15:32] <Shirik> ~lart Ironholds
[15:32] <Ironholds> Shirik: When I was at school, I studied mathematics, history, government and politics and philosophy
[15:32] <Ironholds> does that answer your question?
[15:33] <Ironholds> or were you intending to ask "What are you majoring in at the university you attend"?
[15:34] <Shirik> yes
[15:34] <Shirik> ...
[15:34] <Ironholds> well now we've all learned something
[15:34] <Ironholds> mainly, PHRASE QUESTIONS PROPERLY WOMAN
[15:34] <Algebraist> you have majors in the ATC?
[15:34] <Ironholds> Algebraist: no, since it's RAF-based
[15:34] <Algebraist> that's what I thought
[15:34] <Ironholds> so it went (effectively) FL, SL, WC, GC
[15:35] <MissAlyx> any way i can make huggle queue up edits with the repeating characters tag?
[15:35] <Algebraist> so major is SL?
[15:35] <Shirik> Pardon me, Ironholds, might I inquire as to what the major was for which you were registered at the university which you attend?
[15:35] <Ironholds> I assume there were pilot and flying officers about, but I never met any,
[15:35] <Ironholds> err, lets work it out
[15:35] <Ironholds> hard to say
[15:35] <Ironholds> because army is SL, LT, CP iirc, so we have an extra rank at the beginning
[15:36] <Shirik> no MissAlyx, but there's talk about that on WT:EF right now
[15:36] <Ironholds> but in the ATC, I guess the closest to Major would be WC
[15:36] <MissAlyx> right..
[15:36] <Shirik> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:EF#Question.2FProposal
[15:36] <MissAlyx> its just that "Tag" does appear to be an option, you just cant specify.. WHAT tag :P
[15:36] * tombom has quit IRC (Read error: 101 (Network is unreachable))
[15:36] <Ironholds> so it'd be Flight Lieutenant, Squadron Leader, Wing Commander on the one hand and Lieutenant, Captain, Major on the other. Unless the army equivalent uses Second Lieutenants
[15:36] <Ironholds> in which case it'd be WC, yes
[15:36] <Ironholds> Shirik: I started off doing politics, then added some law modules
[15:36] <Ironholds> then more law modules

[15:37] <Ironholds> and now I have absolutely no flipping clue. It could actually be a QLD

[15:38] <Ironholds> what do you do now, then?
[15:39] <Algebraist> not much at present
[15:39] <Ironholds> ohh, so you ARE a student :P
[15:39] <Algebraist> honorary
[15:40] <Algebraist> well done on not calling it a PhD, btw
[15:40] <Algebraist> many fall for that trap
[15:40] <Ironholds> by virtue of not doing much and therefore qualifying the first of the three Pillars of Studentship
[15:40] <Ironholds> Algebraist: the institute of your choice has funny naming systems. I am aware of those.
[15:40] <Algebraist> like using English when you least expect it
[15:40] <Ironholds> yes
[15:40] <Ironholds> and giving degrees ridiculous names
[15:40] <Ironholds> the law masters at Oxford, for example
[15:40] <Ironholds> BCL! IT MAKES NO SENSE!

[15:42] <Ironholds> another thing that annoys me
[15:42] <Ironholds> Bloke at oxford does a doctorate, goes to teach at Cambridge
[15:42] <Ironholds> Cambridge award him a PhD or DPhil depending. WHY.
[15:43] <Algebraist> do you know about degree incorporation?
[15:43] <Ironholds> yes
[15:43] <Ironholds> I know how it works, I just find it utterly infuriating
[15:43] <White_Cat> degrees are for pussies
[15:43] <Algebraist> it's rather mysterious
[15:43] <Ironholds> you get paid to be given a free degree. riiight.

[15:43] <White_Cat> -_-;
[15:43] <Ironholds> I assume it started as a matter of pride
[15:44] <Ironholds> "oh, we can't have one of THEM teaching here, and we're JUST as good. So we'll award him an equivalent degree from us, that way we can say he's ours"
[15:44] <Ironholds> or similar
[15:44] <Algebraist> hey, I wonder if the queen's created my degree yet
[15:44] <Shirik> ok, because Ironholds is going to destroy me in content, I'm going to go to sleep and then blame my lack of DYKs on needed sleep

[16:02] <Ironholds> one day you must come to London and see Slimelight
[16:03] <Ironholds> or, at the other end of the spectrum - When I visited Edinburgh, Shimgray took me to the Auld House, which is apparently well known for its alt music. Not a club, merely a pub, but good nonetheless

[16:36] <Ironholds> its true
[16:37] <Ironholds> he's got a long string of warnings, up to a final one, for vandalism and adding unreferenced content
[16:37] <Ironholds> he's then been making assertations that "most autistic people are 100 percent heterosexual" and "[autistics] are 100% heterosexual so they cannot be gay."
[16:37] <Ironholds> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Durex24
[16:38] <[Soap]> heh
[16:38] <[Soap]> tbh I dont think that's blockable, but I wont object to it either
[16:39] <[Soap]> mostly because he seems to have legitimate edits mixed with the vandalism and OR assertions
[16:41] <Ironholds> Soap: a single legit edit
[16:41] <Ironholds> and MisterWiki has shown, if nothing else, that good edits does not excuse dicking around
[16:42] <TheGrimReaperNS> I never knew 10 years were part of the block function.
[16:42] <TheGrimReaperNS> Until now.
[16:43] <[Soap]> :]
[16:43] <J_Milburn> Ironholds: Finished your review
[16:43] <J_Milburn> Will now look into this chap
[16:44] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: thanks kindly
[16:44] <Ironholds> TheGrimReaper: you can block somebody for any length of time
[16:44] * Qcoder00 has joined #Wikipedia-en
[16:44] <J_Milburn> I think I'd be more annoyed to be blocked for ten years than indefinitely
[16:44] <Ironholds> there was a lolzy diff I saw a while back where it was "11 months, 24 days, 13 hours, 5 minutes" and so on
[16:44] <Qcoder00> J_Milburn: Hi

[16:44] <Qcoder00> Sorry for leaving a lot of messages on your talk page
[16:45] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: I think that if you're given a final warning, a FINAL warning and a FINAL FINAL warning and react by calling admins Nazis, you deserve it
[16:45] <IShadowed> I need to speak with an admin
[16:45] * ceranthor has joined #wikipedia-en
[16:45] <J_Milburn> My old school's IP got blocked for 3.147 days for vandalism of [[Pi]]

[16:45] <Aqwis> huh?
[16:45] <Aqwis> where does the 7 come from?
[16:45] <Qcoder00> J_milburn: Busy?
[16:46] <Ironholds> I thought it was 3.151?

[16:46] <Ironholds> ahh

[16:48] <[Soap]> good mroning Mr Wiki
[16:48] <Ironholds> J_Milburn: thanks kindly, I'm just correcting bits now
[16:48] <Ironholds> speak of the devil
[16:48] <TheGrimReaperNS> Good morning, (long list of all users on channel).
[16:48] <MisterWiki> Good morning [Soap]
[16:48] <MissAlyx> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_Forever?diff=338368170 << That edit, was I right to revert that?
[16:48] <MissAlyx> i need an opinion, now, preferably
[16:49] <Ironholds> probably yes
[16:49] <MissAlyx> Ironholds: was that at me?
[16:49] <closedmouth|mst> it's been seven hours and sixteen days
[16:49] <MisterWiki> yes, MissAlyx.
[16:49] <[Soap]> yes
[16:49] <closedmouth|mst> since you took your love away
[16:49] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: yes
[16:49] <MissAlyx> because err
[16:49] <MissAlyx> i rollbacked it.. and then he edited it in again.. >.>
[16:49] <MissAlyx> so...
[16:49] <MissAlyx> i backed it again
[16:50] <MissAlyx> and now its back again
[16:50] <TheGrimReaperNS> Good morning MisterWiki, Soap, IssAlyx, Ironholds, IShadowed, ClosedMouth, QCoder00, and J_Milburn.
[16:50] <MissAlyx> and i dont wanna do it again incase im not supposed to >.>
[16:50] <MisterWiki> Good Morning TheGrimReaperNS
[16:50] <Qcoder00> have you hit 3 reverts?
[16:50] <Qcoder00> I tend to work 2 reverts and refer to admin
[16:50] <[Soap]> well, to be honest, Im not a big fan of rollback as a tool to win a content dispute.  That's borderline vandalism, but not really true vandalism in my opinion
[16:50] <MissAlyx> [Soap]: thats why im not touching it right now
[16:50] <Ironholds> oh bugger
[16:50] <[Soap]> and Huggle, by definition, is rollback
[16:50] <ceranthor> Who said it? BWilkins I believe
[16:50] <Ironholds> it's someone being moronic
[16:51] <ceranthor> Something like "If you're not sure its vandalism, don't revert it!"
[16:51] <MissAlyx> when i first did it, i was very sure its vandalism, and when i did it the 2nd time
[16:51] <MissAlyx> but vandals normally give up >.>
[16:51] <J_Milburn> Ironholds: Not willing to block right now. Could you show me an act of obvious vandalism/not wantery from after the last warning?
[16:51] <MissAlyx> so now im doubting myself
[16:51] <MissAlyx> well..
[16:52] <MissAlyx> he did put a source for it this time..
[16:52] <MissAlyx> http://www.3drealms.com/duke4/index.html
[16:52] <MissAlyx> "The release date of this game is "When it's done"."
[16:52] <MisterWiki> MissAlyx: 11:46, 17 January 2010 68.219.194.19 (talk) (48,413 bytes) (It is not unconstructive, I added a source to prove it!) (undo)
[16:52] <MissAlyx> that mean it stays?
[16:52] <MissAlyx> yeah, i know, i saw it
[16:52] <MissAlyx> huggle didnt show any sources until the 3rd time :|
[16:52] <ceranthor> Just from the looks of it, that source doesn't look too reliable
[16:53] <MisterWiki> Yeah.
[16:53] <MissAlyx> well, the entire department got sacked :/
[16:53] <MissAlyx> surely "Unknown" is good enough
[16:53] <MissAlyx> without "when its done"
[16:53] <ceranthor> Yes
[16:53] * closedmouth|mst is now known as closedmouth
[16:53] <ceranthor> To be released
[16:53] * Majorly has joined #wikipedia-en
[16:53] <MissAlyx> TBA!
[16:53] <MissAlyx> perfect, TBA
[16:53] <MissAlyx> like all other movies and games without a release date, it should be TBA..

[16:54] <MisterWiki> :)
[16:54] <J_Milburn> Qcoder, no remove it
[16:54] <MisterWiki> Qcoder00: Place a {{reduce}} template
[16:54] <Qcoder00> Consdering that
[16:55] <MisterWiki> John Scott Biddle (June 7, 1925 - October 1, 2008) was the world’s foremost yachting cinematographer and lecturer, forging a career that spanned more than forty years.
[16:55] <Qcoder00> J_milburn: The image concerned is a re-upload of one I called the uploader on a missing rationale
[16:55] <MisterWiki> "was the world's"?
[16:55] <Qcoder00> MisterWiki: The image isn't too big
[16:55] <MisterWiki> The image is too large
[16:55] <Qcoder00> So I don't think it's needs {{reduce}}
[16:55] <MisterWiki> And the infobox uses a 200px thumb
[16:56] <Qcoder00> 640x480 is OK
[16:56] <Qcoder00> And the image is smaller than that
[16:56] <MisterWiki> Mmm.
[16:57] <ceranthor> the world's is redundant
[16:57] <MisterWiki> Qcoder00: The fair use images should be not bigger than his most large thumb
[16:57] <Ironholds> J_Milburn, tweaked and made some GAN comments
[16:58] <Qcoder00> J_Milburn:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:John_Biddle.jpg  is a duplicate that didn';t have a rationale
[16:58] <J_Milburn> Ironholds: With you shortly
[16:58] <J_Milburn> Qcoder: Looking
[16:58] <Ironholds> ta
[16:59] <Ironholds> I've got to pop off to the LibDem HQ in a few minutes, so I'll do it when I come back
[16:59] <J_Milburn> Ironholds: Sure :)
[16:59] <J_Milburn> Qcoder: Leave it. It's gonna be legitimate once he moves it
[16:59] <J_Milburn> No need to fight over it
[16:59] <J_Milburn> Bigger fish to fry
[16:59] * MisterWiki cries
[16:59] <[Soap]> have fun popping off
[16:59] <Qcoder00> ironholds: Any chance of persuading the lib dem  PR and policy  people to release certain reports in a Wikisource compatible manner>
[17:00] <Qcoder00> ?
[17:00] <Ironholds> Qcoder: unlikely for the moment
[17:00] <Ironholds> MisterWiki, crocodile tears
[17:00] <Ironholds> Qcoder: I will look at our copyright status and the like when I'm at the Federal Conference in March, though
[17:00] <MissAlyx> if i want to get rid of the thing huggle put on the guys user page, do i just edit it out?
[17:00] <MisterWiki> -- You are now ignoring ironholds
[17:00] <Ironholds> MisterWiki: I'd be really hurt if I didn't think you were an immature little prick
[17:00] <MissAlyx> i want to take away one of the revertion notices :/
[17:01] <MissAlyx> aww, i like MisterWiki
[17:01] <Ironholds> MissAlyx: he's currently got a ten-year block. And you would.
[17:01] <[Soap]> me too, but we cant waive blocks because we like someone
[17:01] <Qcoder00> Ironholds: I was thinking more in terms of the parties hitorical material ( Turn of the Century 'Liberal' party stuff... if that's still tehcnicaly the Lib Dem's archive to license )
[17:01] <[Soap]> "eh, it's okay, youre my friend so go ahead and vandalize"
[17:01] <Qcoder00> than 'active'  current policy stuff
[17:01] <MisterWiki> With the Ironholds' help, everybody could get a 10 years block.
[17:01] <[Soap]> I think 10 years is excessive though
[17:01] <Ironholds> Qcoder: I'll take a look
[17:01] <Ironholds> but if it's really historic it should be PD
[17:02] <Ironholds> Soap: then we'll look at it again in 2
[17:02] <ceranthor> MisterWiki: If you're going to be a troll, leave.
[17:02] <MissAlyx> what did he do?
[17:02] <ceranthor> Now.
[17:02] <[Soap]> MrWiki, is there any wiki where you're not blocked, where you might like to edit?
[17:02] <TheGrimReaperNS> I remember one time when he helped me on a particularly vandalised article.But I agree with Soap.
[17:02] <MisterWiki> ceranthor: no.
[17:02] <[Soap]> or do you only want en?
[17:02] <MisterWiki> Yep.
[17:02] <Qcoder00> Ironholds: Stuff from 1900 might not be PD because UK terms are author +70
[17:02] <MisterWiki> I have 3 or 4 wikis.
[17:02] <MisterWiki> But I love to edit en.
[17:02] <Ironholds> Qcoder: true
[17:02] <Ironholds> Ceranthor: he's not really trolling
[17:02] <Ironholds> MisterWiki: use the past tense, please
[17:02] <Ironholds> loved. not love.
[17:02] <[Soap]> ok
[17:03] <ceranthor> "With the Ironholds' help, everybody could get a 10 years block"?
[17:03] <[Soap]> unless he's already got a sock ;)
[17:03] <Ironholds> Ceranthor: I don't want to block everyone, just a certain core group of people
[17:03] <Ironholds> most of whom are already indeffed
[17:03] <[Soap]> also
[17:04] <[Soap]> sorry to come a bit late to this, but
[17:04] <[Soap]> Duke Nukem Forever is STILL not ready?  I'd say it's pretty much cancelled

[17:17] <TheGrimReaperNS> You used CTCP?
[17:17] <Rjd0060> No.  Didn't have to.

[17:43] <[Soap]> they realized that it was actually encouraging people to make silly articles, I imagine
[17:43] * PeterSymonds has joined #wikipedia-en
[17:44] <[Soap]> I think that Uncyclopedia did not exist at the time, and that its original mission was to provide people a place to make BJAODN type pages without fear of deletion.  Uncycloepdia has changed a bit since then, though
[17:44] <[Soap]> imo, the "old" Uncyclopedia was better than what is there today
[17:44] <[Soap]> except for the articles that were created under the "old" spirit and are still there today
[17:45] <TheGrimReaperNS> Now it's full of swearing and stuff that just isn't funny.
[17:45] <MissAlyx> uncyclopedia is on wikia isnt it?

[17:46] <TheGrimReaperNS> I agree.
[17:47] <MissAlyx> they get away with it, i dont
[17:47] <MissAlyx> i cited an example of a page with the word "fuck" on about 30 times out of context, and they said its part of the "special agreement"
[17:48] <TheGrimReaperNS> Which special agreement? The one Wikia broken? With the domain name?
[17:48] <MissAlyx> the "they bring us loads of traffic so they can do whatever the hell they want" one :P

[17:54] <MissAlyx> huggle is sooooooooo .... crap.
[17:54] <MissAlyx> just got a message on my talk, it reverted someone elses revertion..
[17:55] <MissAlyx> i have huggle set to only show anonymous edits in the queue, and i REMEMBER seeing the edit in question.. and i undid it, and just continued with the queue.. and it turns out it undid the revertion someone had made of that edit :|
[17:55] <[Soap]> if this is your first day on Huggle, it might be a good idea to start slow
[17:55] <MissAlyx> it wasnt my fault, it was huggle O.o
[17:55] <[Soap]> well, I dont use Huggle, so I cant explain the situation
[17:56] <MissAlyx> i dont see registered edits, so it wouldnt have even shown up in my queue
[17:56] <[Soap]> but it seems to me that people who have used huggle for a long time and are experts at it dont commonly have problems like that
[17:56] <[Soap]> so there must be a way to prevent them
[17:56] <MissAlyx> well, its only about 1/90 thats done it
[17:56] <MissAlyx> i suspect the registered user reverted it at the same time i did.. between the time huggle checked, and reverted.. somehow :/

[17:59] <MissAlyx> actually, i think i DID do something different with that edit
[17:59] <[Soap]> it might be good to talk to someone who knows more about how to use Huggle and prevent malfunctions
[17:59] <MissAlyx> i think i actually used a button rather than a hotkey O.o
[17:59] <[Soap]> Like I said, I don't use it
[17:59] <MissAlyx> *checks*
[18:00] <MissAlyx> i think because of the unusual language i decided it wasnt worth a warning, and i just reverted it without a warning..
[18:00] <MissAlyx> which i havnt done on any other article
[18:01] <MissAlyx> http://imgkk.com/i/hRpJZm.png << most of en.wiki are atheist.. why does this not suprise me...
[18:01] <Aqwis> MissAlyx, correction: most of those with a "religion userbox" are atheist
[18:01] <MissAlyx> whatever :P
[18:01] <Aqwis> one would assume that people who are "casually christian" are less likely to have a userbox than atheists and hardcore christians
[18:01] <MissAlyx> theres no such thing as casually christian
[18:01] <Aqwis> sure there is
[18:02] <TheGrimReaperNS> Does anyone like the idea of this channel? ##wikipedia-dragons-otters
[18:02] <Aqwis> most of the Norwegian population, for example
[18:02] * Willking1979 has quit IRC
[18:03] <MissAlyx> theres no line between "murderer" and "not murderer", same applies to religion
[18:03] <MissAlyx> you cant mix and match
[18:03] <Aqwis> that's what you think
[18:03] <MissAlyx> you are either a murderer, or being tried as a murderer, ot not a murderer :P
[18:03] <Aqwis> but people do it anyway
[18:04] <MissAlyx> i sure hope im in that atheist category O.o
[18:04] <MissAlyx> i dont remember if i am
[18:04] <Aqwis> I don't have userboxes of that type on my userpage
[18:04] <TheGrimReaperNS> I do. A whole section of them.
[18:05] <MissAlyx> i have userboxs :P
[18:05] <Aqwis> all I've got are location boxes, babel boxes, admin box and inclusionist box
[18:05] <MissAlyx> and ive made some too
[18:05] <Aqwis> brb
[18:06] <MissAlyx> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TigerTails/UBX/Empty << I even have that!
[18:07] <MissAlyx> for user pages that require a degree of symmetry :P

[18:43] <MisterWiki> It will be reviewed by a volunteer.
[18:43] <Gigs> cool, I didn't know the link
[18:43] <MisterWiki> It is useful when your IP is blocked or when you can't read the captcha.
[18:43] <Gigs> yeah make sure to note you need the bit that bypasses IP blocks
[18:44] <Lady_Aleena> I thought creating an account got around IP blocks.

[19:07] <White_Cat> trust me survivors are traoumatised more.
[19:07] <White_Cat> the dead are gone and thats that
[19:07] <thedj> after they get pregnant they decided to go on with the adoption, because they were so far along
[19:07] <White_Cat> survivors will be scared for life.
[19:07] <thedj> now there is a parentless 6 month old :/

[19:16] <Josfox> * ce
[19:16] <White_Cat> the data transmission holds so little data

[19:16] <White_Cat> while abusing so much resources
[19:16] <Lady_Aleena> Josfox, fair enough.
[19:16] <White_Cat> Lady_Aleena everyone should communbicate through voice recognition based txt msgs
[19:16] <Orderinchaos> ive been abusing a bong
[19:17] <White_Cat> and text to speech

[19:17] <Lady_Aleena> White_Cat, why?
[19:17] <White_Cat> would use less badnwidth
[19:17] <White_Cat> would be backward compatible with "vocal cord" based communication modules
[19:19] <Orderinchaos> i am only on the phone cos im at a mate's place
[19:19] <Lady_Aleena> White_Cat, plain text has very little texture to it. A voice is nuanced. A voice can carry so much additional infomation that text just can't rival.

[19:39] <Josfox> lololol
[19:40] <Lollipop> I do have to doubt that, but it's not really that important imo
[19:40] <Lollipop> for what it's worth, Spanish speakers do say "pis" for piss although it's not the most common word
[19:40] <Lady_Aleena> Anything after the second "l" in "lol" makes no sense.
[19:40] <Lollipop> in fact to them it's more childish than anything

[19:41] <Josfox> ;)
[19:41] <Josfox> Close.
[19:41] <Lollipop> but I mean the non-euphemism one
[19:41] <Lollipop> gonna use wiktionary
[19:41] <KimiSleep> phew, just watched "Moon"
[19:41] <TheGrimReaperNS> That is the verb form: urinate.
[19:41] * Josfox shrugs
[19:41] <KimiSleep> I wanted it to be a proper scifi flick, but halfway through I didn't mind that it wasn't anymore
[19:41] <Lollipop> it's mear, apparently
[19:41] <Lollipop> meo, meas, mea, etc
[19:42] <Mister_Wiki> mear is the most common word
[19:43] <Mister_Wiki> but orinar is the correct
[19:43] <Mister_Wiki> mear is disrespectful
[19:43] <Lollipop> wait, I thought you left

I would have watched the new V; but because they remade it instead of continued the original, I am ignoring it like I did the newer Bionic Woman.

[20:09] <Josfox> Well yeh.
[20:09] <Golbez> GitS: Stand Alone Complex was really quite good.
[20:09] <Josfox> Like most anime.
[20:09] <Josfox> :P
[20:09] <[Soap]> i use mIRC, Mr Wiki
[20:09] <Lady_Aleena> The only Japanimation that I have is Starblazers on VHS which I may sell so that I can buy the DVDs since I don't have a VCR anymore.
[20:09] <[Soap]> I also sometimes use chatzilla, but not omn this network
[20:09] <[Soap]> didnt believe me, Reaper?
[20:09] <White_Cat> Lady_Aleena most original anime VHS are collectables
[20:09] <White_Cat> that may be a bargin
[20:10] <Golbez> It's a little weird that I've been using mIRC since before some people in this channel were born.
[20:10] <Lady_Aleena> Tried chatzilla, it is too messy.

[20:10] <Golbez> [Soap] - About 14 years now
[20:10] <Lady_Aleena> White_Cat, my copies aren't. They probably won't sell well.
[20:10] <White_Cat> it doesnt feel too much like anime.
[20:10] <[Soap]> ok
[20:10] <[Soap]> Ive been using mIRC since 1999
[20:11] <White_Cat> Lady_Aleena oooh
[20:11] <White_Cat> copyvio there
[20:11] <[Soap]> and I think the settings files on this PC actually go back to 1999 even though the computer itself is new
[20:11] <Lady_Aleena> White_Cat, they are not in their original shrink wrap and have been in a household of smokers for over a decade.
[20:11] <Golbez> I switched to mIRC in January 1996 because I was in #quake, and John Romero and John Carmack had just come in, and the flood of joins/parts/quits was too much in my old client, and someone suggested mIRC because it colorcodes everything. Made it so much easier to see when they announced the Quake test demo wasn't out yet. (It was another week) :P
[20:11] <Golbez> [Soap] - same, I've been carting around the same mirc directory since 1997 or so
[20:11] <White_Cat> the thing great about doctor who is that the ship is basicaly from the 80s
[20:11] <TheGrimReaperNS> [Soap]: What did your client say to you when I CTCPed you.
[20:11] <TheGrimReaperNS> *?
[20:12] <White_Cat> knobs and buttons
[20:12] <White_Cat> lately scifi is all about touchscreens
[20:12] <Golbez> man, I miss the old days of #quake and big giant internet releases like that. sigh.
[20:12] <White_Cat> which is actualy just cheap
[20:12] <Lady_Aleena> White_Cat, I know.
[20:12] <White_Cat> they are randomly touching a greenscreen
[20:12] <White_Cat> that creates the feel of artificialness
[20:13] <White_Cat> in tng for instance touch screens were actualy there
[20:13] <Lady_Aleena> And can one TV series please show safe driving techniques such as having the characters use blue tooth headsets instead of holding their damned cell phones to their ears while driving?

[20:15] <White_Cat> What I dont get is

[20:16] <Gigs> hehe
[20:16] <White_Cat> 24's first season was okay
[20:16] <White_Cat> then it went apeshit
[20:16] <TheGrimReaperNS> MisterWiki: Even though I openly advertise my usage of SeaMonkey, some may want their CTCP version to remain private. And don't CTCP "moarspam" in an endless loop to me please.
[20:16] <Golbez> Season 1 of 24 was great. It was the only one to really give the impression of the passage of time, that it really was taking place in a single day. It helped that, unlike every one since then, it started at midnight, so Jack had already been awake for a full day. They did a great job of changing the light and making him fatigued.
[20:17] <Golbez> Season 2 was pretty good as well, much more action-packed as many sequels are, but the last hour - becoming a 24 tradition - sucked. Season 3 sucked. It's been up and down since.
[20:17] <MisterWiki> TheGrimReaperNS: I did it just one time. :)

[20:19] <Lady_Aleena> Ottava, I watched the pilot of SGU and was disgusted.
[20:19] <Ottava> The story lines were okay
[20:19] <Ottava> but the random episodes were the best
[20:19] <Ottava> I like the exploration more than the drawn out events
[20:20] <Lady_Aleena> I can't believe that Carter/McKay were stumped so bad that they had to make a video game for someone to figure out that code. Give me a break.

[20:42] <Ottava> Hindus are atheists
[20:42] <Ottava> This is why we need to kill the infidels
[20:42] * Ottava stabs Alyx
[20:42] * AlephInfinity has quit IRC (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out))

[20:42] <KimiNewt> no they're not
[20:42] <MissAlyx> warning: err.. dont watch the video
[20:42] <Ottava> They don't believe in the one true god
[20:43] <MissAlyx> it will make you want to kill all religious people, right now.
[20:43] <KimiNewt> I see
[20:43] <MissAlyx> but i feel that all the time..
[20:43] <KimiNewt> Same, MissAlyx
[20:43] <[Soap]> you want to massacre all of India?
[20:43] <Krinkle> Golbez: So, it was not made by "en:User:Drz" under GFDL ?
[20:43] <Golbez> Krinkle - on sec

[20:43] <Golbez> one
[20:43] * TheGrimReaperNS watches as the world population goes down.
[20:44] <MissAlyx> theyre clearly less intelligent as a whole.. they believe in such bizarre and insane things...
[20:44] <Ottava> Soap - atheists don't care about life
[20:44] <MissAlyx> like, korea, they think fans kill you O.o
[20:44] <MisterWiki> This HAVE to be implemented : http://usability.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RefTools_UsabilityInitutive_Mockup.svg
[20:44] <Ottava> Intelligence is insulting the intelligence of 800 million people : )
[20:44] <MissAlyx> Ottava: because we realise life is EXTREMELY insignificant..
[20:44] <Ottava> If life is insignificant, kill yourself
[20:44] <MissAlyx> we are absolutely nothing, not even a speck of dust in the universe.
[20:45] <MissAlyx> we are unfathomably insignificant..
[20:45] <KimiNewt> oh shut it
[20:45] <Golbez> Drz uploaded .jpg at 9:47 central, Feb 20 2004. It was deleted on Jan 4 2005 for being a duplicate.
[20:46] <Golbez> Automated conversion bot uploaded .JPG on July 20, 2002. Drz uploaded a new version at 9:50 central, February 20 2004. It apparently? had no image page, because MBisanz created it on March 18, 2009, stating no license was given, and it was deleted on March 28 2009 for having no license.
[20:46] <MisterWiki> Hehehe.
[20:46] <Ottava> Alyx, just kill yourself
[20:46] <Ottava> Seriously
[20:46] <Ottava> it would do you good
[20:47] <Ottava> : )
[20:47] <[Soap]> a file called .jpg ?
[20:47] <Golbez> Now, to look at commons.
[20:47] <TheGrimReaperNS> Ottava: No personal attacks.
[20:47] <MisterWiki> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:.jpg
[20:47] <Ottava> Grim - its not a personal attack
[20:47] <Ottava> its called calling a bluff
[20:47] <Golbez> [Soap] - no, we're talking about File:Cartesiancoordinates3D.jpg vs File:Cartesiancoordinates3D.JPG
[20:47] <KimiNewt> Out to conquer commons, he later uploaded .gif and .svg
[20:47] <MisterWiki> Ottava: [[WP:NPA]]
[20:47] <Ottava> Alyx actually is too egotistical to really believe they are worthless
[20:47] <[Soap]> wow
[20:47] <Ottava> : D
[20:47] <[Soap]> looks at all those pages linking to nothing
[20:47] <Golbez> neither .jpg nor .JPG appear on commons.
[20:47] <KimiNewt> Thus only having .png parting him from true world image domination
[20:47] <[Soap]> it seems to be due to people making pages from templates without filling them in
[20:48] <[Soap]> e.g
[20:48] <[Soap]> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tran_Duc_Cuong
[20:48] <Krinkle> Golbez: Sorry, could you do that same one-liner for the .JPG ?
[20:48] <KimiNewt> A file with this name was previously uploaded, but has been deleted. 
[20:48] <Ottava> Soap - You mean Dr Blofield?
[20:48] <Krinkle> oh nvm, i missed it.
[20:48] <Golbez> Krinkle - same one-liner? you mean the history of it? I did, just below the .jpg one
[20:48] <Krinkle> :)
[20:48] <Golbez> However, these are for en.pedia. I don't see the images in commons' history at all.
[20:48] <KimiNewt> Damn you, Dr. Blofield!
[20:48] <KimiNewt> I am sick and tired cleaning up after his damn stubs!
[20:49] <Krinkle> Golbez: Why would there be something on Commons ?
[20:49] <Golbez> Krinkle - I misunderstood what you meant about nlwiki, I thought you meant that the image had disappeared off nlwiki because of the deletion. Never mind that, then. :)
[20:49] <MisterWiki> KimiNewt: Request Block!
[20:49] <TheGrimReaperNS> On who?
[20:49] <KimiNewt> No.
[20:50] <KimiNewt> Also
[20:50] <KimiNewt> On [[Red links
[20:50] <KimiNewt> I am vehemently against redlinkophobia. Red links serve the useful purpose of alerting users to content that needs to be developed. They should never be de-linked just because they are red. The only valid reason, in my mind, to eliminate a red link is to turn it blue. Or, less likely, if the object never should have been a link in the beginning.
[20:50] <Krinkle> Golbez: There currently is an image from 2004 on nl.wiki that was template'ed MTC (move to commons) by some user. So I checked it out. On the nl.wiki page it stated it was a derivative work of the image we're discussing on en.wiki
[20:50] <KimiNewt> crap
[20:50] <KimiNewt> Premature pasting
[20:50] <Golbez> Krinkle - Ah.
[20:50] <KimiNewt> On [[User:Abyssal]] it said the forementioned
[20:51] <Krinkle> Golbez: So I'm kinda doubting what I should do
[20:51] <Krinkle> Hm.. it seems File:Coord system CA 0.svg @ Commons is far better.
[20:51] <KimiNewt> Yet he made hundreds of amphibian stubs containing naught but "X is a prehistoric amphibian."
[20:51] <MisterWiki> MissAlyx: Is this you?
[20:51] <MisterWiki> http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Introduction&diff=prev&oldid=43037072
[20:51] <Krinkle> I'll replace the use of the file with that one, and delete due to invalid derivative source
[20:51] <MisterWiki> Is reeally scaring.
[20:51] <Krinkle> Thx for your time Golbez :)
[20:51] <Golbez> np :)
[20:51] <Krinkle> ( it was also badJPEG )
[20:51] <KimiNewt> Sometimes having the helpful taxobox telling us it's in the class Amphibia!

[20:55] <MissAlyx> MisterWiki: Solution - get better antivirus
[20:55] <MissAlyx> like NOD32
[20:55] <MisterWiki> NOD32
[20:55] <MisterWiki> Lol
[20:55] <KimiNewt> like: being smart
[20:55] <MisterWiki> Don't make me 'lol'
[20:55] <MisterWiki> TY.
[20:55] <Shirik> Solution: Don't rely on antivirus software
[20:55] <TheGrimReaperNS> There is no virus present on my PC and I use SeaMonkey.
[20:55] <KimiNewt> Highfive, Shirik
[20:55] <MissAlyx> NOD32 often comes highest in comparatives, or did in 09 anyway
[20:55] * Krinkle has left #wikipedia-en
[20:56] <KimiNewt> well 09 was SEVENTEEN DAYS AGO wasn't it
[20:56] <MissAlyx> it just runs neatly in the background and i never touch it
[20:56] <MissAlyx> KimiNewt: ill check the latest one :P

[20:56] * MrZ-man has joined #wikipedia-en
[20:56] <KimiNewt> I use no antivirus

[20:57] <MissAlyx> if you dont have antivirus
[20:57] * MisterWiki turned down Avast
[20:57] <MisterWiki> Hahahaha.
[20:57] <MisterWiki> Good one MissAlyx
[20:57] <KimiNewt> I would notice?
[20:57] <MissAlyx> no you wouldnt
[20:57] <KimiNewt> It's not like I don't check what's running once in a while
[20:57] <MissAlyx> when nod32 detects stuff, its totally out of the blue, i dont notice it until it tells me its there
[20:57] <TheGrimReaperNS> I did when my PC was infected. And the antivirus shown nothing.
[20:58] <MissAlyx> you can hide processes from task manager
[20:58] <KimiNewt> Sure
[20:58] <KimiNewt> But if it's infected and doesn't have any symptoms
[20:58] <KimiNewt> I don't really care?
[20:58] <MissAlyx> it could be using your internet connection to download child porn..
[20:58] <KimiNewt> There's no info I wish to hide in here
[20:58] <KimiNewt> Doubt it
[20:58] <MissAlyx> and keylogging, obviously
[20:58] <KimiNewt> I would have noticed
[20:58] <KimiNewt> Keylogging wouldn't help it
[20:59] <KimiNewt> Unless it wishes to vandalise wikipedia in my name or whatever
[20:59] <MissAlyx> you must enter passwords at some point
[20:59] <TheGrimReaperNS> MissAlyx: There is a reply waiting at your private chat window.
[20:59] <KimiNewt> Yes
[20:59] <MissAlyx> and passwords are often sent unencrypted anyway, so it could just catch it as it goes out
[20:59] <KimiNewt> look it's not infected and that's that

[21:01] <KimiNewt> Just kidding
[21:01] <KimiNewt> I haven't read it

[21:02] <KimiNewt> It's probably awesome, but I don't want to read it anyway

[21:06] <KimiNewt> Haha yeah I noticed that
[21:07] <KimiNewt> He totally has a hard-on for them
[21:07] <[Soap]> I have read that book
[21:07] <KimiNewt> Like when he goes on about how they're probably more intelligent than all of us
[21:07] <shimgray> and... well, Diamond sounds good but is a bit flaky. it's a book to take with a pinch of salt.

[21:09] <MissAlyx> i want to kill him.
[21:09] <MissAlyx> hes so stupid.
[21:09] * Diego_Grez is /me
[21:09] * Diego_Grez is Ottava
[21:09] <MissAlyx> how can he POSSIBLY think that is a good idea
[21:09] <Ottava> If nothing matters, why is Alyx so anxious about religion?
[21:09] <Ottava> Kinda contradictory
[21:09] <KimiNewt> There is no totally secular state here
[21:09] <White_Cat> so Lady_Aleena what do you think of NASA
[21:09] <Diego_Grez> She's atheist, Ottava.
[21:09] <KimiNewt> What does that have to do with anything?
[21:09] <White_Cat> more so their last space program to put a man on the moon
[21:09] <Ottava> Diego - she claimed nothing mattered
[21:09] <White_Cat> probably a woman too
[21:09] <Ottava> he
[21:09] <Ottava> Whatever
[21:09] <KimiNewt> So is pretty much everyone here Diego_Grez?
[21:09] <Ottava> MA
[21:09] <Ottava> ;/
[21:09] * mikehotel86 /me
[21:10] <Lady_Aleena> White_Cat, good idea, bad implementation. It should be in the private sector which would manage it better.
[21:10] <Ottava> Actually, there are 7 Catholics who participate in this chat
[21:10] <MissAlyx> i wanna go to the moon :O
[21:10] <Ottava> and a few protestants
[21:10] <Ottava> and a couple jews
[21:10] <Diego_Grez> I'm atheist too.
[21:10] <KimiNewt> White_Cat - what are you speaking of?
[21:10] <KimiNewt> There is still no plan..
[21:10] <Ottava> but one protestant jew
[21:10] <MissAlyx> Ottava: and i try to ignore them all.
[21:10] <KimiNewt> It's still under review
[21:10] <Ottava> and by that, I mean Ironholds, who would delight in me calling him that
[21:10] <Ottava> ;/
[21:10] <White_Cat> Lady_Aleena man on the moon is too expensive for the private sector
[21:10] <KimiNewt> I'm a jew by heredity
[21:10] <White_Cat> virgin galactic can barely go to orbit
[21:10] <mikehotel86> A Muslim too
[21:10] <KimiNewt> they don't intend to go to orbit
[21:10] <Lady_Aleena> Ottava, specificity please on Catholics.
[21:10] <KimiNewt> spaceX will get to orbit this marchish
[21:10] <KimiNewt> Bigelow will have shit up soon
[21:10] <Ottava> Specificity?
[21:10] <Ottava> About what?
[21:10] <MissAlyx> i agree with Lady_Aleena
[21:10] <Ottava> Name who they are?
[21:10] <KimiNewt> They're racing far further than NASA ever could
[21:11] <Lady_Aleena> White_Cat, I don't think so, if the private sector wants it, it would happen.
[21:11] <KimiNewt> But it's far until they overtake NASA
[21:11] <KimiNewt> But the private sector doesn't want it
[21:11] <KimiNewt> Bigelow and Galactic are driven by tourism
[21:11] <White_Cat> Lady_Aleena the problem with space travel is how unreusable space craft is
[21:11] <Ottava> I don't know what "specificity on Catholics" would mean?
[21:11] <KimiNewt> SpaceX is driven by the goverment and sat contractors
[21:11] <Lady_Aleena> I do think that we need to clean up with mess on Earth first before we inhabit other planets.
[21:11] <White_Cat> the shuttle was a step in the right direction
[21:11] <White_Cat> but it was the only step since the 70s
[21:11] <MissAlyx> http://www.google.co.uk/dictionary?aq=f&langpair=en|en&hl=en&q=specificity
[21:11] <KimiNewt> SpaceX's Dragon and Falcon 9 are partly reusable, White_Cat
[21:11] <White_Cat> a repacement was never seriously considered
[21:11] <MissAlyx> you bloody christian types.
[21:11] <KimiNewt> the Shuttle was horribly expensive
[21:11] <White_Cat> like windows xp if it works why upgrade?
[21:12] <Lady_Aleena> Ottava, there are Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox for starters. :)
[21:12] <KimiNewt> and didn't fulfil its original duty
[21:12] <KimiNewt> mainly because of the changes the disasters induced
[21:12] <Ottava> Eastern Orthodox aren't Catholics
[21:12] <Ottava> they are Orthodox

[21:12] <White_Cat> KimiNewt the soyuz and appollo are not usable at all
[21:12] * Diego_Grez uses Windows 98
[21:12] <KimiNewt> reusable
[21:12] <KimiNewt> True
[21:12] <MissAlyx> Ottava: theyre just as delusional
[21:12] <White_Cat> *apollo
[21:12] <MissAlyx> so it doesnt matter
[21:12] <KimiNewt> Soyuz is much more reliable than just about anything?
[21:12] * Diego_Grez lies
[21:12] <Lady_Aleena> Ottava, they are still part of the uber-Catholic church.
[21:12] <White_Cat> nasas plan for moon is also not usable
[21:12] <KimiNewt> Only one accident ever
[21:12] <White_Cat> Soyuz isnt reliable
[21:12] <KimiNewt> do you mean reusable?
[21:12] <Ottava> Lady Alenna - that is catholic church, not Catholic Church
[21:13] <KimiNewt> It isn't?

[21:13] <Diego_Grez> mikehotel86: stop doing that, it's annoying
[21:13] <KimiNewt> So?
[21:13] <KimiNewt> It's still reliable
[21:13] <White_Cat> soyuz uses a parachute to land
[21:13] <White_Cat> if that fails
[21:13] <White_Cat> it'd be dead
[21:13] <KimiNewt> ..power descent
[21:13] <KimiNewt> powered*

[21:14] <White_Cat> yes
[21:14] <KimiNewt> and only one accident really
[21:14] <White_Cat> or so we know
[21:14] <mikehotel86> I am trying to get used to cell phone app here. Can you please tell me how my last message appeared?
[21:14] <KimiNewt> ..oh please
[21:14] <White_Cat> soyuz lacks a cargo bay
[21:14] <White_Cat> so its an old obsolite craft
[21:14] * Diego_Grez still uses floppies.
[21:14] <White_Cat> my 386 still runs
[21:14] <KimiNewt> That's not even how you spell that but anyway
[21:14] <White_Cat> doesnt mean its reliable
[21:14] <KimiNewt> They want to change that
[21:14] <KimiNewt> But I don't think that's the best choice
[21:15] <KimiNewt> Soyuz does what it's meant to do
[21:15] <KimiNewt> and it does it well
[21:15] <Lady_Aleena> White_Cat, I think all the money going into the space programs around the world should be redirected to solving the social issues we have on Earth. Only when we have total employment worldwide, poverty is eliminated, the population is under strict control, and wars are held in conference rooms only, should we think about going into space and inhabiting other planets in this system.
[21:15] <White_Cat> yes
[21:15] <KimiNewt> and relatively cheaply 
[21:15] <KimiNewt> Lady_Aleena - Joke post?
[21:15] <White_Cat> Lady_Aleena actualy space exploration can help with all that
[21:15] <KimiNewt> Quick answer:
[21:15] <KimiNewt> Problems will never be solved
[21:15] <White_Cat> most of worlds problem is over land or resources
[21:15] <KimiNewt> We go to space because we want to, so fuck you guys
[21:15] <KimiNewt> basically
[21:16] <White_Cat> the middle east problems would be solved instantly if no one relied on oil anymore
[21:16] <KimiNewt> ..um

[21:16] <KimiNewt> not really?
[21:16] * mikehotel86 /me
[21:16] <White_Cat> the moon has helium 3 which could eliminate/reduce oil use significantly
[21:16] <KimiNewt> ...
[21:16] <KimiNewt> Stop watching so much scifi
[21:16] <Lady_Aleena> KimiNewt, no I am not joking. We need to clean up all of the social issues this planet has so we don't trash the solar system. We do not belong in space yet.
[21:16] * mikehotel86 has quit IRC (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
[21:16] <KimiNewt> there is nothing saying he-3 can be a truly viable form of energy resource
[21:16] <KimiNewt> That's bullcrap aleena
[21:16] <KimiNewt> We can't fix it
[21:17] <KimiNewt> And basically I think that any spacefaring society
[21:17] <KimiNewt> will probably be doing better than the trash in here
[21:17] <White_Cat> Lady_Aleena fixing the world requies the g-8 nations to stop acting like colonial nations
[21:17] <KimiNewt> because let's face it, the ones going up there are the ones that are already the elite
[21:17] <KimiNewt> and the ones going will be the elite humans of the elite countries
[21:17] <White_Cat> consider how japan became a g-8 nation
[21:17] <White_Cat> despite being nuked twice
[21:17] <KimiNewt> We can't fix the earth but we can make a fixed earth elsewhere maybe?
[21:18] <Lady_Aleena> KimiNewt, all we need is strict population control worldwide. Until this planet can sustain its population, we shoud not go into space again.
[21:18] <KimiNewt> Meh
[21:18] <White_Cat> a good chunk of the planet relies on aid to survive
[21:18] <KimiNewt> Look
[21:18] <White_Cat> they dont have a stable economy
[21:18] <KimiNewt> There are loads of arguements against that
[21:18] <White_Cat> thats actualy very very bad for business
[21:18] * mikehotel86 has joined #wikipedia-en
[21:18] <White_Cat> Lady_Aleena population control is vital
[21:18] <KimiNewt> Including space inducing more jobs, may somehow allow us further energy, further territory &c.
[21:18] <KimiNewt> But honestly
[21:18] <White_Cat> best way to do that is through education
[21:18] <KimiNewt> I think what happens is that people want to go to space
[21:19] <KimiNewt> so they tell other people that it's good for them
[21:19] <KimiNewt> and that's it
[21:19] <Ottava> If population control is vital, people thinking it is necessary can be the first to kill themselves
[21:19] <Ottava> and solve the problem
[21:19] <White_Cat> Lady_Aleena in a year people spend more money on cosmetics than space exploration
[21:19] <Lady_Aleena> KimiNewt, then put space exploration strictly in the private sector.
[21:19] <KimiNewt> Private sector will never get anything
[21:19] <mikehotel86> Me
[21:19] <KimiNewt> Or rather, a hell of a lot more slowly
[21:19] <White_Cat> Lady_Aleena I also am not a big fan of the private sector
[21:20] <KimiNewt> Since private sector needs some sort of economic incentive
[21:20] <White_Cat> private sector tends to get greedy
[21:20] <KimiNewt> Tourism isn't enough
[21:20] <White_Cat> look at how some companies operate
[21:20] * mikehotel86 /me
[21:20] <Lady_Aleena> Ottava, I am not going to have children to help with population control.
[21:20] <Ottava> Oh gesh
[21:20] * mikehotel86 /me hp
[21:20] <White_Cat> Lady_Aleena we can have your children :)
[21:20] <KimiNewt> and the private sector isn't going to help science
[21:20] <KimiNewt> it's not gonig to selflessly spend billions so we can expand our shared knowledge
[21:20] <mikehotel86> Is
[21:21] <Lady_Aleena> KimiNewt, I am one who is for less government.
[21:21] <White_Cat> KimiNewt any serious company has serious RnD
[21:21] <White_Cat> but for things they can sell
[21:21] <White_Cat> like a new washing machine
[21:21] <KimiNewt> Yes
[21:21] <KimiNewt> not for things like how the moon was formed

[21:22] * mikehotel86 has joined #wikipedia-en
[21:22] <White_Cat> KimiNewt sony's most serious expansion was over gaming
[21:22] <White_Cat> something not realy helping science
[21:22] <Diego_Grez> Any esperanto speaker here?
[21:22] <White_Cat> but provides mountain loads of profit
[21:23] <White_Cat> sony will not just build a space shuttle to expand
[21:23] <White_Cat> KimiNewt I dont do much, what do you mean?
[21:23] <KimiNewt> like a job
[21:23] <mikehotel86> Ok sorry. I am done experimenting.
[21:23] <KimiNewt> you seem a bit daft no offense
[21:23] <White_Cat> I am unemployed
[21:23] <mikehotel86> Me too
[21:23] <Lady_Aleena> White_Cat, what if Sony wants to provide a 0 gee gaming experience? The best place for it is in space. :)
[21:24] <White_Cat> or I could say I am unoccupied.
[21:24] <White_Cat> Lady_Aleena yes but thats the thing
[21:24] <White_Cat> it can never cost $100 per seat to go to space any time soon
[21:24] <Lady_Aleena> Song builds the 0 gee gaming space station and people pay to go up there to play.
[21:24] <MissAlyx> its possible, White_Cat
[21:24] <KimiNewt> "It can never .. soon"
[21:25] <White_Cat> spending $1000 to go to space once itself would be too expensive for some.
[21:25] <Lady_Aleena> Song/Sony
[21:25] <KimiNewt> Not in the next 20-30 years
[21:25] <MissAlyx> phones were expensive once.. so were computers
[21:25] <White_Cat> Lady_Aleena space is a very hostile environment
[21:25] <KimiNewt> 200,000$ for a 6-minute suborbital flight
[21:25] <White_Cat> safety is ridiclously difficult
[21:25] <Lady_Aleena> White_Cat, that is a given.
[21:25] <KimiNewt> Is what we'll have a few years from now
[21:25] <MissAlyx> lol, i'd have actually said it IS within 20-30 years
[21:25] <White_Cat> the reason why astronauts dont die is their training
[21:25] <mikehotel86> Has anybody read richard branson's Losing My Virginity?
[21:25] <KimiNewt> 100$ spaceflight?
[21:25] <White_Cat> they dont fuck around
[21:25] <KimiNewt> No.
[21:25] <MissAlyx> KimiNewt: absolutely
[21:25] <KimiNewt> Fuel costs more than that, easily
[21:26] <MissAlyx> the cost is in the fuel and the vehicle
[21:26] <MissAlyx> exactly, its just the fuel your looking at paying for
[21:26] <KimiNewt> you're
[21:26] <White_Cat> the vihecle is trashed in a typical space flight
[21:26] <White_Cat> also people dont realise just how hard it is to dock with anything in space
[21:26] <White_Cat> it requires a serious preparation
[21:26] <KimiNewt> White_Cat: Galactic's suborbital spaceplanes won't be
[21:26] <KimiNewt> We're talking suborbital white_cat
[21:26] <KimiNewt> I'm assuming
[21:26] <MissAlyx> White_Cat: it could be automated in this day and age
[21:26] <White_Cat> probably
[21:26] <White_Cat> but those orbits degrade fast
[21:26] <MissAlyx> very easily.
[21:27] <KimiNewt> are we talking about suborbital, MissAlyx?
[21:27] <White_Cat> MissAlyx there is space debris
[21:27] <MissAlyx> the roomba can put itself on charge, so im sure a multi million dollar shuttle can dock
[21:27] <MissAlyx> no KimiNewt
[21:27] <KimiNewt> then I dissagree
[21:27] <MissAlyx> im talking actually-out-there-in-the-nothingness
[21:27] <White_Cat> I hope you arent going to lauch a craft on a collision course with that derilict soyuz
[21:27] <White_Cat> MissAlyx any nasa delay can easily be for a full month
[21:27] <KimiNewt> we might, possibly see an oribtal commercial flight in like 2017
[21:27] <KimiNewt> and that's still going to be way way much more than 100$
[21:28] <White_Cat> thats to prepare the hardware (the craft) and software (the trejectory)
[21:28] <KimiNewt> the price won't go down a hundred thousand fold in ten years!
[21:28] <MissAlyx> because with nasa, everything is big, and made to be.. perfect, theyre doing "new stuff" every time
[21:28] <White_Cat> intercontinental flight is +$1000
[21:28] <White_Cat> orbit is further away
[21:28] <MissAlyx> with consumer space flight the "vehicles" would be uniform
[21:28] * Majorly has joined #wikipedia-en
[21:28] <Lady_Aleena> Putting the space programs of the world into the private sector would make space travel useful. While I am for some pure science, I would like to see space travel be profitable.
[21:29] <KimiNewt> I would also like it to be proftiable
[21:29] <KimiNewt> but it's impossible at the current time
[21:29] <White_Cat> MissAlyx if we had space elevators you'd be right
[21:29] <MissAlyx> the same model of vehicle every time, except when a new one comes in
[21:29] <KimiNewt> which is why we need the goverment
[21:29] <MissAlyx> just like planes
[21:29] <White_Cat> the research is mad expensive
[21:29] <KimiNewt> MissAlyx.. that's nice and all
[21:29] <KimiNewt> But the things that will go up in 2020
[21:29] <White_Cat> so that'd be in the price
[21:29] <White_Cat> the hardware is mad expensive
[21:29] <White_Cat> it would be in the price
[21:29] <KimiNewt> Are planned now
[21:29] <KimiNewt> And they will not have such a low price tag
[21:29] <KimiNewt> You're talking up in the air
[21:29] <White_Cat> dont think of money as currency
[21:29] <MissAlyx> its mad expensive because its not uniform
[21:29] * Emw has joined #wikipedia-en
[21:29] <MissAlyx> like i said, its new, by hand, every time
[21:29] <White_Cat> money is actualy the translation of work into a number
[21:30] <MissAlyx> if it was like building a plane it'd be much cheaper
[21:30] <KimiNewt> Can you point me to a company that will do 100$ tourism flight to orbital space?
[21:30] * Schroeder_ has joined #wikipedia-en
[21:30] <White_Cat> to build the hardware you'd have to sacrifice significant amount of resources and workforce whom otherwise could be stimuliting the economy
[21:30] <Emw> could an admin please block http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Adieu_Achenkirch?
[21:30] <KimiNewt> Virgin might do suborbital flights for 20-40,000$ in the 20s
[21:30] <MissAlyx> KimiNewt: the vehicles havnt been made yet
[21:30] <Lady_Aleena> KimiNewt, but the government shouldn't spend money on anything that doesn't directly help the health and safety of its population. Space travel doesn't do anything for me directly.
[21:30] <KimiNewt> Bigelow's stuff won't be up until the 20s
[21:30] <MissAlyx> once virgin has suborbital they'll want to go that one small step further
[21:30] <KimiNewt> and then it'll be used for science stuff for a while and be expensive
[21:31] <KimiNewt> It's the same with global warming Lady_Aleena..
[21:31] <White_Cat> KimiNewt in MissAlyx's defense it could be done. But that would mean companies would pull money off of their ass for the research and manifacture of the hardware
[21:31] <KimiNewt> or climate/ecostuff
[21:31] <PeterSymonds> Already done, Emw.
[21:31] <KimiNewt> Sure
[21:31] <KimiNewt> But look
[21:31] <PeterSymonds> Thanks though.
[21:31] <KimiNewt> Things are planned 10-20 years in advance
[21:32] <White_Cat> a key problem with space exploration is the 9/11 factor
[21:32] <KimiNewt> if there was a hint of something like an orbital tourism vehicle for as cheap as 100$ coming up we will at least be seeing sparkles of its early predecessor
[21:32] <White_Cat> significant change in funding of research
[21:32] <KimiNewt> Outside of Virgin no one has even done a real flight
[21:32] <KimiNewt> and that's SUBorbital
[21:32] <White_Cat> and people freak out over anything metalic flying now
[21:32] <KimiNewt> and they're not going to do a tourism flight for a while now
[21:32] <mikehotel86> Why 9 11.?
[21:32] <KimiNewt> and that's still suborbital
[21:32] <MissAlyx> the vehicle would be made to carry many people
[21:32] <MissAlyx> and not just 5 or so people
[21:32] * Lara|Sleep is now known as Lara
[21:32] <KimiNewt> No company will do a tourism on an orbital level in at LEAST the next 7-8 years
[21:33] <KimiNewt> And that's if there's a massive economic recovery somehow
[21:33] <MissAlyx> we'll see :)
[21:33] <KimiNewt> Alyx.. 
[21:33] <MissAlyx> im gonna go grab VICTORY FOOD
[21:33] <KimiNewt> Whatever
[21:33] <White_Cat> the companies that may fund research of space aircraft are boeing and airbus
[21:33] <KimiNewt> You don't seem to be following the space-related news recently
[21:33] <Lady_Aleena> Do you know how disappointed I am that the reality of 2010 does not match up to the fiction of 2010?
[21:33] <White_Cat> they'd have vested interest
[21:33] <White_Cat> but they are not doing too teribly well thanks to 9/11
[21:34] <KimiNewt> Alyx's "prediction" are ridiculous
[21:34] <KimiNewt> Intercontinental suborbital flight may occur 20-30 years from now

[21:34] <KimiNewt> so dunno if that'll work well
[21:34] <Lady_Aleena> 2001 was a really be let down, 2010 is just as much of one, and at this rate 2061 will be just as bad (if I live that long).
[21:34] <KimiNewt> but it doubles as tourism so perhaps
[21:34] <KimiNewt> You'll die

[21:34] <KimiNewt> I'm predicting it right now.
[21:35] <White_Cat> I dont know
[21:35] <KimiNewt> White_Cat - the current private sector has loads of encouragement
[21:35] <White_Cat> science can advance realy fast with a breakthrough

[21:41] <Lady_Aleena> White_Cat, I do when it comes off too fast. I lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks. I still don't know how I did it, and my sister says I am still losing weght.
[21:41] <KimiNewt> I haven't checked my weight in a while

[21:45] <White_Cat> yes it is
[21:45] <White_Cat> and experimental too
[21:45] <White_Cat> but they did so using stem cells
[21:45] <White_Cat> they grew teeth in a mouses mouth after ripping all of its teeth
[21:45] <White_Cat> meaning they can replace any lost teeth
[21:45] <White_Cat> and thats step #1
[21:45] <White_Cat> they can replace organs just as easily
[21:45] <mikehotel86> Haha
[21:45] <White_Cat> in 30 years this will be common

[22:02] <Ottava> it is irritating
[22:02] <White_Cat> that guy should have been dipped in bronze and handed out to other officials
[22:02] <Ottava> and makes some awful noise
[22:03] <BasketOfPuppies> Ottava, my back isn't as sore. been icing it a lot. off the opiates.
[22:03] <White_Cat> he did a heckuva job
[22:03] <White_Cat> right?
[22:03] <White_Cat> wrong
[22:03] <White_Cat> he was a terrible choice for the job
[22:03] <Lady_Aleena> White_Cat, it is better than what is happening with it now. It is the duty of the government to protect my life, so if to do so means that the healthcare system needs to be owned completely by the government so be it.
[22:03] <Ottava> Anyway
[22:03] <Ottava> Im going to go play some games
[22:03] <White_Cat> Lady_Aleena government should heavily regulate it

[22:53] <mikehotel86> Even after the ban?
[22:54] <BasketOfPuppies> how would ChanServ feel?

[23:14] <mikehotel86> It's annoying too. ;)
[23:14] <BasketOfPuppies> [Soap], i didn't think so
[23:14] <[Soap]> we have admins who vanished and returned and got admin rights transferred over to the new account without a new RfA
[23:14] <MW|CS> mikehotel86: I'm talking about something useful.
[23:15] <[Soap]> and we have people saying that those people should not exist
[23:15] <MW|CS> ChanServ is just a IRC service.
[23:15] <MW|CS> This is real life.
[23:15] <[Soap]> and we have people in between
[23:15] <BasketOfPuppies> [Soap], some may argue that they never resigned their adminship and they never abused it, so they still "own" it
[23:15] <mikehotel86> 'usefulness' is a subjective term.
[23:16] <Ottava> Right to Vanish means that the user stays gone
[23:16] <Ottava> once you clean start, your RtV should be revoked
[23:16] <BasketOfPuppies> Ottava, under all wikis?
[23:16] <Ottava> and all previous pages undeleted
[23:16] <Ottava> yes
[23:16] <MW|CS> BasketOfPuppies, could you help me on my wiki a bit
[23:16] <Ottava> It means you are removing all trace you existed
[23:16] <MW|CS> I have a work for you ;)
[23:16] <Ottava> and getting out completely
[23:16] <BasketOfPuppies> Ottava, if someone RtVs from the en.wp and goes to the Farsi Wiki, are they allowed to?
[23:16] <Ottava> They arent
[23:16] <MW|CS> http://misterwikki.wikia.com/wiki/Thomas_Anders_v._Dieter_Bohlen
[23:16] <Ottava> Because it violated what RtV was put up for
[23:16] <Ottava> it means people who are leaving completely
[23:16] <BasketOfPuppies> Ottava, are they ever allowed to edit any wikipedia ever again?
[23:17] <Ottava> It doesnt mean those who are hiding
[23:17] <Ottava> If you edit wikipedia then you arent abiding by the contract
[23:17] <Ottava> Your pages should be restored
[23:17] <[Soap]> I agree with Ottava, with the exception that real life concerns should trump Wikipedia policies.  If someone's getting death threats or in danger of losing their job, they should be allowed to vanish and come back even if others arent
[23:17] <MrZ-man> the problem is that there isn't a huge difference between a clean start and using a sockpuppet to avoid scrutiny, the only real difference is that the usage of the accounts doesn't overlap
[23:17] <tombom_> im gay
[23:17] <BasketOfPuppies> [Soap], does that apply to privacy violations as well?
[23:17] <Ottava> Soap - if someone has real life concerns, to be honest, they should be banned
[23:17] <BasketOfPuppies> Ottava, why is that?
[23:17] <MW|CS> tombom_ you said that you weren't gay, some days ago
[23:17] <[Soap]> then you would have to ban a lot of admins
[23:17] <Ottava> Because Wikipedia is not a place for that
[23:18] <Ottava> If you cant handle problems
[23:18] <Ottava> then you should be cut off
[23:18] <tombom_> no i didn't
[23:18] <tombom_> when did i say that
[23:18] <MissAlyx> you'd need to ban so many people you might aswel close down wikipedia.
[23:18] <BasketOfPuppies> Ottava, i don't understand how that can lead to banning. if someone randomly comes along and threatens an admin with murder i don't see why the admin should be banned
[23:18] <Herodotus> Ottava: Like you were?
[23:18] <Ottava> If someone keeps getting mauled by a bear, they should be banned from the Zoo

[23:18] <mikehotel86> :D
[23:18] <BasketOfPuppies> Ottava, is it their fault that the zoo keeps the cage door open?
[23:18] <Ottava> BoP - if the admin says they cant handle it and need a new name, then they shouldnt be there
[23:18] <BasketOfPuppies> Ottava, that is classic blaming the victim
[23:18] <Ottava> either file charges
[23:18] <Ottava> and deal with it
[23:18] <Ottava> or dont
[23:18] <Ottava> Anything else doesnt belong
[23:18] <BasketOfPuppies> Ottava, er, i do not agree with your assessment.
[23:19] <Ottava> I dont agree with sock puppets
[23:19] <BasketOfPuppies> Ottava, in fact, i would go as far as to say i Strongly Disagree with it
[23:19] <Ottava> or liars
[23:19] <Ottava> or people who deceive who they are
[23:19] <Ottava> I am honest about who I am
[23:19] <Ottava> because I can't stand lies of any form
[23:19] <MissAlyx> Ottava: yeah, a dick. :|
[23:19] <Ottava> Lies destroy everything
[23:19] <BasketOfPuppies> Ottava, 99% of wiki editors are deceiving who they are. they edit anonymously from a made up code name
[23:19] <Ottava> Lies are the basis of corruption
[23:19] <MissAlyx> theres a difference between lying, and not telling people your past
[23:19] <jessica_h> Ottava, punish the victim... ban the subject of the threats :?
[23:19] <Ottava> MissAlyx - creating a new name is lying
[23:19] <BasketOfPuppies> jessica_h, that is exactly what he is advocating, which is why i Strongly Disagree with it
[23:20] <Ottava> Jessica - if they need to find a new name, then they cant handle Wikipedia
[23:20] <Ottava> We shouldnt coddle people
[23:20] * CR90 has joined #wikipedia-en
[23:20] <Qcoder00> Why is ottava still allowed in here?
[23:20] <MissAlyx> if someone has had a bad experience on wikipedia, and done some stupid shit in the past, i think they should be allowed to start again (if theyve changed that is)
[23:20] <BasketOfPuppies> Ottava, i think this is why you are currently banned
[23:20] <Ottava> If someone threatens your life, do you think you will be allowed a clean start?
[23:20] <MissAlyx> Ottava: says the christian that cant take science..
[23:20] <BasketOfPuppies> MissAlyx, i entirely agree with you, and so does Wiki Policy
[23:20] <Ottava> Wikipedia isnt some separate fantasy world
[23:20] <mikehotel86> That's very inconsiderate ottava
[23:20] <Ottava> Can't take science?
[23:20] <Ottava> What kind of bs is that
[23:20] <Qcoder00> Any chanops?
[23:20] <Ottava> I have more graduate credits in math and science than you have
[23:20] <Ottava> I've had doctoral level classes on Darwin
[23:20] <MissAlyx> err.. of course you cant.
[23:20] <jessica_h> so you take the one strike rule to strict enforcement :S
[23:20] <MW|CS> what happens Qcoder00.
[23:21] <MissAlyx> or else you would be atheist.
[23:21] <[Soap]> just use the ! word, QCoder
[23:21] <MissAlyx> and wikipedia IS a 'seperate fantasy world'.. its the internet.
[23:21] <tombom_> uh what did ottava just say that involved science
[23:21] <MissAlyx> its not real life.
[23:21] <Ottava> Um, most scientists were not atheists
[23:21] <MissAlyx> wikipedia can go at any time, right now for that matter
[23:21] <Ottava> We already had that conversation
[23:21] <MissAlyx> Ottava: well they are now.
[23:21] <Ottava> and you were already pwned
[23:21] <tombom_> haha what
[23:21] <jessica_h> and yet O you seem to not like it applied to you :S
[23:21] <Qcoder00> [Soap] : This isn't  worthy of using that yet
[23:21] <MissAlyx> at the begining of evolutiionary theory you wasnt ALLOWED to be atheist..
[23:21] <Ottava> They are? According to who?
[23:21] <Ottava> You?
[23:21] <[Soap]> Basket: I strongly get the impression that since Ottava is banned from Wikipedia, he is saying things that he normally wouldnt.  Whether he believes in them or not, is hard to tell
[23:21] <tombom_> of course a scientist doesn't have to be atheist
[23:21] <tombom_> what a stupid thing to say
[23:21] <MissAlyx> according to a major US scientist group
[23:21] * Not_the_NSA has joined #wikipedia-en
[23:21] <Ottava> There were many atheists during the 19th century
[23:21] <MissAlyx> most are atheist.
[23:21] <BasketOfPuppies> [Soap], likely true
[23:21] <tombom_> what
[23:21] <Ottava> US scientists?
[23:22] <Ottava> US scientists represent maybe 3% of scientists
[23:22] <tombom_> i imagine most are atheists
[23:22] <MW|CS> {}: You are French, really?
[23:22] <Ottava> What about India?
[23:22] <Ottava> China?
[23:22] <Ottava> Japan?
[23:22] <tombom_> but it's absurd what you said anyway
[23:22] <MissAlyx> a large group of scientists.
[23:22] <Ottava> And what is the definition of "scientist"
[23:22] <Ottava> ?
[23:22] <MissAlyx> in america, a very dumbed down religious country
[23:22] <MrZ-man> which US scientist group?
[23:22] <Ottava> Hell, Islam has a lot of scientists
[23:22] <MissAlyx> i dont remember the name, i saw a chart somewhere
[23:22] <tombom_> "very dumbed down"???
[23:22] * Valley2city has joined #wikipedia-en
[23:22] <tombom_> what does that even mean

[23:22] <MissAlyx> america has news hidden from it
[23:22] <MrZ-man> I doubt that there's really one group that represents anything close to a majority of all scientists in the US
[23:22] <Qcoder00> ##politics exists for a reason people!!
[23:22] <Herodotus> [Soap]: Ottava is one of those people who says what he's thinking even when it's illogical or a really good idea to keep your mouth shut. For better or worse, that's him.
[23:23] <mikehotel86> You people talk like freudian free assocition discourse.
[23:23] <Ottava> MrZ-man - yah
[23:23] <MuZemike> "Definition of a 'Scientist': A man to tries to understand everything until there is nothing left to understand."
[23:23] <BasketOfPuppies> Herodotus, you got it right
[23:23] <MissAlyx> american news is "we've saved one person from a fire".. the rest of the world is seeing "thousands have died"
[23:23] <MissAlyx> america cant handle bad news.
[23:23] <mikehotel86> Correct
[23:23] * Natalie has quit IRC (Excess Flood)
[23:23] <{}> MW|CS,oui.
[23:23] <BasketOfPuppies> anyhow, i think that CLEANSTART should not prohibit someone to ever run for admin
[23:24] <tombom_> EVERYBODY has news hidden from them
[23:24] <MW|CS> Hehe.
[23:24] <MrZ-man> I don't read news based on scientific studies because its almost always oversimplifed to the point of uselessness, if not changing the meaning altogether
[23:24] <BasketOfPuppies> in fact, i think it explicitly allows it
[23:24] <Ottava> Cleanstart was a failed idea
[23:24] <tombom_> the mass media always does stuff like that
[23:24] <Ottava> and only causes problems
[23:24] <MissAlyx> british news is better because we just hear all the bad
[23:24] <tombom_> and MrZ-man  is correct
[23:24] <BasketOfPuppies> MrZ-man, that is so true. this is why we have pubmed abstracts
[23:24] <MissAlyx> we hear about everyone dying, we dont hear about successes
[23:24] <tombom_> i think the bbc is often better but it's not because of some mystical british thing
[23:24] <Ottava> BBC is better about what?
[23:24] <MissAlyx> its because we dont have generations of news been hidden from us
[23:24] <MW|CS> Yo soy Chileno {}
[23:24] <MW|CS> .9
[23:25] <MrZ-man> the news will take one sentence out of a 10 page study and turn it into a headline
[23:25] <MissAlyx> if americans suddenly started getting the full story they'd think the world was coming to an end
[23:25] <jessica_h> i can't type fast enough to stay current in this conversation XD :'(
[23:25] <MissAlyx> because suddenly everything seems a lot worse than it was.
[23:25] <Ottava> Alyx reveals himself to be a conspiracy theorist o.o;;

[23:25] <MissAlyx> do american news companies even report about the afghan war?
[23:25] <tombom_> of course
[23:25] <Ottava> The hysteria is only among the minority with nothing better to do
[23:25] <MrZ-man> if americans got the full story, they'd realize how boring the world really is
[23:25] <Ottava> Anyway, Alyx claimed that life was meaningless

[23:25] * BarkingFish has joined #wikipedia-en

[23:26] <MissAlyx> life is meaningless you turd.
[23:26] <Ottava> If it is meaningless, why is he so invested?
[23:26] <tombom_> when did she say that
[23:26] <tombom_> oh right there
[23:26] <tombom_> i guess
[23:26] <MissAlyx> because i want to make sure everybody else knows it is
[23:26] <Ottava> Tombomb - he
[23:26] <Ottava> Alyx is a guy
[23:26] <MissAlyx> she.
[23:26] <BasketOfPuppies> has anyone seen gurch lately?
[23:26] <tombom_> Ottava: why
[23:26] <MissAlyx> alyx is missalyx.
[23:26] <Ottava> Alyx is a man using a female name like Natalie : P
[23:26] <tombom_> oh ok

[23:26] <BarkingFish> thx
[23:27] <Ottava> You admitted to being a gay male : P
[23:27] <MissAlyx> Ottava: I would never tell you anything personal about myself.

[23:28] <Natalie> Not really here.
[23:28] <Ottava> Privacy doesn't exist on the internet
[23:28] <BasketOfPuppies> Ottava, people should respect privacy
[23:28] <Ottava> If you want privacy
[23:28] <Ottava> you cant go out into public
[23:28] <Ottava> Its that simple
[23:28] <Ottava> public = not private
[23:28] <BarkingFish> You mean Ayn Rand, the eminent 20th century Astronomer? Or whatever the hell he was?
[23:28] <Ottava> Become a recluse
[23:28] <Ottava> disconnect yourself
[23:29] <Ottava> Astronomer : )
[23:29] <MissAlyx> the internet isnt real life, privacy CAN exist on the internet.
[23:29] <Ottava> Yes
[23:29] <Ottava> She was an eminent Astronomer : )
[23:29] <MuZemike> Just like there is no such thing as privacy in a locker room?
[23:29] <tombom_> it would have been better for the world if ayn rand was an astronomer
[23:29] <Ottava> The internet isn't real life?
[23:29] <Ottava> Oh god
[23:29] <Qcoder00> Otava: You are Daniel Brandt and I claim my Five wikis edits :)
[23:29] <MissAlyx> if i use tor for all my connections, you'd never know my real host.. you'd just know what i tell you
[23:29] <Ottava> >.<
[23:29] <Qcoder00> XD
[23:29] <Ottava> It is all real life
[23:29] <Ottava> There is no other life
[23:29] <BasketOfPuppies> Ottava, the wikimedia foundation goes to great lengths to ensure privacy for editors
[23:29] <tombom_> no
[23:29] <tombom_> it doesn't
[23:29] <tombom_> at all
[23:29] <Ottava> If I was Daniel Brandt I would put up more pictures of fat people
[23:29] <Qcoder00> Why is Ottava still even allowed in here?
[23:29] <tombom_> the wmf is worthless
[23:29] <MissAlyx> Qcoder00: i dont know
[23:29] <MissAlyx> nobody likes him
[23:29] <tombom_> why shouldn't he be

[23:29] <MissAlyx> hes more hated than me for fucks sake O.o

[23:30] <Ottava> But people were asking for you to be banned yesterday o.o;;
[23:30] <Ottava> Outing?
[23:30] <MissAlyx> i'm not seeing much love.
[23:30] <Ottava> If you post on a previous account
[23:30] <tombom_> it depends on who is doing it
[23:30] <tombom_> i love ottava
[23:30] <Qcoder00> Ottava: Asking for me to banned , where?
[23:30] <tombom_> there i said it
[23:30] <Ottava> its not outing to point it out
[23:30] <Ottava> Qcoder00 - you even whined in response to it
[23:30] <MissAlyx> people will always dislike someone like Qcoder00, someone that tries to take charge out of the masses.. but people definately dislike you :|

[23:37] <MissAlyx> same way i can judge people by the books they write

[23:38] <Ottava> burn!
[23:38] <Qcoder00> :)
[23:38] <mikehotel86> That's loony toon thinking
[23:38] <MissAlyx> Ottava: burn, like you used to do to witches.
[23:38] <Jeff_G> Hi. Does anyone else see a possible COI  in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Samwb123 bending over backward to positively spin articles http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyWay_Searchbar , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask.com , and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAC_(company) ?
[23:38] <MissAlyx> witches that dont exist.
[23:38] <tombom_> somebody might have to write pulp to make a living but be very intelligent
[23:38] <Ironholds> Qcoder: no problem
[23:38] <Ottava> Witches were merely political dissidents and more males were burned at the stake than females
[23:38] <tombom_> MissAlyx: is that a comment about ottava's age?
[23:39] <MissAlyx> tombom_: i judge them by the contents of what they do :P
[23:39] <Ottava> Furthermore, the British burned quite a few Witches, so you can attack the good ol Church of England
[23:39] <MissAlyx> tombom_: not at all, Ottava knows what its about
[23:39] <Ottava> Or you can mock the Puritans
[23:39] <tombom_> of course i know, i was making a joke
[23:39] <MissAlyx> see, he got it!
[23:39] <MissAlyx> Ottava: im more than willing to attack the church
[23:39] <Qcoder00> Ironholds: IIRC some of the stuff I am thinking about was important in the debate about 'traiff' reforms IIRC
[23:39] <Ottava> No, you are more willing to spew ignorance
[23:39] <Ottava> and claim it as an attack
[23:39] <MissAlyx> i'd burn it to the groud and poop in the ashes if i had the chance
[23:39] <Ottava> mostly because you couldnt actually determine enough to make an accurate claim
[23:39] <MissAlyx> +n
[23:39] <Ottava> And yet nothing matters
[23:40] <Ottava> I love how angry you get over something that doesnt matter
[23:40] <Qcoder00> Actually , witches were rarely burnt in the UK
[23:40] <Ottava> You are so contradictory
[23:40] <Qcoder00> Witches were hangegd.

[23:40] <MissAlyx> and one of the stupidest things ever
[23:41] <MissAlyx> what moron thought of that
[23:41] <Herodotus> Qcoder00: But I just watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It directly contradicts what you said!
[23:41] <MissAlyx> i mean, COME ON
[23:41] <MW|CS> Anyone can help me copyediting an article on my wiki?

[23:42] <Herodotus> MissAlyx: That movie is a classic.
[23:42] <Ottava> MW, Im banned
[23:42] <Ottava> and so are you
[23:42] <Ottava> Its hard to help each other
[23:42] <MW|CS> In /my/ wiki
[23:42] <MissAlyx> only a great christian church could think of something as logically incorrect as that.
[23:42] <Ottava> Oh, well
[23:42] * tombom__ has joined #wikipedia-en
[23:42] <Ottava> I have drinking to do
[23:42] <Herodotus> MissAlyx: And actually, the stuff about "science" at that point in history isn't too far off the mark.
[23:42] <Ottava> MissAlyx, secular governments were the ones to execute heretics and witches
[23:42] <MissAlyx> Herodotus: which stuff?
[23:42] <Ottava> not the Catholic Church
[23:43] <BarkingFish> mikehotel86: we have a slightly different feel to ourselves off wiki... We sorta let our hair down and our tempers loose :)
[23:43] <MissAlyx> there was no such thing as a secular government.
[23:43] <MuZemike> That did that regularly in Soviet Russia...
[23:43] <Herodotus> MissAlyx: The logic about how to tell if she's a witch.
[23:43] <MissAlyx> the goverment is still run by religion..
[23:43] <Ottava> No such thing as a secular government?
[23:43] <BarkingFish> and mw, what's this about you being banned again?
[23:43] <Ottava> ahahahaha
[23:43] <MW|CS> Ottava: http://misterwikki.wikia.com/wiki/En:Thomas_Anders_v._Dieter_Bohlen
[23:43] <Ottava> Someone tell that to France, Germany, UK, etc
[23:43] <MissAlyx> Herodotus: ok, and in what way isn't it "far off the mark"?
[23:43] <MW|CS> * sorry for the off-topic chat *
[23:43] <MissAlyx> i live in the UK.
[23:43] <MissAlyx> and ive just said it.
[23:43] <Ottava> Hell, the Vatican was invaded at least 7 different times and the pope replaced by secular governments
[23:44] <Ottava> You really need to relearn history
[23:44] <MissAlyx> euthanasia laws for example, are still there.. because of religion
[23:44] * MW|CS is now known as MW|away
[23:44] <Herodotus> MissAlyx: Let's put it this way. Is there any scientifically sound way to prove someone's a witch?
[23:44] <MissAlyx> if religion had no influence over government that law would be LONG gone.. many years ago..
[23:44] * Res2216firestar has joined #wikipedia-en
[23:44] <MissAlyx> Herodotus: they dont even exist, so no.
[23:44] <MissAlyx> its a way to tell if people can swim or not..
[23:44] <Ottava> MissAlyx - Religion having an influence over a government does not mean the religion controls a government
[23:44] <Ottava> Gravity has an influence over aspects of government
[23:44] <MissAlyx> yes it does Ottava.
[23:45] <Ottava> Does that mean all laws are based on gravity?
[23:45] * killiondude has joined #wikipedia-en
[23:45] <Ottava> Okay, when you go to relearn history
[23:45] <MissAlyx> in the runup to the elections all the parties shout LOOK AT US WE'RE SO RELIGIOUS VOTE FOR US
[23:45] <Ottava> relearn logic too
[23:45] <MissAlyx> in america, ireland, britain..
[23:45] <Ottava> Being religious has nothing to do with having religion control something
[23:45] <mikehotel86> Why do i bump into this debate, anywhere i go?
[23:45] <MissAlyx> logic isnt something you learn.. its either something you have, or dont
[23:45] * Ironholds has joined #wikipedia-en
[23:45] <MissAlyx> See also: http://imgkk.com/i/Yl0qsR.png
[23:46] <Ottava> MissAlyx, logic is a school of thought
[23:46] <Ottava> it is taught
[23:46] <Ottava> just like rhetoric
[23:46] <Ottava> it has rules and processes
[23:46] <Ottava> It is something you learn
[23:46] <mikehotel86> Incorrect. Logic is a learnable art.
[23:46] <Ottava> >.<

[23:46] <MissAlyx> proof religious people arent as intelligent: they don't get it that you can't disprove a universal negative..
[23:46] <mikehotel86> Wrong
[23:47] <Ottava> MissAlyx, you keep saying nothing matters so why do you keep going on and on?
[23:47] <BarkingFish> i'd like to say one thing. I was told this a week or three ago.  If you have drama, instead of cluttering the channel and annoying everyone else, take it to pm. For fuck's sake, it's nice to get a word in sideways :)
[23:47] <MissAlyx> theyre happy in their world of "hahaha you cant disprove it".. err.... no shit sherlock? because in the real world it's the responsiblity of the claimer to prove its right..
[23:47] <Ottava> Is it because you feel life is worthless so you have to waste everyone's time?
[23:47] <Qcoder00> Mikehotel86:  have you read the C.S Lewis , Tolkien exchange on Christian thought?
[23:47] <BarkingFish> When we can?
[23:47] <MuZemike> They're not intelligent? I'm intelligent. I have an IQ of 192. ;)
[23:47] <Ottava> haha BarkingFish
[23:47] <Ottava> MuZemike - I doubt that
[23:47] <Ottava> Maybe 19.2
[23:47] <MissAlyx> if i say the universe is controlled by shape shifting dildos, its up to me to prove it.. not everyone else.
[23:47] <Ottava> : )
[23:47] <MuZemike> Hah
[23:47] <MissAlyx> because you cant disprove it.
[23:48] <MuZemike> Or at least Wiki Greek Basketball
[23:48] <MissAlyx> which means my theory about shape shifting dildos is just as reputable as christianity, well done me.
[23:48] <BasketOfPuppies> MissAlyx, it's controlled by shape shifting vaginas!! it ridiculous to think it's controlled by dildos!!

[23:48] <Qcoder00> Bop: Erm...
[23:48] <MissAlyx> the universe is actually made up of a ball pit in a higher dimension.
[23:48] <MissAlyx> and every time theres a natural disaster a kid has just jumped in.
[23:48] <BasketOfPuppies> Qcoder00, just adding to the silliness of it all
[23:48] <killiondude> /clear
[23:49] <Qcoder00> Depends if you support  a matrichal or patriachal unvierse
[23:49] <BasketOfPuppies>  /clear
[23:49] <Ottava> Good idea, killiondude
[23:49] <MissAlyx> what fascinates me about the universe is.. whats.. at the end o.o
[23:49] <Ottava> Anyway, Aristotle already proved the necessity for a prime movier
[23:49] <MissAlyx> there HAS to be an end, surely

[23:49] <Ottava> which is still accepted in Quantum physics -and- Darwinian evolutionary theory
[23:49] <MissAlyx> and if it "loops back" somehow.. whats beyond the bit you cant get to O.o

[23:51] <MissAlyx> the only thing that seperates dildoism from christianity is more people claim theyre christian.

[23:51] <Zed`> Qcoder00: some scientists think that thare are just more universes with their own big bang.

[23:51] <Zed`> sometimes they do
[23:51] * litherp2 has joined #wikipedia-en
[23:52] <Zed`> like galaxies do soemtimes
[23:52] <Zed`> but normally the distance between each universe is HUGE to say the lest
[23:52] <Zed`> least*
[23:52] <MissAlyx> i like the idea of parallel universes, that somewhere there is a universe where i own wikipedia and ive banned everyone i dont like :P
[23:52] * Zed`  laughs
[23:52] <MissAlyx> and somewhere i own microsoft
[23:53] <MissAlyx> and in one of them ive made a device that lets me jump between the universes..
[23:53] <MissAlyx> collect my winnings in the microsoft universe, then the google one, and then bring it all back to this one
[23:53] <Ottava> Make a device to help you jump off a cliff
[23:53] <Ottava> >.<
[23:53] <Qcoder00> In one parallel universe , I have a Wikipedia run by the Open University :)
[23:53] <MissAlyx> only a christian would think you need a device for that :P
[23:53] * Guest61430 /me
[23:53] <Zed`> I dunno about the idea of mirror like universes but the idea of many universes is a simple one that could explain the what we have managed to observe of our universe
[23:53] <MissAlyx> all you do is jump.
[23:54] <Qcoder00> MissAlyx: Or inmy case slide with style :0
[23:54] <Qcoder00> :)

[23:54] <BarkingFish> missalyx: no, it'd be more likely a universe where everyone can join except you, and we can get some peace :D
[23:54] <MissAlyx> whats the name of that experiment where the things go through both slots when it should only have gone through one O.o?
[23:54] <MW|away> BarkingFish: And except Bush and Hitler.
[23:55] <MissAlyx> pff, hitler>bush
[23:55] <MissAlyx> atleast hitler tried to achieve something
[23:55] <MissAlyx> bush just started a war and played tanks in his back garden
[23:55] <MW|away> no, hitler=bush
[23:55] <Qcoder00> Hitler isn't histories worst mass killer though
[23:55] <litherp2> godwin
[23:55] <MissAlyx> i know Qcoder00
[23:55] * Ironholds has left #wikipedia-en
[23:55] <MissAlyx> it'd be ridiculous to think that :P

[23:58] <MissAlyx> do you think the nazis intentionaly made their uniforms to be EXTREMELY stylish, or do you think it was an accidental result of the image they were going for?
