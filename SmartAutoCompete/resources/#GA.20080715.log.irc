[00:05] <BlueTsunami> Scarlet: Netflix, XMB, Avatars and FFXIII for the 360

[00:06] <MaddenNFL64> Oh, thats the funnest chapter. EPIC STAIRS
[00:06] <stump> Armitage: basically between price and performance they picked what they thought was the best spot, and now they're going for more performance
[00:06] <atomsk> finally got around to watching that new RE5 trailer. so awesome
[00:06] <stump> Which sort of pre-emptively rebuts any potential PS360 waggle
[00:06] <Armitage> but now it'll be an add on :(
[00:06] <MaddenNFL64> Go upgraded flail on that part.
[00:06] <milh31> "Does Anderson have any idea how fucking cool it would be to bring in some of these experts to choreograph all of the stunts and fight scenes with a similar chain whip? Obviously not because he chose to arm Castlevania’s hero with a fucking sword. Idiot."
[00:06] * Andvary has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[00:07] * Milabrega has left #GA
[00:07] <stump> Armitage: but it'll almost certainly be an addon that's packaged with a game and sold separately for 19.99, so what's the big deal?

[00:18] <ddkawaii> THEN
[00:18] <ddkawaii> after the room was buzzing with uncomfortable buzz

[00:22] <Kabouter> Yeah
[00:22] <EviLore> not really, no, advertisement situation on gaf is pretty shitty at the moment
[00:22] <Kabouter> Because the democratic party acts as one bloc
[00:22] <ddkawaii> sorry madden
[00:22] <Kabouter> Get a sales manager EviLore

[00:22] <ddkawaii> i finally talked to a sales group
[00:22] <EviLore> mm
[00:22] <ddkawaii> well a few of them
[00:22] <Sea_Manky> Evilore: That's not advertising we can believe in!
[00:23] <Danj> did this get posted on here? http://trailers.gametrailers.com/gt_vault/2649/t_ff13_e32k8_jpv2.flv
[00:23] <Danj> seems like a direct feed ff13 trailer
[00:23] <ddkawaii> a site like gaf (according to them, ) should make no less than about $5K-$6K /months
[00:23] <ddkawaii> BUT
[00:23] <ddkawaii> they told me that gaf's ads arent intrusive enough
[00:23] <ddkawaii> and although my site isn't a forum
[00:23] <ddkawaii> they said i need to use one of their templates
[00:23] <ddkawaii> which are intrusive as FUCK
[00:23] <ddkawaii> :=(
[00:23] <ddkawaii> japanese sales/marketing groups ftl
[00:24] <Kabouter> It's not even intrusiveness.
[00:24] <ddkawaii> for me it doesnt matter
[00:24] <Kabouter> GAF could make a lot more with targeted ads
[00:24] <ddkawaii> but for gaf
[00:24] <ddkawaii> it could be ugly
[00:24] <MaddenNFL64> So how much do you guys pay per month to keep the forum going?
[00:24] <EviLore> yah kab
[00:24] <MaddenNFL64> Or is that a state secret
[00:24] <ddkawaii> gaf targeted ads?
[00:24] <MrPing1000> is there anywhere I can watch the microsoft conference?

[00:25] <iapetus> Question: what tool should be used to remove the screws holding the PS3's hard drive in place?
[00:25] <iapetus> a) A precision screwdriver.
[00:25] <iapetus> b) An electric screwdriver.
[00:25] <iapetus> c) A wrench.
[00:25] <iapetus> d) A hacksaw.
[00:25] <iapetus> e) All of the above.
[00:25] <ddkawaii> :-P
[00:25] <Kabouter> f
[00:25] <ddkawaii> ?
[00:25] <Kabouter> A chainsaw
[00:25] * stump has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[00:25] <ddkawaii> i dont see  Mace
[00:25] <ddkawaii> i'd use one of those
[00:25] <Kabouter> Chainsaw is more precise
[00:25] <iapetus> I'm all out of chainsaws, so I went with e and a lot of swearing.
[00:25] <Kabouter> How about some liquid nitrogen?
[00:25] * Andvary has joined #GA
[00:25] <MaddenNFL64> blow torch.
[00:25] <ddkawaii> iap - i hink a normal screwdriver will work
[00:25] * stump has joined #GA
[00:26] <iapetus> Screwdriver and wrench fixed the blue screw.
[00:26] <ddkawaii> the panel is just a flap
[00:26] <ddkawaii> and the drive has a clip
[00:26] <ddkawaii> i think there's 1 screw
[00:26] <mrsolo> iapetus: gamestop employee
[00:26] <mrsolo> I WIN!
[00:26] <Kabouter> Plasma cutter
[00:26] <iapetus> mrsolo: I didn't want to use excessive violence. :P
[00:26] <ddkawaii> how many gamespot employees does it take to say some stupid ass shit that pisses you off?
[00:26] <ddkawaii> any guesses?
[00:26] <iapetus> ddkawaii: one screw to get the enclosure out, which doesn't succumb to normal screwdriving.
[00:26] <MaddenNFL64> You wanna pre-order Saints Row 2? Only costs 5 bucks.
[00:27] <iapetus> Then four screws holding the drive in the enclosure, which don't even succumb to *special* screwdriving.
[00:27] <ddkawaii> u could always use gaime's toothpick like dick , whien its not up in his mom that is
[00:27] <ddkawaii> OHH SNAP
[00:27] <Kabouter> http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/178851/fd943cea/meisjes_met_wii.html
[00:27] <iapetus> And the answer to your question is apparently 'all of them'. I don't know why, it just always works out that way.
[00:27] <ddkawaii> nah, seriously did you remove that flap thingie?
[00:27] <Thomper> Dumpert!
[00:27] <MaddenNFL64> meisjes
[00:27] <ddkawaii> iap - it suold come right out
[00:27] <Tiduzlaptop> HOLY shit at ffxiii trailer
[00:27] <Tiduzlaptop> <3
[00:27] <iapetus> The blue screw wouldn't unscrew.
[00:27] <ddkawaii> with a like 4-5 full rotations
[00:28] <Tiduzlaptop> Well, if the battle system is XII they kan keep it.
[00:28] <ddkawaii> iea - do you need to do it now?
[00:28] <ddkawaii> iap - what model?
[00:28] <iapetus> Oh, I've done it.
[00:28] <MaddenNFL64> It's not. They said it's all flashy style now. Like backflips off of missles.
[00:28] <ddkawaii> waht was the proble?
[00:28] <iapetus> I wasn't kidding when I said the screwdriver and wrench worked to get the blue screw out.
[00:28] <iapetus> Nor when I said I used a hacksaw to get the drive out of the enclosure. :D
[00:29] <iapetus> Applying enough pressure to turn the screws just stripped the heads completely, even with perfectly matched screwdrivers.
[00:29] <iapetus> So I just had to cut my own heads into them that were large enough for a serious power screwdriver to get them out.
[00:29] <frod> freeze the screw first with a locally applied liquid nitrogen spray
[00:30] <iapetus> And this is supposed to be an upgrade anyone can do at home?
[00:30] <MaddenNFL64> Damn so many new trailers on XBL right now. Gotta DL them all!

[00:32] <Diablos> oh man
[00:33] <MaddenNFL64> Ninja Warrior is pretty cool.
[00:34] <Armitage> so today has been pretty megaton-y actually
[00:34] <Armitage> i'm surprised
[00:34] <charlequin> yeah, this is definitely not e3 07
[00:34] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> something else happen since the MS conference?
[00:34] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> I mean Superwaggle and FFXIII 360 are pretty big
[00:35] <Armitage> just those basically
[00:35] <charlequin> just those
[00:35] <MaddenNFL64> FF13 on 360, Wiimote Plus. Yep, pretty cool day.
[00:35] <charlequin> but we have two more conferences tomorrow
[00:35] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> i usually consider megatons to be almost exclusively new software
[00:35] <frod> and galaga looks more trippy even than superspaceinvadersextreme
[00:35] <iapetus> FF13 isn't big at all for anyone who's multiplatform.

[00:36] <iapetus> Console warz can go fuck themselves.
[00:36] <Armitage> gaime: what?
[00:36] <Oldschoolgamer> lol
[00:36] <Armitage> dude
[00:36] <charlequin> iapetus: their conference really did suck for new game announcements
[00:36] <Armitage> "OMG FF BEST SERIES EVER ONLY ON PS3"
[00:36] <MaddenNFL64> I'm a Wii60 guy atm, so i'm always begging & hoping awesome PS3 games fall onto the 360 somehow.
[00:36] <charlequin> iapetus: the biggest news for me was all the Rock Band awesomeness
[00:36] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> okay, which consoles sales are going to explode due to this?
[00:36] <Armitage> WARS, not SALES :|

[00:40] <Tiduzlaptop> Are there any USA PSN cards being sold?
[00:40] <iapetus> BECAUSE YOU HAVE A SHITTY PROPRIETARY HARD DRIVE THAT COSTS LIKE A BILLION POUNDS PER GIGABYTE, ASSHATS.
[00:40] <Tiduzlaptop> on sites like playasia
[00:40] <iapetus> Seriously, it's like a pound a gigabyte.
[00:40] <mrsolo> so what?
[00:40] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> two pounds
[00:40] <iapetus> Or, to put it in US terms, fifty gazillion dollars.
[00:41] <iapetus> So my hard drive is full, and without taking out a second mortgage I can't afford a larger one.
[00:41] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> iapetus:  and it's not even all available to use!
[00:41] <iapetus> And the upgrade process is crappy.
[00:41] <iapetus> Sony didn't get *too* many things righter than Microsoft this generation, but damn, that was one of them.
[00:41] <iapetus> If they can get better screws.

[00:43] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> so what 3rd party exclusives does the Ps3 have now

[00:43] <BJ> Oh, unreleased yet? :P
[00:43] <Azih> well MGS4 for another say... 8 months or so
[00:43] <EviLore> From IGN's Live Blog (others say the same thing)
[00:43] <EviLore> 1:01 - They are "ready to start" developing FF XIII. So first they will complete the PS3 version in Japan, then start a localization for the US and Europe while they start development on the 360 version.
[00:43] <EviLore> 1:03 - The PS3 and the 360 versions will be released simultaneously in the US and Europe, but not Japan.
[00:43] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> O_o
[00:43] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> makes sense
[00:43] * Mike_Works has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[00:43] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> 360 is dead in the water in Japan
[00:43] <MaddenNFL64> No japan, ya I saw the live blog on kotaku.
[00:43] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> and Ps3 is barely staying afloat
[00:44] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> better get it out before the Ps3 sinks too
[00:44] <Azih> the West is Square enix's only hope of making money off of traditional games
[00:44] <mrsolo> gaime: ps3 won't sink 
[00:44] <Lelielle> as long as my japanese friend has a 360  it's ok
[00:44] <mrsolo> gaime: unless someone comes up with better and cheaper blueray player
[00:44] <EGM92> solo don't directly talk to gaime, it's not wise talking to Nintard
[00:44] <EGM92> s
[00:44] <Azih> there's already cheaper bluray players yes?

[00:45] <MaddenNFL64> The 360 is a damn fine RPG machine thanks to that.
[00:45] <ddkawaii> u can import jp ff13
[00:45] <ddkawaii> then get it again in english
[00:45] <ddkawaii> so ps3 ff fans
[00:46] <ddkawaii> double dip
[00:46] <sp0rsk> sooo ffxiii is the only major announcement?
[00:46] <iapetus> EGM92: Seems like it depends on whether your screws were put in by highly trained screw-fitting Geisha girls or evil human-hating screw-fitting robots of doom.
[00:46] <ddkawaii> supporitng their platform of choice
[00:46] <mrsolo> ddk: HAHAHAHA
[00:46] <Azih> it's a damn fine RPG machine because of THE LAST REMNANT
[00:46] <iapetus> You got the Geisha girls, I got the robots.

[00:47] <ddkawaii> i heard the DualSuck 3 controler is amazing
[00:47] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> you know
[00:47] <ddkawaii> DualSuck 3 comes with many pussy and mouth shaped extensions
[00:47] <ddkawaii> one o them (rumor only) is hsaped like Orin's mouth
[00:47] <sp0rsk> ooooooh ffxiii 360 is not coming out in japan?
[00:47] <sp0rsk> lol
[00:47] <mrsolo> this is getting weird
[00:47] <Tiduzlaptop> Wolverine O face attachment
[00:47] <ddkawaii> the other (rumor only, but likely) is shaped like Gaime's
[00:48] <Azih> yeah they're porting at the same time as they're localising
[00:48] <MaddenNFL64> I can't believe MS didn't have a xmote up its sleeve. Nintendo released their preemptive strike, with bad intel... It's Iraq all over again!
[00:48] <EGM92> iapetus I never touched the screws myself. I remember leaving the HDD on my coffee table, with my toolbox, my girlfriend stayed home, at lunch I got a call asking if I would void the warranty taking out the HDD I said no, when I got home, she was transfering my music albums to the PS3.
[00:48] <Azih> and you better believe MS will be throwing tons of software engineers at Sony to help out
[00:48] <ddkawaii> gaime's mom ordered the first 15k gaime fashioned dual sucks
[00:48] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> SE probably would have scrapped FFXIII next gen and done FFXIII wii if they hadn't already invested so much money in the engine and assets
[00:48] <EGM92> 500GB's is a great thing to have, I have over 350gb free
[00:48] <ddkawaii> qht
[00:48] <iapetus> In that case either your girlfriend is pretty good with a hacksaw, or *she* got the Geisha girls.
[00:48] <ddkawaii> why
[00:48] <ddkawaii> FF13 is PC
[00:48] <ddkawaii> so it will work fine on 360
[00:48] <Azih> aahhhh, tru
[00:48] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> no I mean, comparing the HD market to the wii market
[00:48] <Oldschoolgamer> is either one going to be on pc?
[00:48] <ddkawaii> in truth, in doing it on PC first, FF13 will require minimum work
[00:49] <Azih> inanycase MS will be throwing mad marketing money at FFXIII
[00:49] <ddkawaii> Last Remnant is PC
[00:49] * Lo-Volt has joined #GA
[00:49] <ddkawaii> and FF13 will be too
[00:49] <Oldschoolgamer> nice
[00:49] <sp0rsk> ms conference seems to have been pretty lame
[00:49] <MaddenNFL64> Ya, their building FF13 on the PC first, then porting over to xbox. Thats how Capcom does their stuff nowadays too.
[00:49] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> they probably expected PS3 to do much better than it did
[00:49] <ddkawaii> in a interview in news paper
[00:49] <Lo-Volt> Hi, guys, what did I miss?
[00:49] <sp0rsk> where the fuck was that one game with the euro dude?
[00:49] <ddkawaii> wada said square was going to give up on exclusives
[00:49] * impirius has left #GA
[00:49] <ddkawaii> and go fully multiplatform
[00:49] <ddkawaii> becuase they need $$
[00:49] <MaddenNFL64> Tears of joy, of sadness.
[00:49] <ddkawaii> and becaues crystal tools is a PC engine
[00:49] <Tiduzlaptop> then where is my star ocean 3 ddkawaii ?
[00:49] <ddkawaii> so it makes snese
[00:49] * mrsolo feels a urge to buy something to decorate his new tv
[00:49] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> and then when they realize it didn't, they were so far into development that it made more sense to go multiplatform than go to the Wii
[00:49] <mrsolo> xbox360? htpc?
[00:49] <ddkawaii> if the game is NOT using crystal tools
[00:49] * GreatDave has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[00:49] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> at leas tthat would be my guess
[00:49] <mrsolo> monster cables?
[00:50] <ddkawaii> it doesnt get multiplat treatment
[00:50] <Tiduzlaptop> :/
[00:50] <ddkawaii> crystal tools is their "premier" (his words not mine) engine
[00:50] <ddkawaii> and yes he used the english weord "premier" in the japnaese interview
[00:50] <Azih> easy portage from PC to 360 is one hell of a trump card that MS has for cash starved devs

[00:50] <ddkawaii> haha
[00:50] <EGM92> I really don't see what the problem is with FF13 on the 360, if Lost Oddysee is anything to go by it won't sell well on the 360. Personally I have 2 360's and 1 PS3 and I'll buy it on PS3 just because the PS3 is guarenteed not to Red Ring on me.

[00:51] <Azih> get a 3rd party to play along like that.
[00:51] <ddkawaii> iap -fedor's english is HILARIOUS
[00:52] <iapetus> I wouldn't want to tell him that.
[00:52] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> "Thanks for coming.....   ...   Before you leave here's a zelda trailer"

[00:52] <ddkawaii> hahah
[00:52] <Lo-Volt> That's what I think too.
[00:52] <Azih> this was better
[00:52] <ddkawaii> i cant wait till his fight
[00:52] <EviLore> ddk: fedor vs tim sylvia, should be hot
[00:52] <ddkawaii> its on the 19th right?
[00:52] <Ed> or at least sell the 60 gig HD cheaper.
[00:52] <ddkawaii> YESSS
[00:52] <ddkawaii> 19th right?
[00:52] <Lo-Volt> Must really sting if you have a Core.
[00:52] <EviLore> yes
[00:52] <Lo-Volt> Nice job.
[00:52] <Ed> I like the idea of Netflix 360
[00:52] <EviLore> 19th
[00:52] <ddkawaii> FUCK YES
[00:52] <Azih> this was better because hopes had been raised and dashed just a few seconds before
[00:52] <ddkawaii> that will be a good fight
[00:52] <EviLore> along with some other cool fights
[00:52] <MaddenNFL64> Ya, reminded me of the before you go... from reggie lol.
[00:52] <ddkawaii> although, i dont think its a good matchup for sylvia
[00:52] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> wonder if we'll finally see the unveiling of a bunch of big 3rd party wii titles tomorrow
[00:52] <Lo-Volt> But the idea of a full full install is a good thing.
[00:52] <iapetus> But the best language thing was for the adoption of the verb 'to privatise' as privatizirovat', meaning 'to steal'.
[00:52] <Lo-Volt> If it doesn't kill HDDs.
[00:52] <ddkawaii> i dont see how sylvia avoids getting taken down
[00:53] <Lo-Volt> I mean, if they did that day one, I might have kept my 360.
[00:53] <iapetus> Idea is good, but unless they want to give me a huge HD for free, implementation is bad.
[00:53] <Lo-Volt> Agreed.
[00:53] <sp0rsk> wait
[00:53] <Azih> yar, Pro/Premium are tard packs now
[00:53] <MaddenNFL64> Oh, Affliction right?
[00:53] <sp0rsk> fedor is going ot ufc?!
[00:53] <iapetus> How many games can you install on a standard 20G 360?
[00:53] <Lo-Volt> But the moment they released a Core, well, it was bound to get messy as hell.
[00:53] <ddkawaii> no
[00:53] <Azih> which is probably why they're clearing them out
[00:53] <Lo-Volt> 2.
[00:53] <iapetus> One, that's how many.
[00:53] <ddkawaii> its a differnet promotion
[00:53] <ddkawaii> not ufc
[00:53] <EviLore> affliction "banned" or some crap
[00:53] <sp0rsk> oh
[00:53] <MaddenNFL64> Sylvia aint with UFC anymore
[00:53] <Azih> the 60 gig is minimum
[00:53] <Lo-Volt> Now the Elite makes sense all of a sudden!
[00:53] <Lo-Volt> :/
[00:53] <sp0rsk> are people abandoning  ufc then?
[00:53] <sp0rsk> iii seee
[00:54] <iapetus> Because the rest of the space is used for XBLA stuff.
[00:54] <ddkawaii> fedor is gonna fight this fight
[00:54] <Azih> there better be no freaking mandatory installs though
[00:54] <ddkawaii> and if he wins
[00:54] <Azih> I swear
[00:54] <iapetus> I had to free up space to install one.
[00:54] <ddkawaii> the couture thing is pretty much a done deal
[00:54] <Azih> GALAGA
[00:54] <EviLore> fedor is going to make sylvia cry
[00:54] <ddkawaii> couture will be out of his contract by the time fedor is ready to fight again
[00:54] <Lo-Volt> I think once the option becomes available to developers, some will make installs mandatory.
[00:54] <ddkawaii> evil - sylvia seems to really thing he is gonna stand with fedor
[00:54] <frod> don't think it's an in-game option
[00:54] * JoeMolotov has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[00:54] <ddkawaii> evil - sylvia is not a bad guy
[00:54] <frod> more like a dash option
[00:54] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> I don't think we'll ever see free online multiplayer on an Xbox game console
[00:54] <ddkawaii> but he's gonna get hurt if he tries that
[00:54] <ddkawaii> especially considering his last two fight
[00:54] <Azih> yar, MS is making money
[00:55] <ddkawaii> he didn't bother protecting his wheels at all
[00:55] <ddkawaii> :-/
[00:55] <Azih> not going to mess with something that's making them money
[00:55] <EviLore> fedor fears no man, has the best gameplans of any mma fighter, is as strong as a bear, has accurate flurries of striking and top class submissions.  sylvia is big and goofy.
[00:55] <MaddenNFL64> All I can remember of Sylvia anymore is the total asskicking he got from Couture.
[00:55] <Azih> plus they've already declared victory over Sony, which is all they really cared about.
[00:55] <Lo-Volt> I'm somewhat surprised FF13 went to the 360, but it does make fair sense.
[00:55] <Azih> Shit, MS is all ACCOMPLISHED! right now.
[00:55] <Lo-Volt> Why give up North Americans by keeping it single-platform?
[00:55] <sp0rsk> i think the impact of ffxiii being announced for 360 is lessened by the fact everyone here has been saying its coming for a long time
[00:55] <ddkawaii> im not sure how sylvia plans on attackinghim
[00:55] <sp0rsk> on top of hte fact the game still doesnt exist
[00:56] <Azih> They wanted to keep Sony from taking over the living room and that's happened.
[00:56] <ddkawaii> i like sylvia against several people
[00:56] <Azih> now they're making money
[00:56] <ddkawaii> against fedor
[00:56] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> now
[00:56] <ddkawaii> i think its a bad matchup for sylvia
[00:56] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> Tomorrow
[00:56] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> Mother 3
[00:56] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> Believe
[00:56] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> :(
[00:56] <Oldschoolgamer> nice
[00:56] <Lo-Volt> I wonder what Sony's conference will be like...
[00:56] <Oldschoolgamer> the EA conference is getting ready to start
[00:56] <Azih> sp0rsk: I never believed it though
[00:56] <EviLore> ddk: sylvia will throw a few punches, try a high kick, get hit in the face really hard and taken down, rear naked choke or armbarred, GG.
[00:56] <ddkawaii> btw
[00:56] <iapetus> I know nothing of MMA, but if there's one thing I have learned over the years it is this:
[00:56] <ddkawaii> i hate how the fans treat sylvia
[00:56] <iapetus> 'Sylvia' is a girl's name.
[00:57] <iapetus> End of discussion.
[00:57] <ddkawaii> he deserves more respect than that
[00:57] <Oldschoolgamer> damn, shitty feed os shitty
[00:57] <EviLore> it's his last name ;b
[00:57] <sp0rsk> well, when people from sqen are like hahaha ps3 exclusive, i guess i should believe them from now on
[00:57] <MaddenNFL64> UFC lhw is so stacked man. They even gimped the middlewight div to put Silva at 205.
[00:57] <EviLore> tim sylvia
[00:57] <ddkawaii> actually
[00:57] <ddkawaii> i sorta hate ufc fans
[00:57] <ddkawaii> they like boo and sutff
[00:57] <ddkawaii> which REALLY pisses me off
[00:57] <EviLore> yeah, the booing is lame
[00:57] <ddkawaii> ;-(
[00:57] <EviLore> pride crowds were extremely enthusiastic and respectful
[00:57] <EviLore> ;(
[00:57] <MaddenNFL64> Thats what your breath smell like. BOO BOO
[00:57] <iapetus> I don't care if it's his last name. If I were called Iapetus Lucy, then I would still have a girl's name.
[00:57] <sp0rsk> to ufc fans, every time you lose your whole record becomes "a bunch of cans, never fought anyone good"
[00:57] <ddkawaii> also
[00:57] <ddkawaii> one thing is
[00:58] <DrForester> just got home, what did i miss from microsoft today?
[00:58] <DrForester> any megatons?
[00:58] <ddkawaii> the nog fight
[00:58] <ddkawaii> was prettyt epic
[00:58] <MaddenNFL64> Hmm. Maybe
[00:58] <ddkawaii> it was sylvia's best fight
[00:58] <ddkawaii> IMO
[00:58] <DrForester> nog fight?
[00:58] <Tiduzlaptop> so, is there a HD version of ffxiii trailerout? :p
[00:58] <ddkawaii> haha
[00:58] <sp0rsk> not yet Tiduzlaptop
[00:58] <iapetus> DrForester: You're jesting, right?
[00:58] <EviLore> yeah, ufc fans immediately drop anyone who loses a fight.  because the UFC doesn't have its fighters fight all that often, and it doesn't take many fights to get a title shot if you're chosen for the fast track
[00:58] <Tiduzlaptop> DrForester: FFXIII on 360
[00:58] <Tiduzlaptop> thanks sp0rsk
[00:59] <MaddenNFL64> Isnt it the same trailer for PS3? I think its the same cut.
[00:59] <DrForester> lolz
[00:59] <ddkawaii> lol@ ufc fans
[00:59] <Tiduzlaptop> it definately had some new stuff
[00:59] <DrForester> wow, ffxiii i woudl have bet money on MGS4 first
[00:59] <Tiduzlaptop> and its direct feed <3
[00:59] <iapetus> No, seriously FFXIII on 360.
[00:59] <Lo-Volt> Looks like the announcement was done for some shock value like Zelda back in 2004 or 5?
[00:59] <Lo-Volt> WAIT WE'RE NOT FINISHED.
[00:59] <iapetus> GOOD BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID FUCK ALL WORTH LISTENING TO SO FAR.
[00:59] <MaddenNFL64> Hey can we openly speculate on MGS4 going to 360 now? I know its banned now but...
[00:59] <Lo-Volt> :D LOL.
[00:59] <ddkawaii> evil what did you think of the nog fight?
[00:59] <iapetus> MaddenNFL64: Let's just say you might want to be careful with how you openly speculate on it.
[01:00] <ddkawaii> that was his best and most crowd pleasing fight
[01:00] <EviLore> I haven't seen it ddk
[01:00] <ddkawaii> (sylvia) that is
[01:00] <ddkawaii> oh
[01:00] <EviLore> sylvia beat nog?
[01:00] <ddkawaii> no
[01:00] <ddkawaii> he lost
[01:00] <ddkawaii> but
[01:00] <EviLore> ah
[01:00] <ddkawaii> it was the first time he didn't look clumsy
[01:00] <ddkawaii> and stall
[01:00] <ddkawaii> he went right at nog
[01:00] <Tiduzlaptop> Am i the only one who doesnt like the look of new 360 blades?
[01:00] <ddkawaii> and got unlucky
[01:00] <Tiduzlaptop> :p
[01:00] <EviLore> oh, I'll have to watch it
[01:00] <ddkawaii> and got subbed
[01:00] <mrsolo> so
[01:00] <ddkawaii> yeah
[01:00] <EviLore> nog rox
[01:00] <ddkawaii> watch it
[01:00] <ddkawaii> nog got fucke dup
[01:00] <ddkawaii> but caught him 
[01:00] <ddkawaii> and subbed him
[01:00] <EviLore> wait, who's the ufc heavyweight champ right now?  I don't even know
[01:00] <ddkawaii> like nog does
[01:00] <mrsolo> is pixeljunk at E3?
[01:00] <ddkawaii> nog
[01:00] <EviLore> ah
[01:00] <ddkawaii> is interim champ
[01:00] <ddkawaii> 'cause counture is gone
[01:01] * jakehk has joined #GA
[01:01] <ddkawaii> randy's gonna get out of his contract tho
[01:01] <ddkawaii> usually i hate contract breakers
[01:01] <Lo-Volt> mrsolo: who cares?
[01:01] <EviLore> which event was this fight, hard to look it up without hitting full spoilers of the event
[01:01] <ddkawaii> but dana's a dick
[01:01] <mrsolo> probably not..E3 costs too much for them
[01:01] <Lo-Volt> E3 is already over.
[01:01] * JoeMolotov has joined #GA
[01:01] <ddkawaii> ufc 81
[01:01] <ddkawaii> uhhh
[01:01] <sp0rsk> ahahahahah i just noticed my tag
[01:01] <ddkawaii> maybe....breaking points?
[01:01] <Tiduzlaptop> God of war 3 is not shown
[01:01] <DrForester> so is 360 getting both FFXIII's?
[01:01] <EviLore> 81? k
[01:01] <Tiduzlaptop> therefore e3 is not over.
[01:01] <Tiduzlaptop> DrForester: versus is exclusive to ps3.
[01:01] <Tiduzlaptop> FOR NOW
[01:01] <Lo-Volt> DrF: we only know of XIII.
[01:02] <MaddenNFL64> No versus. Not yet anyway
[01:02] <Oldschoolgamer> this g4 stream is horrible
[01:02] <Oldschoolgamer> ugh
[01:02] <Tiduzlaptop> sp0rsk whats your tag
[01:02] <Tiduzlaptop> lol
[01:02] <ddkawaii> man
[01:02] <ddkawaii> nog is amazing
[01:02] <Oldschoolgamer> anyone know if there is another stream for EA stuff?
[01:02] <sp0rsk> force push the doodoo rock
[01:02] <ddkawaii> but i worry for his health
[01:02] <ddkawaii> as an old man
[01:02] <ddkawaii> :-(
[01:02] <ddkawaii> he's taken so many terrible beatings
[01:02] <Tiduzlaptop> LMAO
[01:02] <EviLore> nog is a fucking awesome fighter.  
[01:02] <EviLore> he's made of iron
[01:02] <ddkawaii> only fedor is better
[01:02] <Lo-Volt> I think the only thing for Sony to "win E3" is pull a "$299" Mark II.
[01:02] <Tiduzlaptop> Date the ban will be lifted: 07-14-2008, 10:00 PM
[01:02] <ddkawaii> IMO of course
[01:02] <Tiduzlaptop> in how many hours is that?
[01:02] <Lo-Volt> 4.
[01:02] <EviLore> well, now that mirko lost to fucking scrubs, yeah
[01:02] <EviLore> heh
[01:02] <Tiduzlaptop> ty
[01:03] <ddkawaii> WELLL
[01:03] <ddkawaii> octagon != ring
[01:03] <EviLore> even so, disappointing
[01:03] <Lo-Volt> NP.
[01:03] <ddkawaii> mirko is totaly out of place in octagon
[01:03] <EviLore> mirko still owns though
[01:03] <Lo-Volt> 4 hours Eastern, BTW.
[01:03] <ddkawaii> his movement was terrible
[01:03] <EviLore> yeah
[01:03] <MaddenNFL64> cro cop... was it cuz he got off the juice? I always hear that ;p
[01:03] <ddkawaii> crocops body looked the same
[01:03] <DrForester> what happens if nintendo annoucned FFXIII tomorrow too?  epic lulz?
[01:03] <EviLore> yeah
[01:03] <ddkawaii> his body didnt change at all
[01:03] <ddkawaii> i doubt he was juicing
[01:03] <iapetus> Versus has been explicitly confirmed as still exclusive.
[01:03] <EviLore> and I've seen mirko's training videos, he's extremely hardcore
[01:03] <EviLore> *shrug*
[01:03] <Tiduzlaptop> http://images.gamersyde.com/gallery/public/8895/1695_0007.jpg

[01:04] <ddkawaii> that said
[01:04] <Lo-Volt> Starring Gackt no matter which damn version.
[01:04] <Tiduzlaptop> *dreams on*
[01:04] <ddkawaii> im gonna go watch mirko at the next DREAM event
[01:04] <ddkawaii> so :-)
[01:05] <ddkawaii> btw
[01:05] <ddkawaii> i hope kongo fights soon
[01:05] <EviLore> but yeah, nog is awesome, that one highlight reel ground and pound punch that fedor did to him was like the most powerful punch I've ever seen from that position, and nog took it without any damage.  seriously, the dude's scary.  not to mention his childhood history
[01:05] <ddkawaii> i want to see him get his ass beat
[01:05] <ddkawaii> haha
[01:05] <ddkawaii> kongo talks waaaayyy too much shit
[01:05] <ddkawaii> haha
[01:05] <BlueTsunami> New dashboard = slick
[01:05] <ddkawaii> yeah
[01:05] <Dan_THUGGla> umm anywhere else streaming the EA thing?
[01:05] <ddkawaii> btw
[01:05] <Dan_THUGGla> g4tv.com is shit
[01:05] <BlueTsunami> Though, I still like XMB
[01:05] <ddkawaii> the only thing i dont like about nog
[01:06] <ddkawaii> is that he talked shit about bob sapp
[01:06] * mac has quit IRC (Quit: Later)
[01:06] <ddkawaii> because uhh in their fight
[01:06] * Renzer has joined #GA
[01:06] <ddkawaii> bob, if he had dropped him, may have snapped his neck
[01:06] <ddkawaii> and bob didn't do it
[01:06] <BlueTsunami> Gamespot feed ftw
[01:06] <ddkawaii> and after the fight nog was all nice
[01:06] <ddkawaii> but when he returned home
[01:06] <ddkawaii> started talking shit about bob 
[01:06] <ddkawaii> :-(
[01:06] <sp0rsk> hwaorang?
[01:06] <BlueTsunami> IGN was on a Delay, G4 was stuttering shit and Gamespot worked with a few hiccups
[01:06] <MaddenNFL64> bob sapp punches like a girl. but if that swing ever connects.. damn.
[01:06] <ddkawaii> if you are gonna talk shit, say it to a dude's face
[01:06] <EviLore> bob's not exactly a top class mma fighter ddk
[01:06] <Lo-Volt> How was 1UP's feed?
[01:06] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> Blue:  that's why you get a TV
[01:06] <Lo-Volt> LOL.
[01:06] <ddkawaii> evil - watch their fight
[01:07] <EviLore> I have
[01:07] <EviLore> many times ;b
[01:07] <ddkawaii> evil - bob had him up and was going to slam him
[01:07] <ddkawaii> and bob didn't
[01:07] <ddkawaii> bob just dropped him
[01:07] <ddkawaii> he did that because he was afraid of snapping his neck
[01:07] <ddkawaii> haha
[01:07] <BlueTsunami> Gaime: Yeah, I was looking for my local G4 channel and couldn't find it :( Lo-Volt: Not sure, didn't know 1up had a feed
[01:07] <EviLore> well you know killing the opponent by neck snap probably wouldn't result in a clean win
[01:07] <Lo-Volt> I'm assuming the 1UP feed was shit if it happened.
[01:07] <EviLore> mma isn't a street fight, still has rules
[01:07] <MaddenNFL64> Need Kumate rules.
[01:08] <Lo-Volt> BBS, urgent errand.
[01:08] <ddkawaii> bim just saying
[01:08] <stump> g4 fed is sooo bad
[01:08] <ddkawaii> nog was all nice aright after
[01:08] <ddkawaii> but talked shit back in his home country
[01:08] <ddkawaii> that's pretty shitty if you ask me
[01:08] <EviLore> eh, dude, ignore the trash talk bullshit
[01:08] <ddkawaii> talking trash = :-(
[01:08] <ddkawaii> especially when someone was nice to you
[01:08] <ddkawaii> sorta like how i can't forgive gaime's bitch ass
[01:09] <ddkawaii> :-P
[01:09] * soakrates has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)

[01:09] <Dan_THUGGla> works like shit!
[01:09] <ddkawaii> wow
[01:09] <BlueTsunami> Star Ocean 4 trailer
[01:09] <MaddenNFL64> I tried the g4 feed for the conference, and it kept dying. went with the delayed but clean IGN feed.
[01:09] <BlueTsunami> :bow
[01:10] <BlueTsunami> motha fucken :bow
[01:10] <BlueTsunami> http://www.gamersyde.com/news_6778_en.html
[01:10] <Dan_THUGGla> i'm talking about the EA thing now!
[01:10] <ddkawaii> evil - ugh
[01:10] <ddkawaii> how'd mirko lose to gonzaga?
[01:10] <ddkawaii> i saw the Fabricio Werdum /Gonzaga fight recently
[01:10] <MaddenNFL64> head kick if I recall.
[01:10] <EviLore> still shaking my head at that shit ddk
[01:10] <ddkawaii> and he looked TERRIIBBBLLLLEEE
[01:10] <jakehk> whats the ign feed link
[01:11] <ddkawaii> Gonzaga looked terrible against Werdum
[01:11] <ddkawaii> like wtf
[01:11] <DMczaf> SimAnimals!
[01:11] <ddkawaii> Werdum is pretty good though
[01:11] <EviLore> regardless, nog is still awesome.   I remember a few years back rickson gracie, the all-talk tool that he is, said that nog had garbage BJJ, heh.  and well in a sense he's right, nog doesn't follow pure bjj principles of avoiding damage and acting defensively in guard, locking them up and such, but nog is a fucking master at implementing his BJJ effectively in an mma environment
[01:11] <EviLore> fuckin' rickson
[01:11] * JoeMolotov has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[01:11] <ddkawaii> part of nog's thing is
[01:12] <ddkawaii> he invites dudes in to make mistakes
[01:12] <ddkawaii> hes alot like fedor actually
[01:12] * soakrates has quit IRC (Quit: )
[01:12] <ddkawaii> the only difference is fed takes less damage
[01:12] <ddkawaii> usually
[01:12] <ddkawaii> haha
[01:12] <Dan_THUGGla> Fox vs. Bear
[01:12] <EviLore> "here, unload on my face...ARMBAR BITCH!"
[01:12] <ddkawaii> like  Hongman
[01:12] <ddkawaii> lol
[01:12] <ddkawaii> fedor just opened up and let himself take like 4 punches
[01:12] <ddkawaii> then
[01:12] <ddkawaii> armbizzar
[01:12] <sp0rsk> man every time i see the news, it sounds like the states is entering the great depression part 2
[01:12] * rotaryspirit has joined #GA
[01:12] <sp0rsk> people waiting  in droves to take their money out of banks and shit
[01:13] <ddkawaii> that's wont happen
[01:13] <ddkawaii> usa has negative savings rate
[01:13] <ddkawaii> no money in banks
[01:13] <ddkawaii> lulz
[01:13] <EviLore> yeah sporks, if more banks collapse and oil prices keep rising, we're in trouble. 
[01:13] <ddkawaii> no
[01:13] <ddkawaii> bernake saved fannie and freddie
[01:13] <ddkawaii> stupid but they did it
[01:13] <ddkawaii> they siad no more
[01:13] <ddkawaii> but i know they will
[01:13] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> I think the solution is to bomb Iran
[01:13] <sp0rsk> im worried about my savings, to be honest
[01:13] <ddkawaii> the only problem we may have
[01:13] <ddkawaii> is inflation
[01:13] <ddkawaii> inflatin may get bad
[01:13] <ddkawaii> real bad
[01:14] <ddkawaii> and when obama takes over
[01:14] <ddkawaii> we'll have some jimmy carter like years
[01:14] <ddkawaii> republicans always do this
[01:14] <ddkawaii> :-)
[01:14] <EviLore> sporks: everything's FDIC insured.  if things get bad though the value of the dollar will get even shittier.
[01:14] <ddkawaii> fuck up
[01:14] <ddkawaii> then drop it into lap of next prez
[01:14] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> I am seriously worried that this administration is going to attack Iran before the end of the year
[01:14] <ddkawaii> who gets the blam
[01:14] <ddkawaii> then republicans get back in
[01:14] <ddkawaii> also
[01:14] <ddkawaii> what's amazing
[01:14] <ddkawaii> is they're talking about another stimulus pakckage
[01:14] <ddkawaii> !!!

[01:15] <ddkawaii> why do they lways want short term fixes
[01:15] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> is that a motionplus+nunchaku attachment?
[01:15] <ddkawaii> are people so dumb they're not abe to hear the cold hard truth
[01:16] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> ddk:  because short term fixes = election victoly

[01:16] <ddkawaii> :-(
[01:16] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> indeed

[01:23] <EviLore> 3:13 - Rod has confirmed animal sex in this game.
[01:23] <EviLore> 3:13 - Coming January 2009 exclusively for Wii and DS

[01:24] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> http://www.explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Matt/spiked-drink.png    O_o
[01:24] <sp0rsk> the nintendo real motion controller thingie makes me think AC will not be a big announcement at E3
[01:24] <Oldschoolgamer> and its on pc too
[01:24] <Tiduzlaptop> and i think itll scare the shit outta me
[01:24] <Shuri> or is that happening tomorrow?
[01:24] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> Shuri: because it's tomorrow
[01:24] <ddkawaii> tid - i dont really care about gfx
[01:24] <ddkawaii> :-P
[01:24] <sp0rsk> nintendo always announces peripherals with a big game
[01:24] <Oldschoolgamer> I think I might get it on that and use my headphones
[01:24] <ddkawaii> unless they get in the way
[01:24] <Dan_THUGGla> Battlefield 19!
[01:24] <Tiduzlaptop> :P

[01:25] <Tiduzlaptop> Im a gfx whore i guess

[01:25] <atomsk> mirror's edge is up
[01:25] <Tiduzlaptop> but a gameplay whore too
[01:25] <ddkawaii> im a framerate whore
[01:25] <Rorschach> mirror's edge sweet

[01:25] <MaddenNFL64> You cover the wiimote in a plastic shell shaped like a raccoon.
[01:25] <Tiduzlaptop> GTA IV is a good example for BAD framerate
[01:25] <atomsk> first person adventure!
[01:26] <Oldschoolgamer> later ddk
[01:26] <Ed> you know, with the amount of battlefield sequels and spinoffs EA is pushing out, we'll see a Battlefield 1942 sometime in the future regardless of the setting.
[01:26] <Tiduzlaptop> Rockband 2
[01:26] <Tiduzlaptop> blew me away.
[01:26] <EviLore> wow @ jeff green's liveblog of the EA conference, haha
[01:26] <Tiduzlaptop> and im still getting gh4 as well
[01:26] <EviLore> "Now they're showing how your Sim really lives in the community with all the other Sims, which you would know already if you read the last issue of Games for Windows: The Official Magazine, cuz we had that stuff in the issue.  But of course you didn't buy it, which is why the mag no longer exists, which is why I am sitting here live blogging. Thanks assholes"

[01:30] <Rorschach> what happened with south park...I missed that
[01:30] <Tiduzlaptop> Rorschach: only cartman talking
[01:30] <Tiduzlaptop> no footage
[01:30] <Rorschach> haha
[01:30] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> therer was like a 2 second "trailer" of south park XBLA
[01:30] <Dan_THUGGla> it's a XBLA port of Chef's Luv Shack
[01:30] <Dan_THUGGla> shhh
[01:30] <atomsk> i would laugh if they just ported the n64 game to xbla
[01:31] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> which one
[01:31] <atomsk> the first one. lol
[01:31] <MaddenNFL64> Ya, no footage of it though. Wonder what it could be.
[01:31] <Rorschach> can't wait for a high res version of this trailer...yummm
[01:31] <Rorschach> om nom nom
[01:31] <soakrates_GGPO> oh boy Fallout 3 trailer
[01:31] * Acosta has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[01:31] <Rorschach> fallout 3 looks like concentrated shit :(
[01:31] <Dan_THUGGla> Fallout Boy?
[01:32] <syllogism> fallout 3 looks fine
[01:32] <Rorschach> ugh maxis ass kissing coming up
[01:32] * Rorschach closes
[01:32] <atomsk> WILL
[01:32] <syllogism> you would be all over it if it wasnt fallout 3
[01:32] <sp0rsk> jeff greens blog is awesome
[01:32] <atomsk> PEE ON US WILL
[01:32] <Rorschach> SPORE WILL SUCK!
[01:32] <DMczaf> holy shit, mirror's edge gimme gimme gimme
[01:32] <Shuri> fallout 3 looks awesome
[01:32] <Rorschach> yes dm
[01:32] <Rorschach> :bow
[01:32] <EviLore> it looks pretty bad, syll.  the guns don't even move when they fire and enemies don't react at all unless they die
[01:32] <EviLore> and the vats crap looked pretty lame
[01:32] <Shuri> i'm more hyped about fallout3 than any other game
[01:32] <syllogism> i only saw the second trailer
[01:32] <EviLore> and it looked like an oblivion total conversion
[01:32] <Shuri> oblivion + mad max = :D
[01:33] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> http://www.explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Dave/comicslavelabor1.png
[01:33] <Rorschach> syllogism: watch the gameplay stuff from the conference
[01:33] <Rorschach> then come back to me
[01:33] <Rorschach> with those statements
[01:33] <syllogism> it looks like you would expect a 3d game look like
[01:33] <Rorschach> I meant gameplay
[01:33] <syllogism> link
[01:33] <Rorschach> not really graphics
[01:33] <Rorschach> you'll have to wait for the sites to put it up :|
[01:33] <MaddenNFL64> I actually didn't like the VATS stuff. Pausing the game, and attacking turn based. eh. I'll probably play straight up.
[01:33] <Rorschach> it was live
[01:33] <syllogism> i'm sure it's up
[01:33] * Acosta has joined #GA
[01:33] <syllogism> dont make me go to gametrailers
[01:34] * jakehk has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[01:34] <EviLore> graphically it looks good enough, no real complaints there though the art direction, I dunno, need to see more.  texture packs and all that will fix the pc version anyway graphically
[01:34] * jakehk has joined #GA
[01:35] <soakrates_GGPO> peace
[01:35] <soakrates_GGPO> freedom
[01:35] <soakrates_GGPO> and bacon and eggs
[01:35] <EviLore> the fights didn't seem intense, interesting, or dangerous at all
[01:35] <Rorschach> the gunplay looks really bad...and the guy resorted to just turn based gameplay complete with cutscenes...it was like ffxiii all over again
[01:35] <Rorschach> er
[01:35] <Rorschach> ffviii
[01:35] <frod> tunnel play
[01:35] <syllogism> fallout 1-2 fights werent intense
[01:35] <EviLore> "IT NEVER GETS OLD" though!
[01:35] <MaddenNFL64> I think the Beth president was just shitty at playing FPS style
[01:35] <atomsk> g4 ea feed died on me. damn
[01:35] <Daw> hav u ever went and met someone and they have been downright nasty to your face?
[01:35] <Viz> 38% of GOD
[01:35] * Daw has quit IRC (Quit: )
[01:35] <Rorschach> IT'S OBLIVION SET IN THE FUTURE
[01:35] <Rorschach> DAY ONE
[01:36] <EviLore> I suppose we played different games then syll, unless you grab the power armor every time in the first 15 minutes, you powergaming whore you!
[01:36] <syllogism> in fact most combat in fallout games was pretty bad
[01:36] <Tiduzlaptop> http://www.gamersyde.com/leech_7791_en.html
[01:36] <Tiduzlaptop> gameplay re5
[01:36] <Shuri> haha
[01:36] <syllogism> i just watched the demonstration, they showed very little
[01:36] <Rorschach> you did not...in such a small amount of time
[01:36] <Shuri> that 'bloody mess' trailer of fallout 3 on gametrailers is awesome so far
[01:36] <Rorschach> LIAR
[01:36] <Dan_THUGGla> haaaaaaaaa
[01:36] <syllogism> yes I did
[01:36] <Dan_THUGGla> the g4tv stream died
[01:36] <syllogism> I skipped the parts with no fighting
[01:37] <Oldschoolgamer> "Right now we have about two million creatures. The number of unique creatures in Spore has now exceeded the total known species on earth."
[01:37] <MaddenNFL64> It was so wierd though, seeing the guy toss a grenade, then having the robot shoot back in a cutscene style. Threw me off.
[01:37] <syllogism> also fallout didnt even have ai
[01:37] <Oldschoolgamer> and how many are dick monsters
[01:37] <EviLore> osg: lawlawl
[01:37] <syllogism> everything just ran straight at you
[01:37] <syllogism> so i guess it's living up to the previous games
[01:37] <syllogism> you should be happy
[01:37] <Shuri> the game still has lot of time until its released
[01:37] <Rorschach> aim at a body part, watch the cutscene, move to next thing
[01:37] <EviLore> trollin'
[01:37] <Tiduzlaptop> Oldschoolgamer: 1.8 million.
[01:38] <Oldschoolgamer> rofl
[01:38] <Rorschach> spore will suck...epic backlash
[01:38] <soakrates_GGPO> yeah, sorry
[01:38] <soakrates_GGPO> Fallout 3 looks awesome
[01:38] <EviLore> yeah every enemy died with a successful vats target
[01:38] <soakrates_GGPO> judging by the HD trailer
[01:38] <syllogism> it's a trailer
[01:38] * Renzer has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[01:38] <Shuri> yeah im watching the e3 demo video.. its pretty neat so far
[01:38] <Rorschach> yeah, sorry, but you're wrong!
[01:38] <atomsk> g4 feed working again for me
[01:38] <syllogism> I HATE FALLOUT 3
[01:38] <atomsk> well, working is a relative term
[01:38] <syllogism> more like fallout brotherhood of steel
[01:38] * MrPing1000 prays to the gods of nwa
[01:39] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> Also
[01:39] <MrPing1000> or rather nma
[01:39] <soakrates_GGPO> I mean I'm not gonna say it's GOING to be awesome
[01:39] <MrPing1000> not niggers with attitude
[01:39] <syllogism> the dialogue trees i've seen so far have been pretty bad though
[01:39] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> what's with the new Viva Pinata  taking a page from Eye of Judgment
[01:39] <syllogism> now that's a reason to complain
[01:39] <soakrates_GGPO> syllogism: that's my main concern
[01:39] <MrPing1000> that b-movie game looks like a big old pile of steaming crap
[01:40] <MaddenNFL64> EazyE said whats up
[01:40] * OrinX slaps MrPing1000 around a bit with a large trout
[01:40] <Shuri> hahaha
[01:40] * OrinX slaps MrPing1000 around a bit with a large trout
[01:40] * OrinX slaps MrPing1000 around a bit with a large trout
[01:40] * OrinX slaps MrPing1000 around a bit with a large trout
[01:40] <atomsk> YER IN DA MOVIES
[01:40] <Shuri> holy shit, the combat shotgun
[01:40] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> ... has anyone checked the nintendo press site?
[01:40] * Shuri preorders
[01:40] <soakrates_GGPO> the combat looks fun enough and everything
[01:40] <MrPing1000> wut orin
[01:40] * MrPing1000 takes it like a bitch
[01:40] <Rorschach> spore's art takes a page straight out of Rare's book
[01:40] <Rorschach> there, I said it
[01:40] <EviLore> holy shit the combat shotgun....does not move at all when you fire it
[01:40] <Shuri> i have no idea what people are talking about, this looks amazing so far
[01:40] <atomsk> krome working on another 360 sequel
[01:40] <soakrates_GGPO> but the fun of a Fallout game really depends on its atmosphere and stuff
[01:40] <Shuri> i love the vat stuff
[01:41] <Shuri> where you can aim and you get a cutscene
[01:41] <EviLore> ...
[01:41] <MrPing1000> the world of fallout 3 looks reasonably interesting, well it sorta has to be, this isn't meadows and trees with the odd monster her and there
[01:41] <MrPing1000> but I fear for it
[01:41] <MaddenNFL64> The combat shotgun was meh... But I never thought that the bow shooting in OB was a sim. I'll get over it.
[01:41] <MrPing1000> nma are going to be vindicated
[01:41] * OrinX sets mode: +v Lelielle
[01:41] <soakrates_GGPO> fuck combat shotgun
[01:41] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> orinrin
[01:41] <Shuri> i wonder if the world will be as big as oblivion
[01:41] <soakrates_GGPO> it's all about the gauss rifle
[01:41] <OrinX> they told me if i voice u i get pernabanned
[01:41] <Shuri> this is what stalker so wanted to be
[01:41] <Shuri> but failed horribly
[01:42] <OrinX> j/k
[01:42] <syllogism> it looks like fallout 2 shotgun
[01:42] <syllogism> it didnt move either
[01:42] <OrinX> but thats what would happen :(
[01:42] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> ....
[01:42] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> no it wouldn't
[01:42] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> :(
[01:42] <soakrates_GGPO> syllogism: I dunno if that's a fair comparison, heh
[01:42] <syllogism> EVERYTHING MUST BE EXACTLY LIKE in FALLOUT 2
[01:42] <syllogism> edit: FALLOUT 1
[01:42] <Jideo> fallout 3 looks :( 
[01:42] <syllogism> fallout 2 isnt canon
[01:42] <OrinX> dude, wasabis finger is on the left mouse button over the ban kick option
[01:42] <soakrates_GGPO> haha

[01:47] <MrPing1000> was nintendo 2003 the one with the electroplankton dj?
[01:47] <Rorschach> Peter saves it
[01:47] <soakrates_GGPO> lol @ the Wiimote attachment
[01:47] <soakrates_GGPO> classic Nintendo
[01:47] <soakrates_GGPO> make a product you know isn't as good as it could be
[01:47] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> no it was the one with pac-man vs
[01:47] <Rorschach> I haven't seen the wiimote attatchment
[01:47] <atomsk> this choppy feed makes peter look like he's had about 20 red bulls
[01:47] <MaddenNFL64> Yea, Avatars, Home, Singstar. It's a shok that there was no Xmote. Everything felt like it was leading up to it. Course they had to go and awesome their show up at the end.
[01:47] <MrPing1000> i think electroplankton was at it as well gaime
[01:47] <soakrates_GGPO> then release another version of it or an add-on to milk your userbase for more money
[01:47] <Rorschach> what does it do?
[01:48] <Oldschoolgamer> " NBA Live 09 with fundementally shift sport gaming with "dynamic DNA"" <--- Lawl
[01:48] <Oldschoolgamer> all I have to say
[01:48] <MrPing1000> but yeah I agree nintendo 2003 was terrible
[01:48] <soakrates_GGPO> "Nintendo describes it, can more quickly and accurately reflect motions in a 3-D space."
[01:48] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> was electroplankton that long ago?
[01:48] <MrPing1000> i'll go check
[01:48] <Rorschach> oh shit dm

[01:49] <Jideo> Nintendo is all about the gamers
[01:49] <MrPing1000> so yes we can agree nintendo 2003 conference was incredibly awful

[01:50] <soakrates_GGPO> and then a sensible person asks -- "uh, why don't they just make a better Wii-mote and release that?"
[01:50] <Dan_THUGGla> Change Daily...right...
[01:50] <sp0rsk> because theres no reason to release a whole new controller
[01:50] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> why don't they do both
[01:50] <BJ> nsfw http://www.myfreecams.com/#SirenSong
[01:50] <MaddenNFL64> but then id have to buy a new wiimote charger. think of us darnit.
[01:50] <MrPing1000> a new controller would be stupid
[01:50] <jakehk> jide the stadiums in fifa09 look ridiculous
[01:50] <Dan_THUGGla> it'll be 2 weeks late 
[01:50] <Shuri> nintendo will redefine gaming as we know it
[01:50] <soakrates_GGPO> sp0rsk: yeah, unless you're a new Wii owner
[01:50] <sp0rsk> when they can just add a cheaper add on, and pack it in with a game
[01:50] <Shuri> just as they did with the original wiimote
[01:50] <Shuri> as you noticed, things changed in the industry
[01:50] <sp0rsk> who knows, it might be a pack in!
[01:51] <soakrates_GGPO> knowing Nintendo....
[01:51] <Dan_THUGGla> wtf Walton
[01:51] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> It's going to be packed in with SOMETHING
[01:51] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> even if it's Wii Blades
[01:51] <Dan_THUGGla> dagggerrrrr
[01:51] <MaddenNFL64> Actually, I would hope they have this neww whatever it is built in to the wiimotes from now on.
[01:51] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> a weapons combat tech demo
[01:51] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> Madden: that's what I'm saying

[02:08] <atomsk> ea mobile
[02:08] <Rorschach> Halo 7
[02:08] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> Bungie bought EA
[02:08] <EviLore> heh, seems the ffxiii multiplat announcement has caused less of a reaction than the DMC4 one did back in the day.  guess ps3 fans are more used to it by now

[02:08] * Firestorm has joined #GA
[02:08] <Oldschoolgamer> commenting on achievements...really?
[02:08] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> EviLore:  people have been kind of expecting it for the last year
[02:08] <charlequin> EviLore: I think that's probably accurate
[02:09] <Rorschach> EviLore: the big ps3 fanboys were banned already :\
[02:09] <MaddenNFL64> Super Space Warrior 1 from Bungie. Published by EA.
[02:09] <Oldschoolgamer> Wtf are going to say, "mighty fine job on playing through the intro. You and ten thousand others got the same thing"
[02:09] <Oldschoolgamer> :|
[02:09] <MrPing1000> why the hell are g4 the only place showing the ea conference stuttering crap :/
[02:09] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> I don't understand achievements
[02:10] <atomsk> you increase your e-penis. what is not to understand?
[02:10] <Oldschoolgamer> where is the crysis shit at >:(
[02:10] <MaddenNFL64> Their own achievements. Not XBL. So you have to earn then twice... I think.
[02:10] <charlequin> Oldschoolgamer: SOCIAL COMMUNITY FOO
[02:10] <charlequin> VELOCITY GIRL
[02:10] <charlequin> ET CETERA
[02:10] <MrPing1000> achievements are the worst thing to happen to games

[02:10] <Rorschach> that guy had no pizzazz
[02:10] <Rorschach> boring like these games
[02:10] <Ed> tetris with a draw feature?
[02:11] <Shuri> lol japanese devs lol
[02:11] <MaddenNFL64> He's all "show the reel, and buy our shit". Cool guy.
[02:11] * bluemax_work has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)

[02:11] <atomsk> BIOWARE
[02:11] <Rorschach> oh shit
[02:11] <Rorschach> here it comes
[02:11] <Ed> Spore Orgins, is that basically the spore bacteria part of the game?
[02:11] <Rorschach> are they gonna say what's exclusive to ps3?
[02:11] <MaddenNFL64> BIOWARE
[02:11] <Rorschach> oh snapz
[02:11] <Oldschoolgamer> Bioware is up!
[02:11] <Rorschach> dragon age
[02:11] <MrPing1000> capcom the only japanese dev impressing me and thats basically because they purposely looked at western games to learn how to make them
[02:11] <syllogism> where
[02:12] <syllogism> link
[02:12] <Oldschoolgamer> "They're showing off Dragon Age Origins"
[02:12] <OrinX> Madden Roster update 2010
[02:12] <Oldschoolgamer> fucking g4
[02:12] <Oldschoolgamer> :/
[02:12] <MaddenNFL64> Is this a sequel to Baldurs gate?
[02:12] <MrPing1000> that dude should lose the beard
[02:12] <Rorschach> Orin's Japanophile adventure $10
[02:12] <EviLore> g4 feed still unwatchable?
[02:12] <atomsk> "spiritual sequel"
[02:12] <MrPing1000> pretty much evil
[02:12] <MrPing1000> ore
[02:12] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> at best, achievements are a useless feature that involves developers giving you challenges that  hardcore gamers often already give themselves  (ie:  "beat the game on very hard")
[02:12] <MaddenNFL64> nah its decent for me atm.
[02:12] <Rorschach> not for me
[02:12] <MrPing1000> how can ore be evil?
[02:12] <Rorschach> guess it depends on when you brought it up
[02:12] <EviLore> what's the link again?
[02:13] <DMczaf> Now they're showing how your Sim really lives in the community with all the other Sims, which you would know already if you read the last issue of Games for Windows: The Official Magazine, cuz we had that stuff in the issue.  But of course you didn't buy it, which is why the mag no longer exists, which is why I am sitting here live blogging. Thanks assholes.

[02:13] <atomsk> trailer... same one?
[02:13] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> at worst they ruin gameplay and multiplayer experiences  (see:   TF2 and other games with online achievements)
[02:13] <MrPing1000> EviLore how can ore be evil?
[02:13] <EviLore> thx
[02:13] <Shuri> lol tf2 
[02:13] <Rorschach> bioware has sucked for years, but I'm hopeful :(

[02:13] <pj> dyack is going to be on g4 later
[02:13] * Oldschoolgamer slaps Gaime-NinjaWarrior around a bit with a large trout

[02:13] <EviLore> hope he mentions neogaf
[02:13] <Lo-Volt> TV or web?
[02:13] * Oldschoolgamer slaps Gaime-NinjaWarrior around a bit with a large trout
[02:14] * Gaime-NinjaWarrior revokes OSG's trout license
[02:14] <Oldschoolgamer> Tf2 hasn't been ruined by anything
[02:14] <Dan_THUGGla> you ruined it
[02:14] <Rorschach> Mass Effect was average at best
[02:14] <pj> tv, Lo-Volt 
[02:14] <Rorschach> not worthy
[02:14] <Shuri> you bring shame, Rorschach. 
[02:14] <Lo-Volt> Cool.
[02:14] <Rorschach> you bring shame to your face
[02:14] <Shuri> no u
[02:14] <Shuri> owned.
[02:14] <Rorschach> nothing but cg :\
[02:14] <MrPing1000> tf2 has gotten all lazy, instead of adding all these new things they should have just tweaked the basic weapons and classes to balance it. For example pyro, givem 50 more hp, and more damage from behind instead of unlockable stuff that you need to get your class to be balanced
[02:14] <Lo-Volt> Just in time to see G4 promote a show called Hurl!
[02:14] <MaddenNFL64> So, is it a RTS?
[02:14] <Rorschach> still...HOPEFUL

[02:31] * Amir0x has quit IRC (Quit: )
[02:31] <mac> Oh well, I still haven't played Neverwinter Nights 2
[02:31] <Dan_THUGGla> the damage control on the ps3 boards was funny
[02:31] <Darkh23> "anyways, i'm still happy with my PS3 (uncharted, MGS4 , etc) is FF even that hot of a seller anymore?"  =D
[02:32] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> Dark:    throwing FF under the bus
[02:32] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> how sad

[02:32] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> Mother three
[02:33] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> believe D:
[02:33] <EviLore> yesterday, sony's biggest (...and, well, nearly only) upcoming third party exclusive.  today, some largely irrelevant jrpg wankathon that no one really cared about to begin with
[02:33] <Darkh23> lol
[02:34] <Darkh23> yes now white knight story is better....who cares about FF13
[02:34] <Acosta> so will Rage be published by EA?
[02:34] <EviLore> yes
[02:35] <Rorschach> well, on the other side of that, there were the "ff sucks anyway and we get SO3" posts turned into "lol awesome can't wait to install it into my HDD!"
[02:35] <Sea_Manky> yesterday, sony's biggest (...and, well, nearly only) upcoming third party largely irrelevant jrpg wankathon
[02:35] <OrinX> yesterday, sony's biggest (...and, well, nearly only) upcoming third party exclusive.  today, some largely irrelevant jrpg wankathon that no one really cared about to begin with
[02:35] <OrinX> darkcloud?
[02:35] <Dan_THUGGla> i don't get the FF news anyway
[02:35] <Yann> white knight is still a big unknow quality wise considering rogue galaxy
[02:35] <Darkh23> eh it was more liek "FF13...lolz...2010....we gots all the jrpgs!!"
[02:35] <Dan_THUGGla> FF12 is already on 360
[02:36] <EGM92> Wait, Sony gets shit for having HDD installs but when MS does it, no one says shit?
[02:36] * MrPing1000 misses the days of games being made properly on the pc and consoles getting the watered down version

[02:37] <Ed> Silent Hill Homecoming?
[02:37] <Darkh23> egm...it's just an option on the 360 if you want to do it....at least it sounds like it....not like you're gonna fit more than 2 games on a 20GB 360 anyway...lolz
[02:37] <Dan_THUGGla> i'm surprised no one mentioned the real shock today....sega took down the PSU servers.
[02:37] <OrinX> Not even skies II?

[02:40] <EGM92> I REALLLY want Sony to have KojiPro at their conference with some ZOE3, that would sooth any pain that for losing FF13 lol
[02:40] <Shuri> but then again metroid2 and zelda2 are my fav games of each series :(
[02:40] <Lo-Volt> Is there video of Microsoft's conference?
[02:40] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> they didn't lose it though
[02:40] <MrPing1000> I'm not anti-nintendo, I don't really like metal gear solid, halo or gears of war either

[02:41] <Lo-Volt> FUCK YES!
[02:41] <EGM92> Gaime you wouldn't know what that's like
[02:41] <DMczaf> New Gameplay Mode “Hero”
[02:41] <DMczaf> This is a team-based game mode in which one member of each team is randomly selected to be their team’s Epic Hero. Players score points for their team by killing the enemy Hero or by killing enemies while they’re the Hero. The team that reaches the score limit first (or has the most points when time runs out) wins the game.

[02:56] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> Wow
[02:56] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> I didn't notice, but uh,   Nintendo kind of put nudity in Yoshi's Island
[02:56] <ZombieSupaStar> seeing people excited about fallout 3 that didnt play 1 or 2 makes me sad
[02:56] <ZombieSupaStar> tho
[02:56] <mac> ooh, FAllout 3 gameplay vid up
[02:57] <ZombieSupaStar> the trailer looks better than the gameplay
[02:57] <ZombieSupaStar> if its the same gameplay from yesterday
[02:57] <EviLore> people going "SCREW THE NMA IDIOTS" without having played fallout 1 and 2 should be bannable
[02:57] <Acosta> NMA will hate it no ,matter what
[02:57] <Acosta> no point checking
[02:57] <ZombieSupaStar> make it bannable evilore
[02:57] <ZombieSupaStar> make it!

[02:58] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> NSFW, obviously
[02:58] <ZombieSupaStar> itll be like gta 3
[02:58] <ZombieSupaStar> except of course the previous gtas would be better than gta 3 in this case
[02:59] <MrPing1000> I'll be day1 with fallout 3, I don't expect it to give me that warm fallout feeling but I'd imagine it'll have some quality to it
[02:59] <soakrates_GGPO> same
[02:59] <ZombieSupaStar> yeah mrping
[02:59] <soakrates_GGPO> well, I'm still in a "wait and see" stage
[02:59] <ZombieSupaStar> as long as it doesnt suck like oblivion did
[03:00] <Acosta> I'm going to take Fallout 3 as a game for itself
[03:00] <MrPing1000> but I'll be waiting for a mod to allow me to murder children
[03:00] <ZombieSupaStar> and if you didnt think oblivion sucked
[03:00] <mac> yeah
[03:00] <soakrates_GGPO> I have faith
[03:00] <Acosta> not thinking about the other two
[03:00] <mac> I think waiting for mods is sensible
[03:00] <ZombieSupaStar> then answer my there is no point in leveling up in oblivion
[03:00] <ZombieSupaStar> and how that somehow makes oblivion goty?
[03:00] <Acosta> that is always a valid option
[03:00] <soakrates_GGPO> I liked Oblivion but it didn't blow me away
[03:00] <ZombieSupaStar> im gonna do why oblivion sucks in paint
[03:00] <Tiduzlaptop> what happened to the return of abes oddyssey studio?
[03:00] <ZombieSupaStar> brb
[03:00] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> leveling up isn't as huge of a deal in WRPGs as it is in JRPGs
[03:01] <sp0rsk> I'm loving it, but then again I probably knew what I was getting into far more than the average GAFer. The combat is compelling, the story even at this early stage is quite nuanced and well-written (save for some of the generic trooper lines, but since those contrast so much with the more 'serious' dialogue in tone I think they should be taken quite obviously as tongue-in-cheek), the cutscenes are 
[03:01] <sp0rsk> well done--I enjoy the realist style with a slight veneer of flash, and the looting and skill setting is keeping me firmly glued to the game. 
[03:01] <sp0rsk> silicon knights viral marketer
[03:01] <sp0rsk> gotta be
[03:01] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> compare the ips with Dyack
[03:01] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> 's
[03:01] <Jideo> its not awful
[03:01] <sp0rsk> compelling combat for the win
[03:01] <Jideo> to be fair 
[03:01] <sp0rsk> its awful
[03:01] <sp0rsk> stop setting the bar so damn low
[03:01] <Acosta> I have the terrible feeling
[03:01] <pj> the story is terrible
[03:02] <pj> it goes everywhere and nowhere
[03:02] <Acosta> that the english version of FFXIII
[03:02] <Acosta> is going to take a while
[03:02] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> I think everyone, including Dyack, forgot why people cared about TH in the first place
[03:02] <Acosta> they say they will start the 360 conversion when they finish the ps3 one for Japan
[03:02] <sp0rsk> its like, the game gets announced, promises dmc like combat, fails hard, says its a diablo clone, seems to fail pretty hard at that too
[03:02] <Acosta> sonot only they have to localize it, they have to work in the port
[03:02] <DrForester> Gaime, why DID peopel care abotu TH int eh first place?
[03:02] <Jideo> yeah i didn't know 
[03:02] <sp0rsk> well silicon knights games usually ahve great stories and dialogue, NOPE!
[03:03] <Jideo> that they were going for dmc like combat 
[03:03] <ALinktotheSnitch> So, how is TOo Human?
[03:03] <Jideo> even when i told my friend i said it'd be sick if they had dmc like combat 
[03:03] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> well
[03:03] <sp0rsk> the skill tree in the demo is sooooooooooooooooooooo bad
[03:03] <Jideo> but its so clunky 
[03:03] <MrPing1000> I'd rather play a game where I AM Dyack
[03:03] <Jideo> and right stick to attack???
[03:03] <Jideo> :S
[03:03] <ALinktotheSnitch> So when does Too Human come out?
[03:03] <sp0rsk> the menu system is clunky, the fonts make it look like a home made live arcade game
[03:03] <MrPing1000> Too soon

[03:07] <Gaime-NinjaWarrior> the BIG part about TH was the integration of gameplay, character, and story.   You were supposed to:   #1:   Be able to customize each body part of your character.     #2:   Each choice you made about your body customization affeted the combat AND gameplay style  (you could be stealthy with certain body modifications, or skip over certain portions of levels, thins like that.).   Basically,  your choices for character customization affected combat and out-of-com

[03:08] <minty> and the fact that everyone looked so alike didn't help but hell i liked the battle system

[03:09] <charlequin> yes
[03:09] <ALinktotheSnitch> Ah
[03:09] <DrForester> FFXII's story seemed alot more coherant than most FF games, it jsut didn't seem there was that much to it
[03:09] <ALinktotheSnitch> So that's why it looks so much like Space Invaders Extreme and Pac-Man Championship Edition.

[03:14] <Acosta> yes Zombie
[03:14] <ALinktotheSnitch> EGM: Yes
[03:14] <ZombieSupaStar> lies
[03:14] <ALinktotheSnitch> I think so, anyway.
[03:14] <minty> 10%
[03:15] <Acosta> I think so, but after the merger with Enis is not as meaningful as before
[03:15] <ALinktotheSnitch> Yeah, they owned 19%, but it dropped to 10% when Square and Enix merged.
[03:15] <EGM92> sony is a 10% share holder for Square?

[03:22] <EviLore> The Transformers star reckons it would be a hit if it were done tastefully.
[03:22] <EviLore> 'I would love to do a movie naked,' she tells the Daily Star Sunday. 'No one dares to make that kind of film today.
[03:22] <EviLore> 'They did it in the 1930s in an arty way, so why not now?'
[03:22] <Acosta> maybe this?
[03:22] <Dan_THUGGla> 2 down
[03:22] <DMczaf> SOMEONE LET MEGAN FOX BE NAKED
[03:22] <EviLore> someone notify mike works
[03:22] <Gattsu25> I'm still pissed that they announced DA moving to the consoles before the game even fucking shipped (and I know it's not clear if they mean *this* DA, but still)

[04:05] <jman2050> so we don't get overrun by fags
[04:05] <Tiduzlaptop> is that there will be no console specific optimizations

[04:08] <TheDarkShinobi> ah, how the tides have turned
[04:08] <CajoleJuice> were you close with them
[04:08] <Lo-Volt> With the first one, no.
[04:08] <TheDarkShinobi> fifa 09 ftw
[04:08] <Lo-Volt> The second was close enough to my mother and I to be godfather.
[04:08] <TheDarkShinobi> game of the century
[04:08] <jakehk> true
[04:08] <TheDarkShinobi> everyone else can give up
[04:08] * CK- has joined #GA
[04:08] <Lo-Volt> He was a bodybuilder, too, so the physical change was tremendous.
[04:08] <CajoleJuice> jeez
[04:08] <CajoleJuice> yae cancer is awful :\
[04:09] <CK-> hello cajole
[04:09] <Lo-Volt> He could flex as a retiree, I swear, but he lost all his mass and had a big belly because of what happened.
[04:09] <CajoleJuice> hey CK
[04:09] <Dan_THUGGla> where your tickets for the event tonight?
[04:09] <CajoleJuice> how about joe morgan picking utley to win
[04:09] <Lo-Volt> Things will be fine, though.
[04:09] <CajoleJuice> because he's a "line-drive hitter"
[04:09] <CajoleJuice> bahah
[04:09] <CK-> did not get tickets for tonight
[04:09] <CK-> friend
[04:09] <Dan_THUGGla> Uggla is too awesome for your eyes
[04:10] <CajoleJuice> well, i hope you can get stuff together soon, lo-volt
[04:10] <CajoleJuice> :)
[04:10] <Lo-Volt> Sure.
[04:10] <Y2Kev> thuggla
[04:10] <TheDarkShinobi> how about joe morgan shutting the fuck up?
[04:10] <Lo-Volt> I'm just taking it day by day. I'll bail out sooner or later.
[04:10] <Lo-Volt> Preferably sooner, but I'm not fussing tonight.
[04:10] <Lo-Volt> For a change. :D
[04:11] <CajoleJuice> that's good
[04:11] <TheDarkShinobi> unlike sony fans lolz
[04:11] <CajoleJuice> shin: not gonna happen, unfortunately
[04:11] <Unison> lol @ 49 page FFXIII thread
[04:11] <Lo-Volt> LOL Shinobi.
[04:11] * Unison hi-5 shin
[04:11] <TheDarkShinobi> LOL
[04:11] <Lo-Volt> Nice.
[04:11] <Unison> our trolling paid off
[04:11] <CajoleJuice> i havent really checked anything
[04:11] <CajoleJuice> but i did hear about FFXIII
[04:11] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> what's bigger?!  5/8, 3/4, or 7/8 ?!
[04:11] <TheDarkShinobi> xbots suddenly giving a shit about the game
[04:11] <Unison> we've corrupted the mindshare enough that Square lost faith in Sony
[04:11] <CajoleJuice> hahahaha
[04:11] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> i DON'T KNOW NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[04:11] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> </Joe>
[04:11] <Dan_THUGGla> crap
[04:11] <Lo-Volt> Full installs is more interesting to me.
[04:12] <TheDarkShinobi> sony fans looking for square-enix voodoo dolls
[04:12] <Lo-Volt> If only that were a launch feature.
[04:12] <Unison> 360 CLEARLY the RPG system of choice now
[04:12] <Unison> lol lol
[04:12] <Unison> remember that thread where all the PS3 fans were like
[04:12] <Dan_THUGGla> Uggla is 4th :|
[04:12] <CajoleJuice> maybe i'll play dead rising
[04:12] <Unison> "well, we have the only RPG that matters"
[04:12] <Lo-Volt> The PS3 didn't even get ETERNAL FUCKING SONATA yet.
[04:12] <Unison> lol lol
[04:12] <CajoleJuice> if i can install all of it
[04:12] <Lo-Volt> Seriously.
[04:12] <Lo-Volt> LOL.
[04:12] <TheDarkShinobi> this move, like every other former sony exclusive hitting 360 (or ds in dq9's case lolz), was predictable years ago
[04:12] <soakrates> fuck Final Fantasy
[04:12] <Unison> truth
[04:12] <Lo-Volt> I don't know if the function is retroactive?
[04:12] <Unison> MGS4 Konami... do it now
[04:12] <CajoleJuice> i think it is, lo-volt
[04:12] <Unison> haha
[04:12] <soakrates> this news didn't surprise me at all, honestly
[04:12] <Lo-Volt> It IS?
[04:12] <Lo-Volt> Damn.
[04:13] <Lo-Volt> That's megaton.
[04:13] <CajoleJuice> don't hold me to that
[04:13] <Diablos> bwahahaha
[04:13] <TheDarkShinobi> mgs4 will get a year on ps3 all to itself
[04:13] <CajoleJuice> :P
[04:13] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Kofi and Mickie
[04:13] <soakrates> in fact, I was more surprised when I found t it wasn't already confirmed
[04:13] <Diablos> i still can't get over this megaton
[04:13] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Rawr
[04:13] <TheDarkShinobi> then hit 360
[04:13] <Diablos> ff13 on 360
[04:13] <Diablos> lol
[04:13] <TheDarkShinobi> kojima is really the last true sony stalwart
[04:13] <Lo-Volt> The way the conference did it was awesome, though.
[04:13] <Unison> and Shane Bettenhausen
[04:13] <Diablos> TheDarkShinobi: And then when MGS4 comes to 360 on 6 discs
[04:13] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[04:13] <Unison> who was trolling the Square Enix conference
[04:13] <Lo-Volt> "Thank you for coming! "OH WAIT SON."
[04:13] <Diablos> he will officially have jumped ship too
[04:13] <Lo-Volt> Crowd: " :O "
[04:13] <Lo-Volt> Don: :)
[04:13] <Diablos> if you think about it
[04:13] <Unison> <Shane> Excuse me, can you clarify... will Final Fantasy be coming to Xbox... IN JAPAN!??!?!
[04:13] <Unison> lol
[04:14] <Diablos> MGS4 COULD be on 360 with some watered down textures perhaps
[04:14] <Unison> what a loser
[04:14] <Diablos> think about how every act has to be installed
[04:14] <TheDarkShinobi> haha, it won't take more then two discs
[04:14] <Lo-Volt> 1UP Yours up?
[04:14] <Diablos> you could just swap discs instead
[04:14] <Darkh23> lol shane QQ
[04:14] <Lo-Volt> Three 1UP Yours casts this week?
[04:14] <TheDarkShinobi> watered down textures? they're not watered down already?
[04:14] <Lo-Volt> THAT'S megaton./
[04:14] <Unison> Sony team just had a meeting
[04:14] <Diablos> TheDarkShinobi: The textures in MGS4 are actually nice
[04:14] <Unison> the new official battle cry is now:
[04:14] <Unison> WAIT FOR FFXIII VERSUS
[04:14] <soakrates> man
[04:14] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Wait for Home
[04:14] <Lo-Volt> No it isn't.
[04:14] <Unison> lol
[04:14] <Lo-Volt> It's RETREAT!
[04:14] <Dan_THUGGla> Raw tonight is 1 continuous segment.

[04:15] <TheDarkShinobi> of course, ps3's still gonna be #1 at the end of this gen
[04:15] <soakrates> does Japan really matter that much anymore?
[04:15] <TheDarkShinobi> so what that it's lost almost every worthwhile exclusive to the competition
[04:15] <Diablos> Wait for home = new "wait for spaceworld"
[04:15] <soakrates> serious question
[04:15] <Nikashi> I heard rumblings of Final Fantasy 360 
[04:15] <soakrates> I think Xbox1 and 360 pretty much prove that it doesn't
[04:15] <Nikashi> anyone care to elaborate?
[04:15] <TheDarkShinobi> man, that e3 room's chat log must be fire
[04:15] <TheDarkShinobi> when that announcement got dropped

[04:16] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Nikashi
[04:16] <soakrates> Nikashi: there is a SLIGHT chance that FFXIII will come to 360
[04:16] <soakrates> SLIGHT
[04:16] <TheDarkShinobi> created for the others to inhibit

[04:26] <Y2Kev> G4!!
[04:26] <TToB> How many versions of FF13 and how many versions of FF7? :P
[04:26] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> unison: i think that's a guarantee
[04:26] <Tiduzlaptop> PC version of ff13 will look amazing
[04:26] <Tiduzlaptop> lol
[04:26] <Tiduzlaptop> MIRRORS EDGE
[04:26] <Tiduzlaptop> now that looks AWESOME
[04:26] <Unison> mirror's edge looks bad
[04:26] <Unison> imo
[04:26] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> no you.
[04:26] <Unison> i dont trust that game at all
[04:26] <Tiduzlaptop> really? i disagree
[04:26] <Unison> it's a 1st person platformer by EA
[04:26] <Tiduzlaptop> :p
[04:27] <Unison> use some common sense
[04:27] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> someone wake Scarlet up
[04:27] <Tiduzlaptop> it looks awesome to me
[04:27] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> mirror's edge looks really good.
[04:27] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> emphasis on looks
[04:27] <TToB> Mirror's Edge, or as I prefer Jumping Gash.
[04:27] <Dan_THUGGla> where is punk?
[04:27] <Tiduzlaptop> I havent seen enough gameplay yet
[04:27] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> i'll have to try it out before i decide on buying it
[04:27] <Tiduzlaptop> so i wont judge it yet
[04:27] <Tiduzlaptop> Also
[04:27] <Unison> Jumping Gash LOL
[04:27] <Tiduzlaptop> i bet
[04:27] <Tiduzlaptop> tekken 6 will go to 360 as well.
[04:27] <Tiduzlaptop> scamco
[04:27] <TheDarkShinobi> LOL @ "I trusted square"

[04:27] <TheDarkShinobi> once again sony bots continue to miss the point
[04:28] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Two questions
[04:28] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> http://www.gametrailers.com/player/36281.html this really looks pretty incredible
[04:28] <TheDarkShinobi> third parties are in business for themselves
[04:28] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> #1:  What should I expect
[04:28] <Tiduzlaptop> square needs money
[04:28] <TheDarkShinobi> not for sony
[04:28] <Tiduzlaptop> now theyll get it
[04:28] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> #2:  Any advice?
[04:28] <TheDarkShinobi> not for ps3 owners
[04:28] <Dan_THUGGla> OH SHIT

[04:28] <jman2050> did hamilton
[04:28] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> gaime: expect seriously old-school rpg gameplay, and insanely dated graphics
[04:28] <jman2050> just hit that?
[04:28] <TToB> The only thing I care about from Square is Super Galdelic Hour 2 on PS3 :D
[04:28] <Unison> #3 the story is quite aweasome
[04:28] <TheDarkShinobi> but for their shareholders, the big boss, and anyone else who's got actual MONEY invested in 'em
[04:28] <jman2050> did he seriously just hit that?
[04:28] <CajoleJuice> JOSH HAMILTON IS A BEAST
[04:28] <Tiduzlaptop> TheDarkShinobi altho
[04:28] <CK-> NO WAAAAY
[04:28] <jman2050> oh my god
[04:28] <Tiduzlaptop> i wonder
[04:28] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> if you like draogn quest, you'll love dq7
[04:28] <Unison> i think the graphics are fine
[04:28] <Tiduzlaptop> if ff13 flops on 360
[04:28] <CajoleJuice> HOLY SHIT
[04:28] <Unison> the animation is great
[04:28] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> CK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[04:28] <Tiduzlaptop> MS must have paid MILLIONS for that
[04:28] <Tiduzlaptop> lol
[04:28] <Dan_THUGGla> Uggla > Hamilton 
[04:28] <TToB> Holy shit! E3 resurrected CK!

[04:29] <priz> I miss ck
[04:29] <Unison> gaime, the load times are so short
[04:29] <Unison> compared to any other disc based RPG
[04:29] <minty> oh yesh unison!
[04:29] <priz> he was cool to hang out with
[04:29] <Unison> which is amazing
[04:29] <minty> virtual fighter 5 was such a sucess! with onrine!
[04:29] <Unison> it was okay for xbots to let that flop
[04:29] <Nikashi> Tiduz: More like "Sony must have really fucked up"
[04:29] <priz> TToB: Super Galdelic Hour 2? sweet!
[04:29] <Unison> it already flopped on PS3
[04:29] <Unison> they had nothing to prove
[04:29] <priz> domestic release? pleasepleaseplease
[04:29] <Tiduzlaptop> Nikashi, sony is just retarded for not securing exclusives
[04:29] <TToB> Xbots are just punchy because after 7 years of wishing, they're finalyy getting a port of FF. :P
[04:30] <jman2050> Josh Hamilton
[04:30] <jman2050> is a beast
[04:30] <minty> it flooped even harder on 360 despite having online plus better gfx
[04:30] <Unison> well, they got FFXI
[04:30] <Tiduzlaptop> If i was sony id buy capcom.
[04:30] <Tiduzlaptop> CAPCOM OWNS THIS GEN.
[04:30] * BJ-Derby is now known as BJ-502FEETBIATCH
[04:30] <Unison> it flopped because sega put it out
[04:30] <minty> no Tiduz
[04:30] <Unison> and sega = flop
[04:30] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> no Tiduz
[04:30] <minty> buy square!
[04:30] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> D:
[04:30] <Tiduzlaptop> lulz square
[04:30] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> BUY NINTENDO!
[04:30] <TheDarkShinobi> yeah, since when does software flop on 360?
[04:30] <CK-> I think Hamilton is still on drugs
[04:30] <jman2050> Jos HAMILTON
[04:30] <Tiduzlaptop> i dunno about that
[04:30] <jman2050> hamilton lol
[04:30] <TToB> if I were sony I'd go third party
[04:30] <CK-> performance enhancers
[04:30] <TToB> Wiihawk!
[04:30] <Tiduzlaptop> or buy KH3.
[04:30] <minty> no wai
[04:30] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> I see an 8 bit cena shirt
[04:30] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> O_o
[04:30] <jman2050> WTF
[04:31] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> mirrors edge is like the best looking next gen game for me
[04:31] <Unison> KH3 is gonna be on Wii tomorrow, i bet 
[04:31] <Tiduzlaptop> Warhawk 1.4 ftw btw
[04:31] <minty> wii would only be able to render one warhawk
[04:31] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> at 1 FPS
[04:31] <Unison> which will be part two of the PS3 bloodbath
[04:31] <Tiduzlaptop> lol minty
[04:31] <Nikashi> minty: But WAGGLE
[04:31] <Unison> haha
[04:31] <Tiduzlaptop> Unison really hates ps3

[04:31] <Tiduzlaptop> haha
[04:31] <Unison> and sony's have the most to lose
[04:31] <minty> who won't buy anything sony
[04:32] <TheDarkShinobi> sony fans on the other hand are a bunch of frontrunning frauds
[04:32] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> gaime: the team is stretched out right now
[04:32] <Tiduzlaptop> I like all 3, altho i must admit im a bit sony biased

[04:32] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> I get the feelings we're going to see some big shit from nintendo tomorrow
[04:32] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> between the psp game, ff13, ff13vs, and ff7ac complete
[04:32] <Tiduzlaptop> But im not a raving suicidal fanboy.
[04:32] <Dan_THUGGla> Uggla is officially out :|
[04:32] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> gaime: I'd expect the usual from nintendo if i were you
[04:32] <minty> ff6 hd remake! making it happen s-e
[04:32] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> pure, unadultered garbage
[04:32] <Unison> this just makes it so much easier for Dreamcast 2
[04:32] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> but it's an even year!
[04:32] <Unison> to storm in and sweep up
[04:32] <TToB> Unison: If by fine you mean "has no games" then you are correct. :P

[04:33] <Unison> "Final Fantasy is so last gen!"
[04:33] <Tiduzlaptop> then translation starts
[04:33] <Tiduzlaptop> which will take 5 years.
[04:33] <Darkh23> I'm sure they'll show GoW3 tomorrow and then it'll be YEAR OF THE PS3 again
[04:33] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> John Cena hates America

[04:34] <jman2050> Josh Hamilton
[04:34] <Tiduzlaptop> such drama.
[04:34] <jman2050> this is retarded
[04:34] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> every year is year of the ps3
[04:34] <Unison> whatever sony has
[04:34] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> reminds me of the gamecube daze
[04:34] <Unison> they better fucking show it

[04:34] <Unison> hahahaha
[04:34] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> and just like before, i'm stuck with the losing console this gen
[04:34] <Nikashi> Guys

[04:34] <Nikashi> don't worry
[04:34] <soakrates> GoW3?

[04:35] <soakrates> that's gotta mean something else
[04:35] <Tiduzlaptop> Uncharted 2
[04:35] <Tiduzlaptop> they need to show.
[04:35] <Tiduzlaptop> or jak.
[04:35] <Nikashi> Geez
[04:35] <Nikashi> Now all 360 needs is a Dragon Quest
[04:35] <Unison> You're in the Movies was the worst thing i've ever seen at a press conference
[04:35] <Tiduzlaptop> lots of jak fanboys
[04:35] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Nik:   fat chance
[04:35] <Tiduzlaptop> Unison that made me lulz so hard
[04:35] <Tiduzlaptop> poor john
[04:35] <Nikashi> It has Final Fantasy, Tales,  Star Ocean
[04:35] <Tiduzlaptop> perfect gif material
[04:35] <Schwowsers> How unlikely is it that we'll see what Team Ico has been working on?
[04:35] <Nikashi> How many other RPG series are missing that are still active
[04:35] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> DQ will go to Wii if it goes to a console
[04:35] <TheDarkShinobi> well ds fucked sony up on the dq front
[04:35] * errorGAIDEN2 has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[04:35] <CK-> This is abreu status now
[04:35] <TheDarkShinobi> that's still the most embarassing exclusive loss
[04:35] <Unison> team ico's game will be shown
[04:35] <Unison> absolutely
[04:35] <TheDarkShinobi> losing out to a fucking 16 bit portable
[04:35] <Schwowsers> I hope so
[04:36] <Tiduzlaptop> imo ps3 isnt doomed
[04:36] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> 32
[04:36] <Tiduzlaptop> they are just 3th place

[04:37] <soakrates> FFXIII is still coming out on PS3 in the US right?
[04:37] <Diablos> MGS4 pretty much confirmed that a developer will only hurt itself by keeping a really huge anticipated game as a PS3 exclusive
[04:37] <Tiduzlaptop> Did marketplace get FFXIII hd trailer?
[04:37] <Tiduzlaptop> soakrates yes
[04:37] <soakrates> k

[05:56] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> PSThree
[05:56] <SuperSic> PStwo II
[05:57] <TheDarkShinobi> g4's showing the latter stages of the ms conference
[05:57] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> PSThree:  approximately the size of two PSPs aligned vertically
[05:57] <TheDarkShinobi> the crowd reaction to the f13 drop should be humourous
[05:57] <Vyse> so how long do you think Sony knew about this betrayalton? I like to think they sat there and watched it unfold with the rest of us lol
[05:57] * HadesGigas has joined #GA
[05:57] <Tony_Parker> hmm Flair at Smackdown
[05:57] <Diablos> people were cheering like someone won the superbowl
[05:58] <TheDarkShinobi> eh
[05:58] <TheDarkShinobi> this has been coming on for years
[05:58] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[05:58] <Diablos> before there were was barely golf clapping
[05:58] <minty> considering sony owns 10% of square, i'm sure they've knowing it for quite a while
[05:58] <Diablos> then after ff13 the place went crazy
[05:58] <TheDarkShinobi> I would've lol'd
[05:58] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> no minty
[05:58] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> they own like 4%
[05:58] <TheDarkShinobi> but there's nothing surprising about this
[05:58] <minty> only 4% now? sony keeps losing
[05:58] <Diablos> sony clearly has no money left
[05:58] <Mandoric> I wonder how long it'll last.  One way or the other.
[05:58] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> they owned 10% of Square and then Square and Enix merged
[05:58] <TheDarkShinobi> and I don't know how it'd be betrayal
[05:59] <minty> i thought it was 20% before the merger
[05:59] <Pimpwerx> it just makes financial sense
[05:59] <Mandoric> A lot of series were dualie for specific regions in the 32-bit era at the beginning, but that faded.
[05:59] <Diablos> sony betrayed developers by being cocky and overzealous... i'd argue they recovered from that by dropping the price and not acting so goddamn cocky (although tomorrow could prove us wrong), but it was too little too late
[05:59] <Nikashi> 360 = jRPG Box confirmed
[05:59] <Pimpwerx> the ps3 is tanking, especially in japan
[05:59] <Diablos> MS capitalized on the situation in north america
[05:59] <Diablos> and Sony could never catch up
[05:59] <TheDarkShinobi> it's little to do with that
[05:59] <TheDarkShinobi> it's about money
[05:59] <Tony_Parker> Is Cody trying to cover up his Zelda logo on his boot
[05:59] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Fuck I was expecting sony to drop the bomb and announce PS3 launch price at either $300 or $350
[05:59] * fortifiedc has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[05:59] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> not twice that amount
[06:00] <Diablos> eh I think if sony wasn't so damn cocky they would have been able to convince enough devs to stick around for a good while
[06:00] <M3wThr33> Hey all
[06:00] <TheDarkShinobi> you can't make 20 to 40 million dollar games and keep 'em on one console
[06:00] <Diablos> but they were like
[06:00] <WasabiKing> thrid parties really can't go exclusive anymore
[06:00] <Diablos> completely out of their minds
[06:00] <Diablos> in 2006
[06:00] <TheDarkShinobi> nevermind a console that's buried in third
[06:00] <Diablos> WasabiKing, yeah, today
[06:00] <M3wThr33> Tell that to Konami
[06:00] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Because they did the same shit with the PS2 as they did with the PS3 about hyping their system up as being really expensive and state of the art
[06:00] <Pimpwerx> the real problem is the ps3 sucks in japan
[06:00] <TheDarkShinobi> I said over three years ago, most of the ps2 third party exclusives would wind up on the next xbox
[06:00] <Pimpwerx> that's ff's stomping grounds
[06:00] <Diablos> Pimpwerx - uhh
[06:00] <WasabiKing> the amount spent on advertising along is recockulous
[06:00] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> and then they made the price point pretty affordable
[06:00] <Diablos> Xbox 360 doesn't even have 1 mil units in Japan sold
[06:00] <Nikashi> FXIII will come out in Japan as world collection
[06:00] <Pimpwerx> no way square is taking a header
[06:00] <Nikashi> lawl
[06:00] <TheDarkShinobi> the japanese market sucks
[06:01] <M3wThr33> 360 FF13 is not going to be in Japan
[06:01] <Pimpwerx> diablos: i know, but now sony can't claim japan as a firewall
[06:01] <Nikashi> M3wThr33: Yeah that's why I said world collection heh
[06:01] <WasabiKing> and the fact that they're willing to pay premium price is even more recockulous
[06:01] <M3wThr33> Japan, a little island, generates game sales equal to whole continents
[06:01] <Diablos> true, but there are still more ps3 gamers in japan
[06:01] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> neither the 360 nor the PS3 are doing well in japan
[06:01] <TheDarkShinobi> even if ps3 was hauling there, it wouldn't be enough
[06:01] <Mandoric> Define "wouldn't be enough"
[06:01] <Diablos> europe is sony's best shot honestly
[06:01] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> if Square Enix wanted to make FFXIII have a large userbase on all regions
[06:01] <TheDarkShinobi> the japanese market is a piece of shit compared to what it was a decade ago
[06:01] <WasabiKing> lol europe
[06:01] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> they'd have gone wii
[06:01] <Mandoric> For the US, no, but ignoring the US...
[06:01] <Pimpwerx> shin:  meh, i don't know.  it would be a different story is sony could at least muster an effort in their home turf
[06:01] <Diablos> ms has north america by the balls
[06:01] <SuperSic> PS3 is doing well for its pricepoint
[06:01] <Pimpwerx> but they're getting murdered there
[06:02] <ALinktotheSnitch> I hope for a DK Jr. sequel on WiiWare.
[06:02] <Tony_Parker> you can't see me
[06:02] <TheDarkShinobi> yeah, sony's got europe wrappedup like a mummy
[06:02] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> problem is they probably already spent a lot of resources on FFXIII HD by the time they realized the PS3 was bombing
[06:02] <WasabiKing> but euros have no taste
[06:02] <WasabiKing> and are shitty programmers
[06:02] <Diablos> lol
[06:02] <WasabiKing> they've been working on home for how long
[06:02] <TheDarkShinobi> that's beside the point
[06:02] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> so instnead of remaking assets for the Wii, they did the next best thing and made it multiplatform for PS3 and 360
[06:02] <TheDarkShinobi> and truth be told
[06:02] <TheDarkShinobi> nobody on this earth has taste
[06:02] <WasabiKing> and then you look at home
[06:02] <TheDarkShinobi> except me of course
[06:02] <Diablos> they should just ditch home at this point, shit
[06:02] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> At least that's what I'd guess
[06:02] <Tony_Parker> lol
[06:02] <WasabiKing> home on ms
[06:02] <Tony_Parker> he missed
[06:02] <Tony_Parker> stfu!
[06:02] <WasabiKing> they supposedly did that in a year
[06:02] <WasabiKing> lol
[06:03] <TheDarkShinobi> ps3 was just a bad play from the very beginning
[06:03] <WasabiKing> euros should not be programming
[06:03] <Tony_Parker> wtf
[06:03] <WasabiKing> lol
[06:03] <Pimpwerx> sony fucked themselves pretty good
[06:03] <Pimpwerx> oh well
[06:03] <Mandoric> I think there are two big questions with FF13.
[06:03] <Pimpwerx> just look at psn
[06:03] <Diablos> if sony wasn't dumb about PS3 launch and had an answer to xbox live out of the box, it would have helped them greatly
[06:03] <WasabiKing> or if it is crucial, time related info
[06:03] <Mandoric> How big of a delay the overseas version has and what the sales breakdown is.
[06:03] <WasabiKing> euros should not be involved
[06:03] <Pimpwerx> the combined ps1 and ps2 libraries murder VC and XBLA
[06:03] <WasabiKing> PERIOD
[06:03] <TheDarkShinobi> late to the party, sickingly overpriced, absurdly built, and barely outdoes the 360 if at all
[06:03] <Diablos> wasabi hating on the euros
[06:03] <Pimpwerx> but you can find more of those games on bittorrent than on psn
[06:03] <WasabiKing> it's not hate if it's the truth
[06:03] <Diablos> hahaha
[06:03] <TheDarkShinobi> then nintendo pretty much chopped sony off at the knees
[06:03] <Diablos> tony blair bought a ps3 for his kids
[06:03] <WhiteMan> Wasabi, it's the Australians we hate, not the euros
[06:03] <minty> and look what happend to him
[06:03] <WasabiKing> and if they want to get political, our people don't form human swastikas at sporting events
[06:04] <Diablos> minty heheh
[06:04] <jakehk> Czech Rep  2 - 0  England 
[06:04] <Nikashi> TheDarkShinobi: Now MS is kicking the legless torso in the balls
[06:04] <TheDarkShinobi> ms too in fairness, then again ms at least has software sales in it's corner
[06:04] <Tony_Parker> wtf
[06:04] <Diablos> wasabi haha yeah
[06:04] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[06:04] <WasabiKing> so that argument is won
[06:04] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> ambush scene time jobber
[06:04] <WasabiKing> stand down, almighty euros
[06:04] <TheDarkShinobi> fuck europe really
[06:04] <WasabiKing> with your shit for ethics
[06:04] <WasabiKing> lol
[06:04] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> time to be run over by a car
[06:04] <Nikashi> TheDarkShinobi: That's been Canada's opinion for a while now hehe
[06:04] <Nikashi> Europe = YAY CANAD
[06:04] <Nikashi> Canada = Fuck you, eh!
[06:04] <TheDarkShinobi> listen to a twit like sepp blatter
[06:04] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> BEHIND OU
[06:04] <TheDarkShinobi> he'd be hung by the balls if he talked like he does here
[06:05] <Pimpwerx> sony has one of the biggest movie and music divisions
[06:05] <Pimpwerx> but wtf is their music or movie store?
[06:05] <TheDarkShinobi> hehe
[06:05] <WasabiKing> I LOL at that dude's PR spin with the nazi hookers
[06:05] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> OTHER WAY
[06:05] <Pimpwerx> fucking live gets netflix
[06:05] <Tony_Parker> wtf @ Raw
[06:05] <TheDarkShinobi> sony's been all talk regarding online for years
[06:05] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> and now the truck explodes
[06:05] <Pimpwerx> seriously...why do people think stringer and hirai are so smart?
[06:05] <SuperSic> you still need a netflix subscription...
[06:05] <WasabiKing> suing for privacy violations, lol
[06:05] <TheDarkShinobi> they talked big with ps2, they did next to nothing
[06:06] <TheDarkShinobi> fucking dreamcast outdid ps2's shit
[06:06] * SnakeXs has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[06:06] <WasabiKing> the only ps2 game that was online that everyone played was Madden
[06:06] <TheDarkShinobi> they talked real big with ps3, we're still waiting
[06:06] <Pimpwerx> supersic:  the point is that it's still a step ahead of the media company, sony
[06:06] <Nikashi> PS3 hasn't even matched live feature for feature  yet
[06:06] <Mandoric> MS's software sales are slowing down a bit.  They used to outpace PS3 attach on big titles, now they're, well, not.  Still definitely have US mindshare locked up pretty hard, though.
[06:06] <Pimpwerx> dreamcast?  stfu, shin.
[06:06] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> wtf
[06:06] <ZombieSupaStar> ROFL
[06:06] <Tony_Parker> OMG
[06:06] <ZombieSupaStar> WTF IS THIS
[06:06] <Tony_Parker> CENA NOOOO
[06:06] <Diablos> FFXIII North America and Europe is going to be development hell
[06:06] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[06:06] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> CENA NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[06:06] <SuperSic> Well Stringer is supposedly trying to fix that by unifying sony's divisions
[06:06] <HadesGigas> Spoilers: Cena dies
[06:06] <Tony_Parker> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[06:06] <Tony_Parker> NOOOOOOOOOOO
[06:06] <ZombieSupaStar> JION XENA!
[06:06] <Diablos> S-E not even developing the 360 version until after the JP release
[06:06] <ZombieSupaStar> JION XENA!
[06:06] <ZombieSupaStar> JION XENA!
[06:06] <ZombieSupaStar> JION XENA!
[06:06] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> he wasn't there
[06:07] <minty> wtf
[06:07] <TheDarkShinobi> dude, dc was doing online games on narrowband 3 years before sony did anything at all
[06:07] <Nikashi> ZombieSupaStar: So are you into puroresu ?
[06:07] <WasabiKing> no cracka ass cracka is going to unite sony
[06:07] <WasabiKing> he's a joke within his own company
[06:07] <TheDarkShinobi> sony's just been a joke as far as online gaming goes
[06:07] <Diablos> i don't even think sony cared
[06:07] <Diablos> about online gaming
[06:07] <ZombieSupaStar> i dont really know much aboot it wasabni
[06:07] <TheDarkShinobi> ms has completely embarassed 'em, it's not even a fair fight
[06:07] * fortifiedc has joined #GA
[06:07] <minty> onrine? what!!
[06:07] <ZombieSupaStar> bi
[06:07] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> .... ok
[06:07] <Tony_Parker> ...
[06:07] <Nikashi> TheDarkShinobi: bu bu bu Free!
[06:07] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> WWE superstars suck at murder
[06:08] <minty> i don't care what sony does as long as warhawk online is working
[06:08] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> why is that, jobber
[06:08] * SnakeXs has joined #GA
[06:08] <TheDarkShinobi> lolz
[06:08] <WasabiKing> japanese can't do online
[06:08] <HadesGigas> Not Benoit
[06:08] <WasabiKing> period
[06:08] <TheDarkShinobi> YOU CAN JACK INTO THE MATRIX, LIKE COOL DOODS
[06:08] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> ouch hades
[06:08] <Diablos> they are definitely behind
[06:08] <Diablos> next-gen will be interesting
[06:08] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> XD
[06:08] <TheDarkShinobi> nothing but talk
[06:08] <WasabiKing> well, that's a classic case of engineers meet marketing people
[06:08] <Diablos> sony will probably have home right out of the box
[06:08] <Tony_Parker> I was expecting Punk to be by the Pepsi machine
[06:08] <Tony_Parker> :|
[06:08] * Pimpwerx has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.83 [Firefox 3.0/2008052906])
[06:08] <WasabiKing> all we do is take the boring technical shit and try to make it relatable
[06:08] <Nikashi> Tony_Parker: He should always have a coke in his hand or something
[06:08] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> what's nintendo oging to be doing
[06:09] <Diablos> waggle 2.0
[06:09] <WasabiKing> cause if you let engineers promote their own shit, it would NEVER sell
[06:09] <minty> waggle waggle
[06:09] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> 3.0
[06:09] <Nikashi> Tony_Parker: Then they can do an angle where they say they caught hin doing coke
[06:09] <Diablos> @WasabiKing:. cause if you let engineers promote their own shit, it would NEVER sell
[06:09] <Nikashi> and it's always cocacola
[06:09] <Diablos> see: Ken K
[06:09] <Diablos> 4D
[06:09] <Diablos> two jobs
[06:09] <Diablos> etc
[06:09] <minty> shit, ps2 sold
[06:09] <ZombieSupaStar> that german was sweet tho huh wasabi
[06:09] <WasabiKing> he was enthusiastic
[06:09] <Nikashi> I knew Kennedy was gonna rock the first time that mic dropped
[06:09] <WasabiKing> what you talkin' about zombie
[06:09] <Diablos> he's a brilliant engineer
[06:09] <ZombieSupaStar> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJEjuWuBguE
[06:09] <Diablos> sucks at marketing tho
[06:09] <Diablos> not his forte
[06:09] <ZombieSupaStar> sounds like an asian jim ross
[06:10] <TheDarkShinobi> nintendo's r&d has a bunch of 360's in hand, so they can refurbish them as wii 2's in 2012
[06:10] <Diablos> and it showed
[06:10] <ZombieSupaStar> GOOD GAWD ALMIGHTY
[06:10] <WasabiKing> you have to have people rein them in
[06:10] <ZombieSupaStar> GOOD GAWD ALMIGHTY
[06:10] <WasabiKing> just like the PR person Dyack hired
[06:10] <Nikashi> TheDarkShinobi: You mean Wii 3s
[06:10] <Diablos> fuck dyack
[06:10] <Nikashi> Wii 2 is Xbox
[06:10] <WasabiKing> essentially a glorified assistant
[06:10] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Some engineers do though, diablos
[06:10] <WasabiKing> cause a real PR person would step in and work with the message
[06:10] <minty> btw, was too human shown?
[06:10] <Diablos> Ken was arrogant
[06:10] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[06:10] <WasabiKing> Ken K caught lightning in the bottle
[06:10] <WasabiKing> twice
[06:11] <minty> i miss krazy k
[06:11] <WasabiKing> and let's be honest
[06:11] <Diablos> even when PS3 was still in early stages of development: "all I can tell you is that it will be expensive"
[06:11] <TheDarkShinobi> kk was out to lunch
[06:11] <Nikashi> Oh yah
[06:11] <Nikashi> has Denis shot himself in the head yet
[06:11] <WasabiKing> would you question someone on a hot streak?
[06:11] <Diablos> he let everything go to his head and sony didn't really put a leash on anything
[06:11] <Diablos> they just kinda let him go
[06:11] <WasabiKing> you sure don't with athletes
[06:11] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> diablos:  they said that about the PS2 though, too
[06:11] <WasabiKing> well, he made his bed, and he's lying in it
[06:11] <WasabiKing> lol
[06:11] <WasabiKing> accountability is a must too
[06:11] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> which is why I thought they were going to drop a $350 price bomb or something
[06:12] <WasabiKing> but to what level, cause if it's extreme, not a lot of people are willing to take a chance again
[06:12] <Nikashi> I still mildly want a Wii
[06:12] <Nikashi> but only just
[06:12] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> difference is they designed the PS2 to be a unit that they could sell for a 100-200 dollar loss at 300-400 dollars
[06:12] <TheDarkShinobi> well, you were half right
[06:12] <Nikashi> storage issues would be... issues
[06:12] <TheDarkShinobi> they dropped a price bomb
[06:12] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> while the PS3 was a 200 dollar loss at 600 dollars
[06:12] <Diablos> well that's just it gaime :P
[06:12] <WasabiKing> well the way they defended it was retarded
[06:12] <Nikashi> WasabiKing: Hey, if you want it that bad get a 2nd job
[06:12] <WasabiKing> should have been treated like most Sony products
[06:12] <TheDarkShinobi> I remember when nikkei news said that ps3 would cost 850 to manufacture
[06:12] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> if they had put a DVD drive in, for one, they could have saved like 100 dollars
[06:12] <WasabiKing> and not talk about the price ever
[06:12] <TheDarkShinobi> and sony bots were like LOLZ WTF DOES NIKKEI KNOW ANYWAY
[06:13] <TheDarkShinobi> if anything, nikkei was generous
[06:13] <OrinX> gaime
[06:13] <WasabiKing> well it's assumed that cost to manufacture will go down after time
[06:13] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> What
[06:13] * Gaime-SuperWaggle slaps OrinX around a bit with a large trout
[06:13] <minty> uhoh
[06:13] <Diablos> i do admire sony for trying to take bold steps with blu ray for example
[06:13] <OrinX> can u get all the dijin in golden sun 2 without the golden sun transfer?
[06:13] <TheDarkShinobi> ps3 was needed for the bluray fight
[06:13] <WasabiKing> yeah
[06:13] <WasabiKing> period
[06:13] <Diablos> can't rely on dvd-9 forever
[06:13] <WasabiKing> trojan horse for blu-ray
[06:13] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> no, orin, I don't believe so
[06:13] <OrinX> lame
[06:13] <Diablos> gotta wonder what MS will use next-gen
[06:13] <TheDarkShinobi> and as I've said for a while, bluray is sony's baby for the next five to ten years
[06:13] <Diablos> if they stick with DVD
[06:13] <Diablos> lulz
[06:14] <WasabiKing> DVD is fine
[06:14] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> there are I think like 5 or 6 GS djinn you can get in TLA though
[06:14] <minty> digital distrubtion
[06:14] <TheDarkShinobi> playstation business takes second place
[06:14] <WasabiKing> you just can't get high definition
[06:14] <Diablos> dvd is not fine
[06:14] <M3wThr33> Ehh, DVDs are getting mighty filled now
[06:14] <Nikashi> TheDarkShinobi: Bluray 360 kthx
[06:14] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Orin:  Just use a password from gamefaqs or something
[06:14] <Diablos> 7.4GB is quite limited for this generation
[06:14] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> oh and enjoy the hour-long input
[06:14] <WasabiKing> that's cause everyone is lazy
[06:14] <Diablos> unless you are on wii
[06:14] <TheDarkShinobi> hehe
[06:14] <M3wThr33> The Wii is fine because we don't need hi-res textures and assets
[06:14] <Diablos> XBFS doesn't even allow the full 8.5GB goddam
[06:14] <WasabiKing> but this gen is basically how the PC market was 15 years ago
[06:14] <M3wThr33> Hell, it has enough problems doing 3D sound
[06:15] <Tre`> so
[06:15] <Tre`> anymore lulz/
[06:15] <WasabiKing> soon all game will need to be installed on HD cause devs need to cheat
[06:15] <WasabiKing> then games will come out buggy
[06:15] <sp0rsk> how many hours till nintendo aka the next fanboy meltdown?
[06:15] <WasabiKing> with a patch released before launch day
[06:15] <TheDarkShinobi> 7.4 might be small, but at least it loads within a half hour
[06:15] <Diablos> I could imagine 360 games eventually forcing people to install
[06:15] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> sp0rsk:  likek 12
[06:15] <M3wThr33> 13
[06:15] <sp0rsk> 12?
[06:15] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> 13
[06:15] <Diablos> multidisc installation
[06:15] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> whatever
[06:15] <sp0rsk> gah 1am
[06:15] <TheDarkShinobi> you need to do full game installs of some ps3 games just to get it to APPROACH 360 loading times
[06:15] <sp0rsk> i dont think i can stay u that long
[06:16] <M3wThr33> Then add 20 minutes to that, as they ALWAYS start late
[06:16] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> then sleep
[06:16] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> right now
[06:16] <Diablos> which would of course force us premium people to upgrade from 20GB to 60GB
[06:16] <TheDarkShinobi> which is just lolz
[06:16] <Diablos> which MS will no doubt charge $100 for
[06:16] <M3wThr33> MS's sounded like it started on time
[06:16] <WasabiKing> full game is like the entire b-r
[06:16] <sp0rsk> i want monster hunter 3
[06:16] <jman2050> oooh
[06:16] <jman2050> new Star Ocean trailer
[06:16] <jman2050> Star ocean ftw
[06:16] <Shuri> the hyped for mgs4 died
[06:16] <minty> there aren't any ps3 games that do full installs 
[06:16] <sp0rsk> with that motion plus controller
[06:16] <TheDarkShinobi> Christ, forget 60 gig
[06:16] <jman2050> looks cool
[06:16] <TheDarkShinobi> I'd get a 500 gig hd for ps3
[06:16] <WasabiKing> there's none
[06:16] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> I predict Mega Man Legends Thwii
[06:16] * BlueTsunami has joined #GA
[06:16] <M3wThr33> There's no point of a full install if the game is coded correctly
[06:16] <TheDarkShinobi> yet
[06:16] <WasabiKing> even with MGS4 it still loads from disc
[06:16] <M3wThr33> Just cache the important shit
[06:16] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> ^
[06:17] <M3wThr33> MS is only doing it because their drives are noisy as fuck
[06:17] <Shuri> xbox360 drives are noisy?
[06:17] <TheDarkShinobi> then again, wasn't 360 supposed to be swamped with multi-disc games by now?
[06:17] <Diablos> yes
[06:17] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> but it's so much easier to just read stuff from the hard drive than writing cache-friendly code! :(
[06:17] <TheDarkShinobi> how's that been going?
[06:17] <Diablos> @WasabiKing:. even with MGS4 it still loads from disc
[06:17] <M3wThr33> And storing it to the hard drive is going to open up game to HACK HEAVEN
[06:17] <Diablos> well yes but much of it is still installed
[06:17] <WasabiKing> the best is that games are getting shorter and shorter in play time length
[06:17] <jman2050> "Megan Fox wants to film an entire movie naked "
[06:17] <jman2050> thank you god
[06:17] <Shuri> i really dont like the new 360 interface
[06:17] <WasabiKing> all that disc for nothing
[06:17] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> I still think PS3 and 360 should have scaled back on the processors a bit in favor of more RAM and/or Cache
[06:17] <Diablos> haha
[06:18] <M3wThr33> Yeah, it took MS wayyyy too long to get rid of the fucking blades
[06:18] <Shuri> uh no
[06:18] <TheDarkShinobi> if ps3 was outselling 360, everyone would've coded up sick routines for it to deal with the issues
[06:18] <M3wThr33> I mean, the Media Center interface is fine
[06:18] <Shuri> exactly
[06:18] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Good cache and ram can do sooo much for you when you have a closed architecture
[06:18] <Shuri> its just that devs are like.. eh
[06:18] <M3wThr33> Should have used it from teh start
[06:18] <Shuri> about the ps3
[06:18] <Nikashi> When is the new dashboard up
[06:18] <Diablos> yeah both consoles could have really used 1-2GB of ramz
[06:18] <TheDarkShinobi> you don't waste time coding up extra tricks for the machine that's in third place
[06:18] <Diablos> kojima did
[06:18] <sp0rsk> i bet the new 360 interface sucks
[06:18] <Nikashi> Diablos: He started when it wasn't even out yet
[06:18] <M3wThr33> And from the looks of it, the new interface lacks ads
[06:18] <Diablos> sp0rsk: of course
[06:18] <Shuri> the screenshots were pretty awful
[06:18] <sp0rsk> just looking at it, seems difficult
[06:19] <Tony_Parker> http://www.myspace.com/pinksage
[06:19] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> but for some reason console manufacturers always seem to overshoot the processors and skimp out on the memory
[06:19] <TheDarkShinobi> hell, dc was easy as shit to code for compared to ps2...that shit is irrelevant
[06:19] <Tony_Parker> today's xbl slut of the day
[06:19] <sp0rsk> is it that hard to just have everything layed out simply in front of you
[06:19] <WasabiKing> there's always someone to assist at SCEA
[06:19] <Diablos> ps2 was tricky but not insane
[06:19] <OrinX> "The PS3 is a person who has be diagnosed with cancer. It may go into remission and you may have some good times but you're never going to be what you were before this announcement and you're never going to live to your full potential heh."
[06:19] <TheDarkShinobi> ps2 stormed out ahead, and everyoned jumped on that boat
[06:19] <Diablos> ps3 is like saturn
[06:19] <Diablos> lol
[06:19] <OrinX> WAT
[06:19] <M3wThr33> Sony has stepped up their support as of late
[06:19] <WasabiKing> guys get to fly out to get shit together
[06:19] <TheDarkShinobi> that said, sony really fucked up ps3's design
[06:19] * CajoleJuice has quit IRC (Quit: )
[06:19] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> they fucked up the PS2's design too
[06:19] <WasabiKing> wow whoever said that needs to get cancer, what a fucked up analogy
[06:19] <M3wThr33> It's just fine now
[06:19] <TheDarkShinobi> 360 is easy as shit to port to pc and back, sony should've taken a cue from that playbook
[06:19] <Diablos> if you mean cosmetic design, yes, it looks like a george foreman grill
[06:20] <Nikashi> TheDarkShinobi: MS is pretty good in software support
[06:20] <minty> cancer? wtf gaf
[06:20] <TheDarkShinobi> hell,they wrote that book with ps1
[06:20] <Nikashi> Sony is a hardware company
[06:20] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> thing is they priced the PS2 at a price people saw great value in
[06:20] <Mandoric> also I'm honestly curious what the fuck is up with PS3 loadtimes
[06:20] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> unlike the PS3
[06:20] <Nikashi> Mandoric: Blu ray being slowass
[06:20] <M3wThr33> THe reason the 360 is easy to port is because Visual Studio is INTEGRATED with the 360
[06:20] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> so they got the userbase to force devs to deal with it
[06:20] <Nikashi> it's just a slower format
[06:20] <TheDarkShinobi> ps2 was a $300 console/dvd combo
[06:20] <Mandoric> Nik: except no, not really
[06:20] <Mandoric> I mean
[06:20] <Nikashi> Mandoric: No, it's significantly slower than 12x DVD
[06:20] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Mandoric:   the Blu ray drive in the PS3 is the slowest blu ray drive
[06:20] <TheDarkShinobi> and caught the dvd wave perfectly
[06:21] <Mandoric> 2x BD-ROM is undeniably slower than 12x DVD-ROM, yes
[06:21] <Mandoric> but
[06:21] <WasabiKing> especially when dvd players were bank
[06:21] <TheDarkShinobi> and it's only competition was a console that nobody had any long term faith in
[06:21] <Mandoric> a) the DVD-ROM doesn't read dual-layer at 12x
[06:21] <SuperSic> 2X blu-ray is about 10x dvd
[06:21] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> 2x BD-ROM  comes out to about 7.4x DVD-ROM  iirc
[06:21] <WasabiKing> difference they started the B-R wave
[06:21] <Mandoric> a2) all all X360 games are dual-layer
[06:21] <WasabiKing> versus waiting for the right one to catch
[06:21] <minty> dang this is 2006 all over again
[06:21] <sp0rsk> god, my leg is so thin
[06:21] <sp0rsk> its gross
[06:21] <minty> bd drive speed vs dvd 
[06:21] <Mandoric> b) the 12x is under optimal conditions
[06:21] <sp0rsk> seeing it next to my regular leg
[06:21] <BlueTsunami> Rage engine > *
[06:21] <Tony_Parker> :o
[06:21] <Nikashi> sp0rsk: Got start working that fucker when it's better
[06:21] <TheDarkShinobi> ps3 is up against a 360 with a company behind it that could fund most countries, and a wii that makes $100 in pure profit on every sale with a company behind it that's got 7 billion sitting in a swiss vault
[06:22] <Tony_Parker> DC vs. MK has fatalities 
[06:22] <Nikashi> sp0rsk: like how you gotta jerk it with your left hand sometimes
[06:22] <Diablos> nintendo is ballin
[06:22] <Diablos> no doubt :D
[06:22] <TheDarkShinobi> basically, sony was walking into this gun fight with both hands tied behind their backs
[06:22] <sp0rsk> i...im left handed...
[06:22] <Nikashi> then your right hand
[06:22] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> I still can't believe Sony tried to get into a money pissing contest with Microsoft
[06:22] <stump> Why didn't Pepsiman get a sequel?
[06:22] <Oldschoolgamer> Tony: I'm going to destroy superman for being such a damned dick
[06:22] <Mac> what a dork manabyte is
[06:22] <Mac> http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=327089
[06:22] <DMczaf> woah
[06:22] <DMczaf> RAGE looks really good
[06:22] <Diablos> i was hoping sony would have the wisdom to avoid the multi-sku fapfest
[06:22] <WasabiKing> yeah but those are stills
[06:22] <Diablos> but noooo
[06:22] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> they should have tried to go the Apple route
[06:22] <DMczaf> im watching the trailer, wasabi
[06:23] <Mac> But it does suck to hear that the castlevania guy will have a sword
[06:23] <WasabiKing> is it real-time
[06:23] <DMczaf> yeah
[06:23] <WasabiKing> does it flat out say it
[06:23] <Nikashi> fuuck
[06:23] <DMczaf> http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/19943
[06:23] <Nikashi> castlevania = WHIPS MOTHERFUCKER
[06:23] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> and crosses
[06:23] <WasabiKing> cause they did that with Quake Wars ages ago
[06:23] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> and holy water
[06:23] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> and and and and
[06:23] <Nikashi> mainly whips
[06:23] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> yeah
[06:23] <WasabiKing> won't click, that's feeding the Ziff Davis machine
[06:23] <DMczaf> id didnt do Quake Wars
[06:23] <Oldschoolgamer> lol
[06:23] <WasabiKing> I want to seem them gone
[06:23] <WasabiKing> lol
[06:24] <TheDarkShinobi> what really stuns me about sony's arrogance with ps3
[06:24] <minty> <WasabiKing> won't click, that's feeding the Ziff Davis machine
[06:24] <minty> high 5!
[06:24] <WasabiKing> well, whomever did it at least said their shit was a real-time demo on the trailers
[06:24] <TheDarkShinobi> is that they already saw the playstation name wasn't neccessarily gold with psp
[06:24] <DMczaf> i think splash damage did quake wars
[06:24] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Sony was banking EVERYTHING on the PS3
[06:24] <DMczaf> blame them
[06:24] <DMczaf> lol
[06:24] <TheDarkShinobi> psp was supposed to shit all over the ds
[06:24] <WasabiKing> no, it's GREAT that it said real-time demo
[06:24] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> they wanted to use PS3 as a way to push Blu-Ray AND the CELL architecture
[06:24] <Mandoric> DS: Honestly, if Sony gets PSP success with the PS3, they'll probably be really happy
[06:25] <TheDarkShinobi> and that script got flipped with a vengence
[06:25] <WasabiKing> more of that should be done, even though in theory there shouldn't be a need for it
[06:25] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> to the forefront in processor architecture and disk media
[06:25] * Axord has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[06:25] <TheDarkShinobi> and it's like sony just shrugged it off
[06:25] <Mandoric> Gaime: And Blu-Ray is pushed, and the risks of Cell were shared among several partners.
[06:25] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> they put all their eggs in one basket, though
[06:25] * bluemax_work has joined #GA
[06:25] <jman2050> sup blue
[06:25] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> and regardless of whether Blu-Ray beat HD-DVD or not
[06:25] <minty> cell is more of ibm baby
[06:25] <jman2050> is your game gonna be at E3?
[06:25] <TheDarkShinobi> who the shit cares about cell?
[06:26] <minty> ibm is known for over promising and under delivering
[06:26] <Mandoric> Not to mention, there's a big gap between "all eggs" and "major push"
[06:26] <TheDarkShinobi> honestly
[06:26] <bluemax_work> no idea jman
[06:26] <TheDarkShinobi> especially when you've got dual and quad core pentiums now
[06:26] <minty> power pc ;<
[06:26] <Mac> I've got to agree that VATS seems pointles
[06:26] <minty> AIM..apple ibm motorol ;<
[06:26] <WasabiKing> well cell was a philosophy really
[06:26] <Mandoric> PS3 is going pretty damn poorly, but we're not going to stop seeing Sony TVs next year.
[06:26] <WasabiKing> like how firewire is really IEEE 1394
[06:26] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> whut happened to the POP footage?
[06:26] <WasabiKing> Cell was to be System-on-Chip Integration
[06:27] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> it popped, jett
[06:27] <bluemax_work> any good leaks on gaf today?
[06:27] <WhiteMan> They do make the cell blade servers, right?
[06:27] <bluemax_work> whiteman
[06:27] <minty> blue: sony to buy square!!
[06:27] <WasabiKing> it's a theory that's existed for over 10 years now
[06:27] <bluemax_work> those are just ps3s
[06:27] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Wasabi: and AMD and Intel are  already set to do it a lot better
[06:27] <jman2050> Nintendo buys Bugie
[06:27] <jman2050> Bungie
[06:27] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> whiteman: i think that stuff died
[06:27] <jman2050> Oni 2 on Wii March 2009
[06:27] <TheDarkShinobi> lol
[06:27] <WasabiKing> why even buy bungie
[06:27] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> cell is good for nothing
[06:27] <minty> jman already bought out by nintendo!
[06:27] <bluemax_work> bungie is a one hit wonder
[06:27] <Nikashi> Bungie is just about 2nd party still
[06:27] <WasabiKing> bungie is going to be an abortion
[06:27] <jett\PS3_is_dead_like_GAF> playstation started with kutaragi, and it ended with kutaragi
[06:28] <TheDarkShinobi> tomorrow is going to be lolz
[06:28] <WasabiKing> no ms funding
[06:28] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> marathon was a hit, bluemax_work
[06:28] <jman2050> Bungie got lucky with Halo
[06:28] <Nikashi> WasabiKing: Says who? They work on MS titles they get MS funding
[06:28] <WasabiKing> they've quality games before
[06:28] <Nikashi> They're still mainly 360 devs
[06:28] <WasabiKing> just no backing
[06:28] <minty> marthaton and that myths was it?
[06:28] <bluemax_work> marathon was a hit because it was the only real game onthe mac
[06:28] <WasabiKing> pathways to darkness too
[06:28] <WasabiKing> and one more
[06:28] <minty> no blue. it had that paper plane game as well
[06:28] <jman2050> What little I played of Oni was decent
[06:28] <TheDarkShinobi> nintendo could literally do nothing but play table tennis for the duration of their conference and they'll be called a success
[06:29] <jman2050> Shinobi: I wouldn't put it past them
[06:29] <Nikashi> How about naming a shitty bungie game before calling them over
[06:29] <jman2050> to do just that
[06:29] <WasabiKing> it's just lolz cause I laugh cause people leave Bungie for MS
[06:29] <jakehk> wii tennis
[06:29] <WasabiKing> do the math kids
[06:29] <Nikashi> because only their last 3 games + were hits
[06:29] <TheDarkShinobi> sony, er...I guess they can boast about the death of hd-dvd
[06:29] <bluemax_work> as long as its 1:1 table tennis shin
[06:29] * stump has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[06:29] <Nikashi> TheDarkShinobi: Which wasn't even MS' format they were jsut pushing it to extend the war
[06:29] <DrForester> im telling you, Nitnendo's press conference is going to be done entirely in mii's with Reggie and Miyamoto providing audio fromt eh money bin
[06:29] <bluemax_work> ddk says sony has something
[06:29] <Tre`> "you can use a controller on PC  Same here though, I prefer a pad. kb+m feels so phony." -- wat
[06:30] <Nikashi> ddk said FFXIII would never be on 360 less than a week ag
[06:30] <jman2050> wat?
[06:30] <jman2050> phony?
[06:30] <WasabiKing> lol
[06:30] <DrForester> yes but is that somethign any good?
[06:30] <bluemax_work> ddk is sneaky
[06:30] <WasabiKing> kb+m equals SKILL
[06:30] <WasabiKing> that's the difference
[06:30] <Nikashi> Tre`: We're entering a generation of gamers who started on controllers before KB M
[06:30] <DMczaf> damn, Square still makes some great CGI
[06:30] <Diablos> ddk tells me the sony conference will have a couple huge surprises
[06:30] <Diablos> but he never said what
[06:30] <Diablos> smart man
[06:30] <bluemax_work> dm!
[06:30] <bluemax_work> ncaa t omorrow
[06:30] <bluemax_work> football!
[06:30] <TheDarkShinobi> lol dm
[06:30] <Tre`> Nikashi:  but what does that have to do with controls feeling "phony"
[06:30] <TheDarkShinobi> Lord knows sony needs something
[06:31] <Diablos> ahaha
[06:31] <WasabiKing> fmt already has NCAA?
[06:31] <Diablos> "lord knows"
[06:31] <Diablos> sony needs SAVED BY THE LORD
[06:31] <TheDarkShinobi> right now it's looking desperate for the sony bots
[06:31] <DMczaf> im renting NCAA first
[06:31] <WasabiKing> well he don't exist shin
[06:31] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[06:31] <bluemax_work> i am too
[06:31] <Nikashi> Tre`: Maybe he interprets analog sticks as more directly analogous to movement than kb mouse? I understand that if he learned on controllers
[06:31] <WasabiKing> so sony's fucked
[06:31] <bluemax_work> gotta adjust my gamefly queue
[06:31] <Hitokage> hahah
[06:31] <Hitokage> colbert with the booze
[06:31] <Nikashi> I prefer KB M
[06:31] <OrinX> http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.engadgethd.com/media/2008/07/nielsen_070608.jpg
[06:31] <TheDarkShinobi> hey fuck you wasab
[06:31] <OrinX> ;aw;
[06:31] <Nikashi> but then again I started on that
[06:31] <Tre`> or maybe he's an idiot
[06:31] <Diablos> KB+M for FPS is superior
[06:31] <TheDarkShinobi> speaking of which
[06:31] <TheDarkShinobi> fuck brett farve too
[06:31] <WasabiKing> lol
[06:31] <WasabiKing> FAVRE!

[06:31] <bluemax_work> just for fmt melt down
[06:32] <WasabiKing> nah
[06:32] <Nikashi> Tre`: No that's garbage
[06:32] <TheDarkShinobi> selfish egotistcal cunt
[06:32] <Diablos> tre: Depends on the game.
[06:32] <OrinX> but diablos, without the couch u cant immerse yourself
[06:32] <WasabiKing> miami dolphins!
[06:32] <Nikashi> but thinking one feels more natural because you used it first
[06:32] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[06:32] <Nikashi> that's totally understandable
[06:32] <Diablos> fuck the couch

[06:33] <WasabiKing> it's not going to happen
[06:33] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[06:33] <WasabiKing> and they aren't releasing him for that reason
[06:33] <bluemax_work>    i know
[06:33] <TheDarkShinobi> it's such a mess
[06:33] <bluemax_work> i mjust saying
[06:33] <TheDarkShinobi> and all because farve is a fucking twat
[06:33] <bluemax_work> hes not going anywhere where he cant make the playoffs
[06:33] <WasabiKing> he's going to crush marino's records some more
[06:33] <WasabiKing> lol
[06:34] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> favre to the vikings would be ridiculous
[06:35] <jman2050> it's not like the Vikings have won shit with anyone else
[06:35] <bluemax_work> booty is going to lead the vikings to the promise land
[06:35] <Mac> King of Kong just came on G4.  How do you get a high score on Donkey Kong?
[06:35] <jman2050> it's worth taking a chance on him
[06:35] <jman2050> right?
[06:35] <jman2050> :P
[06:35] <Tony_Parker> lol booty
[06:35] <TheDarkShinobi> lolz @ packer fans btw
[06:35] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> I just mean considering the vikings packers rivalry
[06:36] <Mac> I was beating that game without losing lives when I was 6
[06:36] <TheDarkShinobi> WE WANT FARVE!!!...you just had him for 16 years,shut the fuck up 
[06:36] <bluemax_work> i set my dvr to record king of kong
[06:36] <WasabiKing> if favre comes back

[07:19] <Mandoric> I wouldn't be amazed if PC were to come before launch.
[07:20] <mdm> Nah, that's for babiez.  Other videogames are for babies.
[07:20] <Mandoric> It's not like it'd be the first MM game to go on the PC.  Or the second.  Or the third.
[07:20] <M3wThr33> Wasabi, I loaded the same page up in Google and it was Gay.com as well
[07:20] <M3wThr33> I have NO cookies or anything stored in IE
[07:20] <Kabouter> http://www.gametrailers.com/player/36297.html < Heh Mirror's Edge stuff
[07:20] <M3wThr33> I meant IE not google
[07:20] <mdm> Yeah didn't a bunch of the Mega Man X games come out for PC?
[07:20] <Darkh23> "The only good thing about this whole thing is that this is the bottom of the barrel. It can't get any deeper than this. Hopefully Sony learn something about this and pull themselves up right from this second."
[07:20] <M3wThr33> Yes
[07:20] <M3wThr33> Nearly all did
[07:20] <M3wThr33> Even X8

[07:29] <Unison> let's make an anticipation thread ddk
[07:29] * jett has quit IRC (Quit: )
[07:29] <Schwowsers> Gearbox.
[07:30] <pj> there was already a black character
[07:30] <Oldschoolgamer> lol
[07:30] <Unison> firmware anticipation threads show you're a real fan
[07:30] <pj> they just made him look different
[07:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> now he looks normal
[07:30] <Oldschoolgamer> at first it was teh dude from lost
[07:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> not like typical game negro
[07:30] <nerbo> ddkawaii: he'll just get killed off before the final act
[07:30] <Oldschoolgamer> now its the guy from the wire
[07:30] <pj> i think the characters are all based on real people now
[07:30] <pj> especially the old guy
[07:30] <Kabouter> Dragon Age trailer is lollllllllll
[07:30] <pj> that concept art is too realistic
[07:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> they should base a character on me
[07:30] <nerbo> if the based a character off you
[07:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> http://i34.tinypic.com/29vjynt.png
[07:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> hahaha
[07:30] <nerbo> the text would
[07:30] <nerbo> scroll
[07:30] <nerbo> like this
[07:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> loulz
[07:30] <nerbo> in the game
[07:31] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> I for one think Final Fantasy VII brilliantly depicted black people
[07:31] <ddk_dreamcast2> hey nerbo
[07:31] <Darkh23> man imagine noss, ddk, and raist in the same channel
[07:31] <Kabouter> Universe would tear itself apart Darkh23

[07:31] <ddk_dreamcast2> i'm glad you knew i was gonna ask you

[07:32] * ddk_dreamcast2 kicks gaime in the sack
[07:32] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> that's a red flag!
[07:32] <ddk_dreamcast2> http://i34.tinypic.com/29vjynt.png
[07:32] <ddk_dreamcast2> that's rpetty fire
[07:32] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> and an automatic 10 game suspension
[07:32] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> :(
[07:32] <ddk_dreamcast2> negro looks like he just got out of the blacksploitation version of falling down http://i34.tinypic.com/29vjynt.png

[07:34] <Unison> yeah i saw that DMczaf
[07:34] <pj> someone tell them to stop making every game into a fucking movie
[07:34] <Unison> lol
[07:35] <Mac> King Of Kong really roped me in even though G4 knows jack shit about editing
[07:35] <Mac> They start a commercial while a guy is mid sentance 
[07:35] <pj> NOBODY remembers the story of lost planet
[07:35] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> haha Mac
[07:35] <WhiteMan> Hi mac :-*
[07:35] <pj> not even the developers
[07:35] <Mac> whiteman!
[07:35] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> Are you a bad enough dude to kill some mofos?
[07:35] <Kabouter> God RE5 looks ass
[07:35] <ddk_dreamcast2> i really want gabe to be unlockable in L4D
[07:35] * Mandark has joined #GA
[07:35] * Rukes sets mode: +o Mandark
[07:35] <Mac> I was ranting that you were pushing a gay agenda and pro-abstinece when you closed that condom art thread
[07:35] <Unison> it looks fine kab
[07:36] <ddk_dreamcast2> unlockable gabe = win
[07:36] <Unison> it looks like HD RE4
[07:36] <pj> i think that part looks worse because it's a coop level
[07:36] <Kabouter> Yeah, you're right, but it should look better :P
[07:36] * TToB has joined #GA
[07:36] <Kabouter> And it looks janky
[07:36] <pj> the trailer looked great
[07:36] <Unison> i dunno, i think it looks fine
[07:36] <ddk_dreamcast2> have gabe comeout and while shooting zombies have gabe talk shit about ps3
[07:36] <Kabouter> Enemies glitching and stuff
[07:36] <pj> ..
[07:36] <Tre`> Gabe unlockable in Left 4 Dead would be amazing
[07:36] <pj> its not coming out for a year
[07:36] * BK has joined #GA
[07:36] <Unison> 8 months
[07:36] <pj> he's already in the game
[07:36] <Mandark> Wasn't E3 dead forever?  Whatever happened to that?
[07:36] <Unison> but yeah
[07:36] <ddk_dreamcast2> tre - it really needs to happen
[07:36] <pj> didnt you see the shacknews trailer?
[07:36] <Kabouter> Not saying they won't fix it :P
[07:36] <Kabouter> Just saying it looks janky now :P
[07:37] <ddk_dreamcast2> tre - gave himself has said he's waiting for the first appropriate game for himself to appear in
[07:37] <ddk_dreamcast2> haha
[07:37] <Tre`> Mandark:  this is Neutered E3
[07:37] <Tre`> but
[07:37] <pj> early game looks early
[07:37] <Tre`> however
[07:37] <ddk_dreamcast2> tre - the way gabe looks SCREAMS zombie crisis
[07:37] <Tre`> E3 has been super fun this year
[07:37] <Tre`> so far
[07:37] <Tre`> Nintendo rosebudding MS (for no reason)
[07:37] <Tre`> well
[07:37] <Tre`> faux-rosebudding
[07:37] <Tre`> since MS didn't announce waggle
[07:37] <ddk_dreamcast2> im glad id is back
[07:37] <Unison> haha they didn't release any you're in the movies videos
[07:37] <ddk_dreamcast2> id has been away too long
[07:37] <Tre`> MS *truly* rosebudding Sony
[07:37] <Tre`> with FF13
[07:37] <Unison> they are trying to forget that ever happened
[07:37] <ddk_dreamcast2> time to take their rightful place as kings O pc dev
[07:38] <Unison> yeah, no one dare try to smack nintendo down
[07:38] <fallout> E3 has almost always been about the press conferences
[07:38] <Mandark> What I've gotten from checking the front page (do we still call it that?)
[07:38] <Unison> i love how they called the 360 dashboard channels today
[07:38] <Unison> lol
[07:38] <Takuan> Tre`: seriously
[07:38] <fallout> there's rarely ever been any LOL ZOMG ROFL shit AFTER the press conferences
[07:38] <ddk_dreamcast2> tre - the microsoft rosebud = one of the most brutal in modern history
[07:38] <Darkh23> ah well I must sleep....be back tomorrow morning for more lolz
[07:38] <Kabouter> New Saints Row 2 trailer, yay
[07:38] * Himurosexual has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[07:38] * Darkh23 has quit IRC (Quit: zzzzzz)
[07:38] <Mandark> Is that FF13 is no longer exclusive, and Nintendo's releasing a waggle wand that allegedly works.
[07:38] <pj> i can imagine the pitch for YOu're In The Movies
[07:38] <Takuan> Tre`: in other news, fallout 3 looks stupid
[07:38] <Tre`> that's about it, Mandark
[07:38] <Tre`> and yeah
[07:38] <Unison> Mandark yeah
[07:38] <Tre`> fallout 3 looks zzzzz
[07:38] <Takuan> Tre`: stupid nuke weapons -_-
[07:38] <Unison> i think fallout looks cool
[07:38] <Unison> i mean
[07:38] <Tre`> Left 4 Dead looks awesome
[07:38] <pj> "ok, we're going to rip off eye toy, and bob over here developed this tech to edit backgrounds out of video footage, so we'll put people in shitty "movies""
[07:39] <Unison> combat is like 20% of the game
[07:39] <Mac> Vats looks weak
[07:39] <Unison> so no worries
[07:39] <Tre`> and now we're waiting to see if Dragon Age will get Consolized
[07:39] <pj> i like that you can pick up anything
[07:39] <pj> like in oblivion
[07:39] <pj> so few games do that
[07:39] <fallout> VATS looks ... jarring, to be honest
[07:39] <Kabouter> Well, if that screenshot was any indication Tre`....
[07:39] <pj> so dont use it
[07:39] <Mandark> The Nintendo announcement reminds me of when they released the second version of the GBA with a better screen.
[07:39] <fallout> Tre`: I read that it was going to be ... which makes very little sense to me considering the screen shot
[07:39] <Tre`> well yeah
[07:39] <Tre`> that screenshot definitely DOESN'T look like it
[07:39] <Tre`> no, fallout
[07:39] <Mandark> Kind of a tacit admission that the original model wasn't so great.
[07:39] <Tre`> I mean consolized as in "streamlined"
[07:39] <fallout> oho
[07:39] <Takuan> vats looks like something you'll want to disable after a bit anyway
[07:40] <pj> i like the camera angles for it
[07:40] <fallout> didn't realize that your trolling had reach vernacular stage 
[07:40] <pj> seems to pick good ones
[07:40] <Unison> know what will be absurd and will go on for far too long?
[07:40] <Unison> the Wii Music concert tomorrow
[07:40] <Unison> lol
[07:40] <pj> lol
[07:40] <pj> nintendo's shit will be so sad
[07:40] <Tre`> haha
[07:40] * Ed has joined #GA
[07:40] <fallout> it'll be another montage
[07:40] <Tre`> Nintendo's conference is going to be so boring
[07:40] <Unison> that will be horrible
[07:40] <pj> square will come out and be like
[07:40] <Tre`> "WE'RE WINNING"
[07:40] <Unison> they'll play Hickory Dickory Dock or something
[07:40] <Tre`> "NOW HERE'S SOME SEQUELS TO SEQUELS"
[07:40] <Unison> or the same Super Mario Bros theme
[07:40] <Unison> lol
[07:40] <DrForester> Nintendo will play we are the champions on wii music
[07:40] <Tre`> "AND HERE'S SOME FANWANK SHIT"
[07:40] <fallout> "hey look, more stuff to make us money"
[07:40] <pj> "oh, one more thing, we're porting ff5 to ds, for $40, enjoy assholes"
[07:41] <Oldschoolgamer> better yet tre: "my wife plays this and my dog watched"
[07:41] <Unison> yeah
[07:41] <Unison> haha
[07:41] <DrForester> Tre, dont' forget FFXIII to be bundles with the SuperWaggle
[07:41] <Oldschoolgamer> "hope you enjoy"
[07:41] <pj> oh my god
[07:41] <Ed> ever since they nerfed pyros back to normality TF2 there's been a influx of demomen again agh
[07:41] <pj> the demonstrations will be awful
[07:41] <Mac> If killing people FPS style is made fun then I really won't care.  But then VAT's it just going to look stupid 
[07:41] <Tre`> they didn't nerf pyros back to normality
[07:41] <Unison> MS is making games for Rockstar Grandmas now though
[07:41] <Oldschoolgamer> what pyros have you played against?
[07:41] <Unison> so nintendo better look out
[07:41] <Oldschoolgamer> lolol
[07:41] <Unison> i think grandma wants a 360
[07:41] <Tre`> they added a little bit of damage drop-off, but nowhere near as much as before
[07:41] <Unison> after today's conference
[07:41] <DrForester> Nintendo actually offered to buy 100,000 PS3s if SOny's guys would do their press conference, in Luigi and Mario costumes
[07:41] <Ed> they nerfed the backburner too
[07:41] <Tre`> I still see pyros non-stop
[07:42] <Ed> the backcrit is far less likely
[07:42] <Unison> sony would accept that offer
[07:42] <Oldschoolgamer> the health bonus + backburner = ownage
[07:42] <Unison> they are that desperate
[07:42] <Tre`> the backcrit was always less likely
[07:42] <Tre`> very tiny "window"
[07:42] <Ed> No it wasn't
[07:42] <Tre`> yes
[07:42] <Tre`> it was
[07:42] <Ed> it was fixed in about a week
[07:42] <ddk_dreamcast2> ninetndo is gonna show youtube videos
[07:42] <Tre`> you pretty much always had to be squared up with the back
[07:42] <ddk_dreamcast2> and sales charts
[07:42] <ddk_dreamcast2> when you are #1
[07:42] <DrForester> backburner is just lame
[07:42] <ddk_dreamcast2> powerpoiunt must take up 50% of the show
[07:42] <DrForester> ANgry Nintendo nerd will host the press conference
[07:42] <ddk_dreamcast2> powerpoint is the game giant e-penis
[07:42] <ddk_dreamcast2> dind't'cha know?
[07:42] * Visceir has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[07:43] <Oldschoolgamer> you might be seeing more demoman, because it makes sense against the bastards running with flamethrowers
[07:43] <Oldschoolgamer> and sentries
[07:43] <Ed> when you first got a backburner you could charge behind anything and most like it was a crit, now you need to be facing down a straight line
[07:43] <Tre`> there's still no shortage of pyros
[07:43] <Ed> valve does adjustments that aren't noted on the list, like the sniper's 300ms scope view
[07:43] <Tre`> oh so you're paranoid
[07:44] <Tre`> scared of the stealth nerf
[07:44] <Ed> what? they admit to it
[07:44] <Ed> I don't care about nerfing, they were appropriate fixes
[07:44] <Oldschoolgamer> if anything needs work its the winbombs. 
[07:44] <Ed> I've only seen like 3 or 4 players as pyros on one team now
[07:45] <DrForester> the server i usualyl play on has prett ymuch balanced out pyro wise
[07:45] <Oldschoolgamer> 3 or 4 is a lot depending on size
[07:45] <Ed> Grenade launcher needs a 6 canister clip and the stickbombs shouldn't detonate in the air.

[07:46] * WasabiKing has quit IRC (Quit: )
[07:46] <Ed> On the something awful servers there's about 2, 3 tops
[07:46] <ddk_dreamcast2> "trick my life"
[07:47] <Oldschoolgamer> he just said hoodrats in the trailer
[07:47] <Oldschoolgamer> mega lolz
[07:47] <Tre`> 30 player servers, lawl
[07:47] <Tre`> 30 player servers are always going to have more spammable classes than others
[07:47] <Mac> Wait, the purpose of the show Hurl is to not vomit?  weak
[07:47] <Oldschoolgamer> "randy the tranny" <---lmao
[07:47] <Tre`> more players = more random kills from indescriminate fire.
[07:48] <Ed> well duh
[07:48] <Tre`> I still see 3-4 pyros on 24 player servers
[07:48] <Tre`> not so many soldiers
[07:48] <Tre`> if any soldiers
[07:48] <fallout> soldiers use to be the big spam class
[07:48] <Ed> I play soldier on SA's 24 player servers
[07:48] <Tre`> very rarely demomen, unless it's dustbowl
[07:48] <Ed> Pffft soliders are awesome
[07:48] * ZombieSupaStar has joined #GA
[07:48] <fallout> I still see quite a few demomen ... but ... I play with gaffers, who seem to be quite fond of them
[07:49] <DrForester> i see demo and engineer spam on dustbowl alot
[07:49] * stump-away has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[07:49] <Tre`> dustbowl was made for engineers and demomen
[07:49] <Oldschoolgamer> ddk: the trailer is hilarious
[07:49] * stump has joined #GA
[07:49] <fallout> I am so sick of dustbowl, actually
[07:49] <DrForester> Dustbowl was made so you can ridcule and laugh at any team retarded enough to actualyl loose the last cap
[07:49] <fallout> it's like every fucking time ... rtv --> dustbowl
[07:49] <Tre`> Dustbowl and Dustrush
[07:49] <Tre`> zzzzz
[07:49] <Tre`> yeah
[07:49] <Ed> it's stupid when they can use the stickylauncher as a odd man's rocket launcher.
[07:50] <Tre`> that's allllllll it is
[07:50] <ddk_dreamcast2> hey
[07:50] <fallout> it's like, let's bitch about how few maps there are and then play the same one over and over again
[07:50] <Tre`> demomen need the sticky launcher as it is
[07:50] <ddk_dreamcast2> rememver when microsoft's first part 360 games were gonna be $49.99?
[07:50] <ddk_dreamcast2> what happened to that?
[07:50] <Tre`> because the grenade launcher is worthless for anything not spam related
[07:50] <ddk_dreamcast2> why did they go to the normral $59.99 pricing
[07:50] <Tre`> I mean
[07:50] <ddk_dreamcast2> they siad "we dont pay license fees so we can be cheaper"
[07:50] <fallout> why did they nerf it way back, anyway?
[07:50] <ddk_dreamcast2> lulz
[07:50] * Mandark has quit IRC (Quit: )
[07:50] <Ed> no they don't, the grenade launcher doesn't get touched because the sticky launcher is game breakingly good.
[07:50] <Tre`> you can hit shit with it
[07:50] <Tre`> the grenade launcher doesn't get touched because it sucks
[07:51] <Tre`> pre-nerf, it was pretty much 60/40

[07:52] <Tre`> maybe if valve didn't make the grenade launcher shitty people wouldn't have to use the sticky launcher so much
[07:52] <Tre`> but it is, so they do
[07:52] <ddk_dreamcast2> Disappointed.
[07:52] <ddk_dreamcast2> Gameplay was unacceptable. Controls were decent, but the camera (even at Iso) is unforgivably bad. I love NG2 despite the camera because everything else shined. But TH's bad camera with barely acceptable gameplay is frustrating.
[07:52] <ddk_dreamcast2> I played the demo 3 times, hoping I could get around the camera. No way.
[07:52] <ddk_dreamcast2> I felt horrible after playing the KUF:CoD demo, because it's the same issue. A loot fest to die for, but unacceptable gameplay. Back to Champions of Norrath until Fable 2 hits.
[07:52] <ddk_dreamcast2> Pre-order cancelled.

[07:52] * stump has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)

[08:03] <pj> i know
[08:03] <pj> stop participating in that crap
[08:03] <pj> who cares
[08:03] <ddk_dreamcast2> sony fans were saying they didnt care about 360 getting all the other rpgs, because they had the BEST one. but now, 360 alo has the best one
[08:03] <pj> who cares
[08:03] <ddk_dreamcast2> i <3 sony fans
[08:04] <ddk_dreamcast2> you know me
[08:04] <Mac> I wish they would show more footage of the actual game in King of Kong

[08:04] <Mandoric> I want the maximum amount of baww out of this
[08:04] <pj> i dont know anyone
[08:04] <DrForester> ddk are they threatening a boycott of the game like those nutty DMC4 fans?

[08:04] <Mac> So I can see why it's so damn hard
[08:04] <Mandoric> I'm hoping for a year+ delay on US/EU release
[08:04] <ddk_dreamcast2> there are 3 online petitions

[08:07] <Ed> i wouldn't think so
[08:07] <pj> thats the problem with showing games
[08:07] <Ed> Fallout is, uh, the most brownist and greyist franchise out there
[08:07] <nerbo> developers showing some BORING ass footage
[08:07] <pj> if you show 1 level, people think the whole game looks like that
[08:07] <JRPereira> all of this brown calls for compelling box art: http://memages.jrpereira.com/images_own/ultimate_nextgen_game_box.jpg

[08:11] <ddk_dreamcast2> why are you smoking
[08:11] <Ed> I say 15 hours long
[08:11] <ddk_dreamcast2> also
[08:11] <pj> 3x the length of fable
[08:11] <ddk_dreamcast2> the fucking music in fallout3
[08:11] <pj> so yeah, 15 hours
[08:11] <ddk_dreamcast2> is INSANE

[08:14] <ddk_dreamcast2> ph - @ 60fps
[08:14] <nerbo> sweeeeeet

[08:36] <M3wThr33> With the stage kit, the Ion drum pre-order being 360 only, the 360-early launch and such
[08:36] <M3wThr33> And I suggested that they rename the thread from Europe: Turd on a Cake to insult the PS3

[08:37] <nerbo> eh. I'm not liking the new 360 interface
[08:37] <bluemax> maybe harmonix got a c time like us to do the ps3 version
[08:37] <nerbo> looks full of bullshit to me
[08:37] <bluemax> :-P
[08:38] <M3wThr33> It DOESN'T suck
[08:38] <bluemax> :(
[08:38] <pj> the new 360 guide looks hot
[08:38] <M3wThr33> It's just a stripped down Media Center GUI
[08:38] <jakehk> pj ur so gamey in here
[08:38] <pj> nobody is in the real chat
[08:39] <nerbo> I like the new party invite system moving seamlessly into games
[08:39] <nerbo> good stuff there
[08:39] <pj> yeah
[08:40] <jakehk> whens that coming out
[08:40] <pj> fall
[08:40] <jakehk> smh
[08:40] <Tre`> "We'll have those running in MAME soon too. The neat part about the Naomi GDROM is that it's basically self contained: it loads the GDROM into flash, and then emulates a normal Naomi cartridge from there on to play the game. Bonus: there's no protection like there is on the actual cartridges. The people I can publically thank for this so far: tmbinc, MrSporty, and of course Guru. Plus a very important person who doesn't yet wish to be named :)
[08:40] <Tre`>  
[08:40] <Tre`> Haze is trying to get some games running and I'll add GDROM support to CHDMAN a bit later today. Good thing the SH2 DRC is almost debugged[1], because we're gonna need it upgraded to SH4 spec sooner than I'd anticipated :-)"
[08:40] <Tre`> :D~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[08:41] <Bob_Coffee> huh naomi support?
[08:41] <Tre`> Naomi emulation
[08:41] <Bob_Coffee> holy shit

[08:48] <nerbo> UGH
[08:49] <nerbo> scan cards into your vision camera to get new pinatas in Viva 2
[08:49] <Scarlet^bang> tnerbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
[08:49] <nerbo> lets all GO BUY DECKS OF CARDS
[08:49] * nerbo stabs Rare
[08:49] <nerbo> fucking hate this company
[08:49] <Scarlet^bang> playing cards?
[08:49] <Scarlet^bang> or collected cards of..stuff?
[08:49] <nerbo> they're going to sell playing cards in packs
[08:50] <nerbo> that you take and scan in front of your live vision camera
[08:50] <nerbo> and then get new pinatas
[08:50] <nerbo> it's liek eye of judgement, but with even less point and extra rape
[08:50] <nerbo> lol Shane Kim
[08:50] <nerbo> pimping SceneIt sequel
[08:51] <nerbo> so lame
[08:51] <Scarlet^bang> whats a live vision camera
[08:51] <nerbo> it's a webcam for 360
[08:52] <nerbo> ugh Kim so needs to go
[08:53] <nerbo> he is easily the lamest person to listen to
[08:53] <Ed> wow
[08:53] <Ed> Fallout 3 had a gun you can make that launches random objects you can load into it
[08:53] <Ed> has*
[08:53] <Ed> like teddy bears and shit
[08:54] <ddk_dreamcast2> i love the fact that im ipbanned from ps3forums
[08:54] <ddk_dreamcast2> :-)
[08:55] <Ed> liar
[08:55] <Ed> I bet it haunts you
[08:56] <osaka> is final fantasy 13 going to have turn-based combat or the "mmo-like" stuff we had in 12?
[08:57] <Scarlet^bang> isnt it like a series of stuff you put in and the character performs then in the order you did or something
[08:58] <nerbo> lolol
[08:58] <nerbo> MS has the worst marketing
[08:58] <ddk_dreamcast2> the douchebag tool dude
[08:58] <ddk_dreamcast2> i hate how he talks
[08:58] <nerbo> it's amazing they can sell products
[08:58] <ddk_dreamcast2> and how he keeps his right hand in his pocket
[08:58] <nerbo> the "Lips" commercial
[08:58] <ddk_dreamcast2> and moves his left hand around his face
[08:58] <nerbo> so fucking dumb
[08:59] <ddk_dreamcast2> is that guy jeffyb's replacement?
[08:59] <ddk_dreamcast2> is shane him the top and that tool the bottom?
[08:59] <nerbo> blegh
[08:59] <osaka> Scarlet^bang: i guess that's better than the autoattack stuff in ff12
[08:59] <osaka> i really got tired of being the healer in all important fights
[08:59] <osaka> just put the AI on autoattack and spam heal on 1 character
[09:00] <Scarlet^bang> i think its like..a charge meter thing and you...cant think of the word for the term, but you choose stuff and things take up a certain amount
[09:00] <Scarlet^bang> i set hp percentages at different amounts for healing in 12 after the first time where i had them set 'wrong' (but i liked it better wrong)
[09:00] <osaka> so it's like semi-turnbased? mobs attack if you just stand around etc
[09:00] <osaka> like in some of the older titles
[09:01] <Scarlet^bang> not sure, ive just heard of the 'ATB meter type thing' about it
[09:01] <osaka> that's cool
[09:01] * DMczaf has quit IRC (Quit: )
[09:01] <nerbo> LOLOL
[09:01] <Scarlet^bang> i know very very little about the game
[09:01] <nerbo> "Lips is definitely going to be the gotta have it hit this holiday"
[09:01] <Scarlet^bang> ask kenta, he probably knows
[09:01] <nerbo> is this guy on crack?
[09:02] <kenta> huh
[09:02] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[09:02] <kenta> oh FF13
[09:02] <nerbo> Shane Kim is now the number one toolbox motherfucker in the game business
[09:02] <nerbo> I hate him more than anyone
[09:02] <ddk_dreamcast2> shionbi - what's crackin dude?
[09:02] <kenta> osaka do you still care to know
[09:02] <ddk_dreamcast2> shinobi - man it sucks i had to ask nerbo how my ass tastes....twice
[09:02] <ddk_dreamcast2> *sigh*
[09:02] <osaka> sure, if you know more
[09:03] <ddk_dreamcast2> dude's fucking up kobe style
[09:03] <bluemax> man
[09:03] <kenta> well nothing is confirmed
[09:03] <bluemax> i dunno how i feel about too lolman
[09:03] <TheDarkShinobi> LOL
[09:03] <kenta> it hasn't been detailed officially
[09:03] <bluemax> i like the aesthetics
[09:03] <bluemax> but the gameplay is kinda meh
[09:03] <ddk_dreamcast2> bluemax - if the camera and controls were fixed it'd be aesome
[09:03] <Scarlet^bang> whats the word im trying to think of kenta
[09:03] <bluemax> yeah the camera is killing me
[09:03] <ddk_dreamcast2> bluemax - i hate how they calculate the new vector or the camara direction
[09:03] <nerbo> I don't know what ddk's ass tastes.. I am too busy eating his gf
[09:03] <Nikashi> Is it just me
[09:03] <nerbo> ahem
[09:03] <kenta> but from what we can gather, you basically queueueue moves up
[09:03] <bluemax> combat feels really detached
[09:03] <Nikashi> or was the next Playstation
[09:03] <Nikashi> really the 360?
[09:03] <ddk_dreamcast2> they do a TERRIBLE job of moving the camera
[09:03] <kenta> like
[09:03] <Scarlet^bang> ah queue or whatever
[09:04] <Scarlet^bang> was thinking of a diff term though
[09:04] <bluemax> yeah
[09:04] <Scarlet^bang> but that works!
[09:04] <kenta> let's say your ATB bar has 50 points
[09:04] <ddk_dreamcast2> nerbo - that's odd my gf is on her period now
[09:04] <bluemax> i keep hiting right stick
[09:04] <ddk_dreamcast2> nerbo  -you must have a mouth full of pussy blood
[09:04] <bluemax> to try and adjust the camera
[09:04] <Scarlet^bang> nerbs all about the redwings
[09:04] <osaka> and certain stuff costs a certain amount of those points
[09:04] <kenta> a melee attack is 10, an air attack is 15, Firaga is 25
[09:04] <nerbo> haha
[09:04] <ddk_dreamcast2> her nerbo, "how does pussy blood taste?
[09:04] <osaka> right
[09:04] <ddk_dreamcast2> "
[09:04] <kenta> yeah
[09:04] <Nikashi> Scarlet
[09:04] <kenta> you basically say "okay I want to hit them, knock them into the air, then cast fire on them"
[09:04] <Scarlet^bang> Nikashi
[09:04] <Nikashi> Never mention redwings again lol
[09:04] <kenta> and they make it look like Advent Children
[09:04] <Scarlet^bang> theyre in ff4!
[09:04] <ddk_dreamcast2> scarlet - P4 is pretty badass
[09:05] <nerbo> err, Rockband 2 is now 360 exclusive?
[09:05] <Scarlet^bang> thats the name of the air force!
[09:05] <Nikashi> nerbo: Timed
[09:05] <ddk_dreamcast2> scarlet - if you can read japanese, you should import it
[09:05] <Nikashi> for a while now
[09:05] <ddk_dreamcast2> it's rad
[09:05] <osaka> what i was more interested of though, is that how will the enemy attacks fall into place in the queue but i guess that hasnt really been detailed yet
[09:05] <Nikashi> Scarlet^bang: I know what thet are :P
[09:05] <Nikashi> they
[09:05] <Nikashi> they're also a shitty detroit hockey team
[09:05] <nerbo> didn't know that
[09:05] <kenta> they probably attack as your ATB builds back up
[09:05] <kenta> same as always
[09:05] <osaka> yeah
[09:05] <Scarlet^bang> persona 4 is a little too texty for me, too much of the gameplay is based on the s link type stuff and id not understand it
[09:05] <kenta> there will probably be QTE-like stuff for counters
[09:05] <Scarlet^bang> plus my ps2 is kind of questionable right now :(
[09:05] <bluemax> how long is this too lolman demo?
[09:06] <bluemax> im downloading the original persona
[09:06] <bluemax> is it worth playing?
[09:06] <kenta> but there's also things to consider like the team aspect
[09:06] <osaka> i really hope they'd go back to turn based stuff, i like it a lot more that way
[09:06] <Scarlet^bang> akai no tsubasaaaaaaaaaaaa
[09:06] <kenta> like what if you can get your dudes to team up and stuff
[09:06] <Scarlet^bang> go nikashi
[09:06] <Himurosexual> BANG
[09:06] <bluemax> ugh i feel like im gonna pass out
[09:06] <kenta> one person knocks them into the air as another person jumps up and kicks them or something
[09:06] <bluemax> 11 hour days are too much
[09:06] <osaka> kenta: i suppose there's combo moves of some sort, that eats up the atb from both characters
[09:06] <osaka> or something
[09:07] <kenta> yeah we'll see
[09:07] <ddk_dreamcast2> bluemax - wow, RR looks better than whne i saw it
[09:07] <kenta> and then there's that time ball thing
[09:07] <ddk_dreamcast2> bluemax - wtf happende to it?
[09:07] <osaka> time ball? :D
[09:07] <bluemax> it got some development
[09:07] <bluemax> haha
[09:07] <kenta> yeah
[09:07] <ddk_dreamcast2> didn't play yet, but it doesnt look embarssing anymore
[09:07] <Firestorm> Konami's E3 2008 Press Conference
[09:07] <Firestorm> July 16, 2008 at 2:30 PM PST/5:30 PM EST/10:30PM UK
[09:07] <kenta> in the top-right corner you can see some sort of gauge
[09:07] <Firestorm> Is that when MGS4 is announced for 360?
[09:07] <ddk_dreamcast2> the menus are still embarssing
[09:07] <kenta> it was explained once, but I forget how it's used
[09:07] <ddk_dreamcast2> why didn't you fix those?
[09:07] <kenta> I think it might even be random
[09:07] <osaka> heh
[09:08] <bluemax> its not my job!
[09:08] <kenta> I want to say it makes things go into Matrix-time but I can't remember for sure

[09:08] <ddk_dreamcast2> for sure?
[09:08] <bluemax> just optimization and bug fixes
[09:08] <osaka> yup

[09:14] <ddk_dreamcast2> that said
[09:14] <ddk_dreamcast2> xbox had a shitty confrence
[09:14] <ddk_dreamcast2> the ff13 stuff was pureley symbolic
[09:14] * SS4Gogita has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[09:15] <ddk_dreamcast2> i mean, seriously now, what rational gamer looks at ff13 and considers it relevant outside japan?
[09:15] <Himurosexual> huh?
[09:15] <Himurosexual> FF is, next to KH the most popular japanese rpg series
[09:16] <Himurosexual> in the wesst
[09:16] <ddk_dreamcast2> the key part in that is
[09:16] <ddk_dreamcast2> JRPG
[09:16] <Somnia> the millions who bought ffxii? heh
[09:16] <ddk_dreamcast2> JRPGs have fallen off
[09:16] <Somnia> hell ffvii sold more in america than japan
[09:16] <TheDarkShinobi> I just find it funny that people were surprised by it
[09:16] <Scarlet^bang> haha, rickroll on daily show..thats pretty old! (and its a new ep)
[09:16] <Himurosexual> what are you talking about ddk
[09:16] <Himurosexual> ff is popular as hell
[09:16] <TheDarkShinobi> ff13's been a dead ringer for 360 for years
[09:16] <Himurosexual> ffxii sold how many? 2-3 million in the us?
[09:16] <Somnia> around 3 in the end ya
[09:16] <TheDarkShinobi> like every other "sony" franchise
[09:16] <ddk_dreamcast2> FF12 only sold 1.5M in the usa
[09:17] <ddk_dreamcast2> that's a good series 
[09:17] <Scarlet^bang> ff12 sold pretty low amounts
[09:17] <ddk_dreamcast2> but definitely not a difference maker
[09:17] <JRPereira> Gaime-SuperWaggle: you there?
[09:17] <Scarlet^bang> comparatively
[09:17] <ddk_dreamcast2> i shuold say
[09:17] <ddk_dreamcast2> they shipped 1.5M
[09:17] <ddk_dreamcast2> square's sales in the usa
[09:17] <Scarlet^bang> (i bought 2 of them :()
[09:17] <ddk_dreamcast2> dropped off 62%
[09:17] <ddk_dreamcast2> in 2007 from 2006
[09:17] <ddk_dreamcast2> and the only reason it didnt was FF12
[09:17] <ddk_dreamcast2> jrpgs are pretty much niche now
[09:17] <ddk_dreamcast2> and they desrve to be
[09:18] <Scarlet^bang> reverting to better times then, when not as many shitty ones get released here
[09:18] <ddk_dreamcast2> hell i enjoyed persona
[09:18] <ddk_dreamcast2> but its definitely not mainstream
[09:18] <ddk_dreamcast2> the tales games are loz
[09:19] <ddk_dreamcast2> and FF12 turned a ton of fans off
[09:19] <Bob_Coffee> as long as atlus brings us the awesome its all good
[09:19] <ddk_dreamcast2> i can easily see FF13 tanking
[09:19] <ddk_dreamcast2> on both
[09:19] <ddk_dreamcast2> like struggling to get past FF12s total sales
[09:19] <ddk_dreamcast2> :-)
[09:19] <Bob_Coffee> ddk_dreamcast2: sad to say it, but i agree.
[09:19] <Scarlet^bang> in total or for each system? i think itd sell pretty high on ps3
[09:19] <Scarlet^bang> in us
[09:19] <ddk_dreamcast2> i think 1.5 total
[09:19] <Bob_Coffee> japanese sells will be fine, in us tho, bomba total.
[09:19] <ddk_dreamcast2> between both systems
[09:20] <ddk_dreamcast2> lookat mgs2 syndrome
[09:20] <ddk_dreamcast2> tons of fans were turned off 'cause it was dfiferent
[09:20] <ddk_dreamcast2> and didnt buy 3
[09:20] <ddk_dreamcast2> ff12 could have rosebudded ff13
[09:20] <Ed> I blame FF12's low sales on FF11
[09:21] <TheDarkShinobi> I blame it all on the spirits within
[09:21] <TheDarkShinobi> or more like the lolz within
[09:22] <ddk_dreamcast2> re: too human's gameplay -> Added depth? You bump into enemies until they die. It's like Hydlide HD.

[09:23] <Ed> Also TheDarkShinobi, I bet the overuse of the franchise killed sales too
[09:23] <duckroll> Zwei 2 is coming out in Sept
[09:23] <ddk_dreamcast2> my friend did The Ark of Napishtim
[09:23] <ddk_dreamcast2> and it was awesome
[09:23] <duckroll> so Ys 7 should be shown soon
[09:24] * errorGAIDEN2 has joined #GA
[09:24] <Ed> It was after FFX that they started milking the franchise heavily
[09:24] <Ed> but I think FF11 was the major contributing factor
[09:24] <Ed> see how I move between numerical and roman
[09:24] <sp0rsk> i finished ys 1 and 2 in the hospital
[09:24] <sp0rsk> i want t know

[09:28] <sp0rsk> ys1 is a game where you bump into shit, ys2 is a game where you shoot shit, and then 3 is a sidescroller
[09:28] <ddk_dreamcast2> i was gonna sleep
[09:28] <sp0rsk> what did they do with 4?
[09:28] <ddk_dreamcast2> but then i got a sleep about mcirosfot's
[09:28] <ddk_dreamcast2> haha
[09:28] <sp0rsk> is sony before nitnendo?
[09:28] <ddk_dreamcast2> so i stayed awke for the lolz
[09:28] <ddk_dreamcast2> i think nintendo's first
[09:28] <ddk_dreamcast2> nintendo has 1 really cool thing
[09:28] <ddk_dreamcast2> they might not evne show
[09:28] <ddk_dreamcast2> haha
[09:28] <ddk_dreamcast2> if they dont show it
[09:28] <sp0rsk> the motion plus or whatever?
[09:28] <ddk_dreamcast2> hteir conference is gonna be bullshit
[09:28] <ddk_dreamcast2> if they show it
[09:28] <nerbo> Mirror's Edge is one of those games that I am interested in, despite it's potential to suck being equal to it's potential to be great
[09:28] <ddk_dreamcast2> it might be awesome
[09:28] <ddk_dreamcast2> haha
[09:28] <ddk_dreamcast2> no idea 
[09:29] <ddk_dreamcast2> but i know sony's will be fun
[09:29] <ddk_dreamcast2> :-D
[09:29] <sp0rsk> haha
[09:29] <sp0rsk> psp2 confirmed
[09:29] <nerbo> something deep inside me says, "Don't get too excited... It's this year's Assassin's Creed"
[09:29] <Kab_uni> http://www.gametrailers.com/player/36207.html < Wow, the Resistance 2 trailer is pretty great
[09:29] <sp0rsk> there was a guy in my hospital room that owned a lot of nintendo stock
[09:29] <Kab_uni> Yeah nerbo, have the same feeling
[09:29] <sp0rsk> so he was really interested in e3
[09:29] <nerbo> the visuals look great
[09:29] <nerbo> but I dunno
[09:30] <nerbo> how do you make a whole game out of it?
[09:30] <nerbo> better be some INCREDIBLE level design
[09:30] <priz> ddk: I'm really happy that Keiichi Yano is doing probably his biggest game yet
[09:30] <nerbo> and they are setting themselves up for high expectations
[09:30] <Kab_uni> Exactly
[09:30] <Kab_uni> And not to mention nerbo
[09:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> Yano san is a fucking badass
[09:30] <Kab_uni> With all that red thing
[09:30] <Kab_uni> How much challenge and freedom is there?
[09:30] <Scarlet^bang> the first pictures of that game had watermarks that i still swear i saw BUTT MASHER so thats what i think of when mirrors edge is mentioned
[09:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> and several people sporsk and i know worked hard on it
[09:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> lol
[09:30] <priz> ddk: he's such a nice person.
[09:30] <Kab_uni> It has the danger of being VERY linear
[09:30] <Kab_uni> Which would make it boring as hell
[09:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> sporsk should join their company
[09:30] * BlueTsunami has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[09:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> and do the vocals
[09:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> for lipzzzz2

[09:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> sporsk can sing about his leg
[09:30] <priz> ddk: like, full on Japanese
[09:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> he looks funny
[09:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> sorta like a mexican
[09:30] <ddk_dreamcast2> haha
[09:30] <priz> his english is so flawless
[09:31] <nerbo> it could be one of those games where you re-try the same level 50 times too
[09:31] <priz> ddk: we met at the GDC once
[09:31] <nerbo> and just get crazy frustrated
[09:31] * TToB has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)

[09:31] <ddk_dreamcast2> so im sure they're doing fine
[09:31] <ddk_dreamcast2> :-)
[09:31] <priz> and he was shocked how much it was selling for
[09:31] <nerbo> also I am skeptical of DICE at this point
[09:31] <priz> and then I asked him why
[09:31] <priz> and he told me who he was :)
[09:31] <ddk_dreamcast2> elite made it so tehy're sittting on phat stacks
[09:31] <ddk_dreamcast2> LOL
[09:31] <priz> ddk: Sony better show the Last Guy
[09:31] <ddk_dreamcast2> he was pissed he couldnt ge tin on that gravy train
[09:32] <Kab_uni> Ugh, if it's one of those games where you have to keep retrying, PASS nerbo.
[09:32] <Kab_uni> I hate that
[09:32] <ddk_dreamcast2> last guy's there

[09:32] <ddk_dreamcast2> bad company sucks
[09:32] <ddk_dreamcast2> :-(
[09:32] <ddk_dreamcast2> idea is graet
[09:32] <nerbo> Bad Company would OKAY... if it didn't have the Battlefield name on it
[09:32] <ddk_dreamcast2> and destructable stuff is rad
[09:32] <ddk_dreamcast2> but jeez
[09:32] <nerbo> but it's an insult to the franchise
[09:32] <ddk_dreamcast2> the game sorta blows

[09:48] <duckroll> we have no idea if the US version is patched or not
[09:48] <Firestorm> Like? >_>
[09:48] <duckroll> but the developer was so incompetent that they couldnt do it for the JP release
[09:48] <duckroll> at all
[09:48] <priz> duckroll: yeah, I'm trying to find that JP page which listed the bugs
[09:48] <priz> do you have that?
[09:48] <duckroll> lots of physics bugs
[09:48] <duckroll> not at the moment
[09:48] <priz> ok
[09:48] <duckroll> you could be using the rope
[09:48] <duckroll> and weird shit happens
[09:48] <duckroll> or you get stuck in a loop
[09:48] <duckroll> etc
[09:48] <nerbo> "I bet we end up finding out that the game cost too much damn money to make and they had to bring it to 360 to make it work financially. "
[09:49] <nerbo> no shit sherlock
[09:49] <duckroll> its the same developer that did coding for Culdcept Saga
[09:49] <duckroll> and ended up leaving it with a ton of bugs
[09:49] <duckroll> fucking pathetic code house
[09:50] * Bob_Coffee is now known as Bob_CoffeeAway

[09:51] <ddk_dreamcast2> never change
[09:51] <ddk_dreamcast2> I remember back in the day when I said John Carmack lacked the fortitude of being one of gaming development icons, however this teaser has peaked my interest.
[09:51] <TheDarkShinobi> [02:58]	<nerbo>	"I bet we end up finding out that the game cost too much damn money to make and they had to bring it to 360 to make it work financially. "

[09:53] <ddk_dreamcast2> and uhh
[09:53] <Ed> john carmack not having fortitude?
[09:53] <ddk_dreamcast2> john carmack is one of the smartest AND nicest guys in the industry

[09:53] <ddk_dreamcast2> especially whent hey cal lhim a game designer
[09:53] <ddk_dreamcast2> lulz
[09:53] <Ed> he's not a game designer
[09:53] <ddk_dreamcast2> when i was in colege and tried to write a software renderer
[09:53] <Ed> just a fucking genius who workds with game code
[09:53] <ddk_dreamcast2> i wrote him emails often
[09:53] <ddk_dreamcast2> and he replied to everyone
[09:54] * mdm has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[09:54] <ddk_dreamcast2> sometimes with code or examples to explian stuff to me
[09:54] <Ed> who just so happened to invent the fpser genre

[09:54] <Ed> Actually wait, true fact:
[09:54] <ddk_dreamcast2> and willing to help other folks out
[09:54] <Ed> When ID created the FPSer genre, they actually wanted to patient it.
[09:54] <nerbo> this is realy the best gif ever: http://i38.tinypic.com/2i6ja9.gif
[09:54] <TheDarkShinobi> carmack even lent dd his ferrari a few times
[09:54] <ddk_dreamcast2> well no
[09:54] <ddk_dreamcast2> :-)
[09:54] <TheDarkShinobi> so he could pick up hunnies
[09:55] <soakrates> Carmack is cool in my book because he distanced himself from John Romero
[09:55] <ddk_dreamcast2> never, ever touch another mans car
[09:55] <Ed> As soon as John Carmack found out, he immediately threatened to leave the company right then and there
[09:55] <TheDarkShinobi> cause he was a bit shy back then
[09:55] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[09:55] <ddk_dreamcast2> uhh
[09:55] <ddk_dreamcast2> romero is also a nice gu
[09:55] <ddk_dreamcast2> guy
[09:55] <ddk_dreamcast2> :-)
[09:55] <ddk_dreamcast2> and a REALLY talented level designer
[09:55] <Nikashi> yeah but he said he was gonna make me his bitch
[09:55] <ddk_dreamcast2> its just he's not good at management
[09:55] <Nikashi> and he did no such thing
[09:55] <Ed> I miss the ID trio
[09:55] <ddk_dreamcast2> i wish they were together
[09:55] <soakrates> not good at management
[09:55] <Ed> Remember that American McGee was also a original ID staffer
[09:55] <ddk_dreamcast2> romero has a REALLY good eye for design
[09:55] <soakrates> and an egotistical fuckball
[09:55] <ddk_dreamcast2> lulz
[09:55] <ddk_dreamcast2> american had a shitty white toyota MR2
[09:55] <ddk_dreamcast2> ahd drove like a maniac
[09:55] <ddk_dreamcast2> haha
[09:56] <soakrates> at least if Daikatana is any indication
[09:56] <ddk_dreamcast2> never forget
[09:56] <ddk_dreamcast2> ionstorm made two amazing games
[09:56] <ddk_dreamcast2> deus ex and anachronox
[09:56] <ddk_dreamcast2> only daikatana was shitty
[09:56] <soakrates> lol and he barely had anything to do with either of them
[09:56] <soakrates> Deus Ex was great
[09:56] <TheDarkShinobi> yeah, I remember anachronox
[09:56] <ddk_dreamcast2> both were amazing
[09:56] <soakrates> hell, it's probably my favorite game of all time
[09:56] <ddk_dreamcast2> anachronox had two bugs though
[09:56] <nerbo> Ion Storm Austin should not be confused for Ion Storm Dallas
[09:57] <ddk_dreamcast2> two crushing bugs that they had to fix with a patch
[09:57] <TheDarkShinobi> romero just got whipped by a blone with big honkers
[09:57] <soakrates> but DX had performance problems out the wazoo
[09:57] <TheDarkShinobi> shit happens
[09:57] <nerbo> the distinction is important
[09:57] <ddk_dreamcast2> lol
[09:57] <soakrates> TheDarkShinobi: haha
[09:57] <ddk_dreamcast2> fuck you nerbo
[09:57] <ddk_dreamcast2> i'm from dallas
[09:57] <Ed> American McGee was responsible for the gore in ID's games, right?
[09:57] <ddk_dreamcast2> do NOT fuck with texas
[09:57] <ddk_dreamcast2> especially dallas
[09:57] <soakrates> ddk worked at Ion Storm confirmed

[09:58] <ddk_dreamcast2> the sorta metal punkish demoic shit
[09:58] <ddk_dreamcast2> not really my thing
[09:58] <ddk_dreamcast2> but  know
[09:58] <ddk_dreamcast2> white people
[09:58] <ddk_dreamcast2> what can i say
[09:58] <soakrates> lol
[09:58] <TheDarkShinobi> lolz
[09:58] <Ed> I remember that he use to work in a hospital before hand and was inspired by ER situations when people had bones and guts sticking out of their bodies.

[09:59] <Ed> Alice was pretty good
[09:59] <ddk_dreamcast2> grimm look interseting
[09:59] <ddk_dreamcast2> but he's using an army of chiense programmers
[09:59] <Ed> don't think he made anything else good :\
[09:59] <ddk_dreamcast2> so tis gonna be bug filled
[09:59] <ddk_dreamcast2> :-(
[09:59] <Ed> he should go back to ID
[09:59] <Ed> so should john romero
[09:59] <soakrates> heh, I don't see Romero going back to ID
[09:59] <nerbo> hahaha
[09:59] <nerbo> "Thanks for selling out your fanbase S-E. I poured probably thousands of dollars into your lap with your offerings on Sony platforms. Your support of the PS3 was instrumental in my purchasing one. Now you're murdering your flagship series for a quick cash grab. Why? Because you have no faith in your fans. "
[09:59] <ddk_dreamcast2> LOL
[09:59] <soakrates> more specifically, I don't see Carmack letting him back, heh
[09:59] <Ed> there was a forth guy in ID too, forgot his name

[10:00] <ddk_dreamcast2> romero
[10:00] <Ed> But he was more responsible for Captain Keen
[10:00] <ddk_dreamcast2> mcgee
[10:00] <Ed> Kevin Cloud I think
[10:00] <ddk_dreamcast2> oh
[10:00] <ddk_dreamcast2> john cash is also awesome
[10:00] <Scarlet^bang> if they were really in the fanbase they wouldnt have started buying square stuff on a sony system
[10:00] <TheDarkShinobi> yes, let's ignore the fact that SIX ff games were made prior to sony ever dropping a shit into the console wading pool
[10:00] <ddk_dreamcast2> but he works at blizzard now
[10:00] <Ed> they kicked him out right after Doom was made I think, the poor guy.
[10:00] <TheDarkShinobi> fucking frontrunning twats
[10:00] <ddk_dreamcast2> btw
[10:00] <TheDarkShinobi> no historical perspective whatsoever
[10:00] <ddk_dreamcast2> blizzard is balling
[10:01] * ALinktotheSnitch has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[10:01] <Ed> they told him to design levels for Doom and he kept making accurate depictions of army bases
[10:01] <ddk_dreamcast2> blizzard is the only company sitting on phat stacks that rival nintendo's
[10:01] <ddk_dreamcast2> haha
[10:01] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[10:01] <ddk_dreamcast2> also
[10:01] <soakrates> TheDarkShinobi: heh yeah, and that Square was fully prepared to keep making games for Nintendo consoles
[10:01] <ddk_dreamcast2> lol@ blizzard "fans"
[10:01] <ddk_dreamcast2> getting angry over a mother fucking color scheme
[10:01] <ddk_dreamcast2> HAHAHA
[10:02] <soakrates> until Nintendo shit the bed and insisted on trying to sell cartridges
[10:02] <TheDarkShinobi> sony bots really are something else
[10:02] <ddk_dreamcast2> uhh
[10:02] <ddk_dreamcast2> FF started in america with FF7
[10:02] <Ed> Daikatana isn't that bad honestly
[10:02] <TheDarkShinobi> square looks after themselves
[10:02] <Ed> it had online co-op!
[10:02] <TheDarkShinobi> like every other third party
[10:02] <ddk_dreamcast2> daikatana is interesting
[10:02] <ddk_dreamcast2> and in fact
[10:02] <ddk_dreamcast2> f you pass the first 2 levels
[10:02] <TheDarkShinobi> no third party owes a console maker shit

[10:02] <ddk_dreamcast2> are fucking terrible
[10:02] <soakrates> I'm there dude
[10:02] <ddk_dreamcast2> haha
[10:03] <nerbo> "Considering the last several FF's have been trash I really don't hold any hope for this one either"
[10:03] <soakrates> dude Muppet345 is king of that thread
[10:03] <Ed> that's the futuristic toyko setting right
[10:03] <TheDarkShinobi> LOL
[10:03] <ddk_dreamcast2> yes
[10:03] <Ed> with frogs that kill you
[10:03] <nerbo> now all of a sudden, total FF whores hate the series and always did
[10:03] <ddk_dreamcast2> the beginning of daikatana
[10:03] <ddk_dreamcast2> is tERRIBLE
[10:03] <TheDarkShinobi> oh, so NOW it's trash
[10:03] <Mac> If megan Fox says she want's to be filmed naked she better put up of shut up and release a sex tape
[10:03] <ddk_dreamcast2> shinobi - remember what i was posting earlier?
[10:03] <soakrates> stupid asshole posted his Japan-expert friend's e-mail address
[10:03] <osaka> nerbo: has to be terrible since it's not ps3 exclusive
[10:03] <TheDarkShinobi> I guess he threw away all his "Wait for FF13!!" banners
[10:03] <Ed> megan fox mmmmmmm
[10:03] <ddk_dreamcast2> shinobi  -sony fans were saying quality rpgs over quantity and that ff13 was quality
[10:03] <TheDarkShinobi> lolz
[10:03] <soakrates> man I've never liked Final Fantasy really
[10:03] <sp0rsk> hey, i can proudly claim ive always hated the ff series
[10:03] <ddk_dreamcast2> shinobi - remember how when microsoft annoucned 5 new rpgs sony fans said well we have the ONLY AAA rpg
[10:03] <ddk_dreamcast2> remember that sit?
[10:03] <sp0rsk> and i have witnesses
[10:03] <soakrates> and to be perfectly honest, I thought FF13 was confirmed already, heh
[10:04] <Mac> I say she's an attentino whore untill her tittes get over an hour of screen time
[10:04] <ddk_dreamcast2> i liked F5 and 6
[10:04] <nerbo> I've never given a fuck about Final Fantasy... still don't
[10:04] <TheDarkShinobi> of course
[10:04] <ddk_dreamcast2> FF2, FF5 and F6 were good
[10:04] <soakrates> but really the backlash is hilarious
[10:04] <ddk_dreamcast2> i also liked FF10-2
[10:04] <TheDarkShinobi> square's been about as meaningful to me as parker bros video games
[10:04] <ddk_dreamcast2> the rest have been garbage
[10:04] <ddk_dreamcast2> FF10-2 has the best gameplay of any ff
[10:04] <soakrates> only reason I would play a Final Fantasy game these days is to see how the music went with certain portions of the game
[10:04] <soakrates> I only know anything about the FF games through the soundtracks, heh
[10:05] <ddk_dreamcast2> lol

[10:11] <soakrates> the raging Sony fanboy
[10:11] <Scarlet^bang> yeah raist was from palace
[10:11] <nerbo> 989 contracted his group to make Sony's hockey game one year
[10:11] <Scarlet^bang> from puerto rico
[10:11] <TheDarkShinobi> actually talked to raist on icq a month or two ago
[10:11] <Scarlet^bang> and he
[10:11] <Scarlet^bang> talked
[10:11] <nerbo> then he bailed and went to Insomniac

[10:14] <soakrates> <Sony> Here's a new sku that you probably won't be playing FFXIII on!
[10:14] <TheDarkShinobi> lolz @ new ps3 sku
[10:14] <TheDarkShinobi> the one thing they're beating ms in
[10:14] <nerbo> LOLOLOL
[10:14] <nerbo> "I don't know how much the rest of you know about Japanese culture (I'm an expert), but honor and shame are huge parts of it. It's not like it is in America where you can become successful by being an asshole. If you screw someone over in Japan, you bring shame to yourself, and the only way to get rid of that shame is repentance. "
[10:14] <frod> one with no hdd
[10:14] <Bob_Coffee> our rep is actually the district mgr for the area, so i think its pretty crediable.
[10:14] <soakrates> <Sony> ...unless you're an idiot
[10:14] <soakrates> <Sony> are you an idiot?
[10:14] <nerbo> "What this means is the japanese public, after hearing about this, is not going to want to purchase FFXIII for either system, nor will they purchase any of Square's games. This is HUGE. You can laugh all you want, but Square has alienated an entire market with this move."
[10:14] <soakrates> <Sony> please say you're an idiot

[11:03] <Nikashi> Dan in SF4
[11:03] <Nikashi> dammit
[11:03] <Nikashi> I wanna see Chouhatsu Densetsu in 3d
[11:03] <Nikashi> however
[11:03] <Nikashi> it should be an unblockable grab set up
[11:03] <Nikashi> still no damage
[11:04] <Nikashi> but they have to sit and watch
[11:04] <Nikashi> only at full level though or whatever

[11:05] <Bob_Coffee> dan in sf4 will be amazing.
[11:05] * errorGAIDEN2 has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[11:05] <JRPereira> is dan truly in sf4?
[11:05] <Nikashi> He's defeated Sagat at that point right?
[11:05] <Bob_Coffee> isnt he confirmed for the console ports?
[11:05] <Nikashi> JRPereira: There is a 90% possibility 
[11:06] <Bob_Coffee> him and fei long were mentioned as pretty much confirmed for the console ports.
[11:06] <JRPereira> neato
[11:06] <Nikashi> Where's my adult Sakura with a gi and big tits 
[11:06] <Nikashi> Think Makoto with super cleavage and Ryu's moveset
[11:07] <Bob_Coffee> needs more makoto
[11:07] <Nikashi> they need to release SF3 on XBLA
[11:07] <Nikashi> stable port
[11:08] <HadesGigas> it took them how many years to port SSF2?
[11:08] * kyoriP4 has joined #GA
[11:08] <Nikashi> that's a remake
[11:08] <Nikashi> I mean a straight up port
[11:08] <HadesGigas> They'd probably just put SFAC on Xbox Originals
[11:09] <HadesGigas> less effort, higher price tag
[11:09] <Bob_Coffee> they need third strike on psp, with online and ad hoc multiplayer.
[11:09] <Bob_Coffee> so i can get my parry on, on the crapper.
[11:09] <Nikashi> fuck PSP
[11:10] <M3wThr33> I would if I could
[11:10] <M3wThr33> Pic of hot lesbians: http://www.flickr.com/photos/evil_angela/2648741366/sizes/l/
[11:10] <JRPereira> Bob_Coffee: i'd get me some of that
[11:10] <Bob_Coffee> you aint played SF untill you land a shinkuu hadoken on the crapper.
[11:10] <M3wThr33> Oh wait. That was a lie
[11:11] <Bob_Coffee> i need to get a slim tho, or atleast mod my phats d-pad.
[11:11] * Mac has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[11:12] <M3wThr33> I modded mine and my scores in DJ Max P shot up
[11:12] <Bob_Coffee> i can only play GG and Tekken DR with my phats current d-pad.
[11:12] <M3wThr33> Although I still want a slim
[11:12] <M3wThr33> I guarantee tomorrow any new psp-related stuff that gets announced has a 30% chance of being PSP-2000 only
[11:12] <Bob_Coffee> M3wThr33: what did you use to mod it?
[11:12] <M3wThr33> FighterX's mod
[11:13] <M3wThr33> I paid to have it shipped to me
[11:13] <M3wThr33> He cuts up old NES game sleeves
[11:13] <Bob_Coffee> how good is it?
[11:13] <M3wThr33> Just fine. They even come self-adhesive
[11:13] <M3wThr33> Doesn't fix the square button, really
[11:13] <Bob_Coffee> so you can do shoryuken's and all that no problem?
[11:13] <JRPereira> blah, i've seen that.  sounds a bit meh
[11:13] <M3wThr33> It works though
[11:13] <Bob_Coffee> i have no problem with my square button on my phat, its just that fucking d-pad.
[11:14] <JRPereira> is the complaint that the psp's dpad is too slick?
[11:14] <M3wThr33> No
[11:14] <Bob_Coffee> when i play GG, and i use ky or sol, i always end up fireballin, instead of uppercut.>.< so frustrating.
[11:14] <M3wThr33> The complaint is that the d-pad has to be pushed in too far to register
[11:14] <M3wThr33> And makes it a BITCH to hit diagonals
[11:14] <JRPereira> oh so you put some sort of padding under the buttons then?
[11:14] <JRPereira> so they trigger sooner
[11:14] <M3wThr33> Yeah
[11:14] <JRPereira> ah
[11:15] <JRPereira> the slim doesn't have that problem does it? i've got a slim, no issues seen so far
[11:15] <JRPereira> but i haven't played any fighters on it yet
[11:15] <M3wThr33> The slim supposedly had that all fixed
[11:16] <M3wThr33> But the big deal with the slim is that the internal flash is 64MB instead of just 32MB, which is filled on the PSP-1000
[11:16] <M3wThr33> So they're kinda limited on how they expand the firmware on the PSP-1000
[11:17] <Bob_Coffee> slim has better d-pad, bigger internal flash.
[11:17] <Bob_Coffee> which is why slim has cool shit like skype, whare the phat is maxed out.
[11:17] <M3wThr33> Better speaker placement, too
[11:17] <M3wThr33> The hands don't cover it up
[11:18] <M3wThr33> It also is a HELL of a lot lighter
[11:18] <M3wThr33> Recharges over USB

[13:00] <Himurosexual> My hands won't stop shaking. This is ridiculous. How could S-E do this to Sony, who has been their loyal partner for so long. How could they just throw away such a sacred friendship. I feel literally sick about it. I've been buying Sony consoles exclusively my whole life, Final Fantasy is my favorite game series.
[13:00] <frod> sacred friendship
[13:00] <Danj> rofl
[13:00] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> sacred friendship is not sacred
[13:00] <Danj> "How could S-E do this to Sony, who has been their loyal partner for so long." it's called CAPITALISM guys
[13:00] <Danj> businesses are in business to make money

[13:16] <soakrates> I love the look on that dude's face
[13:16] <JRPereira> once i found myself throwing so hard that i'm somewhat convinced that i broke a rib or something - chest still cracks to this day
[13:16] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> it's like  "Why god? D:"
[13:17] <JRPereira> felt like my body wrung itself out like a tube of toothpaste where you get a pen or something and get the last bits out
[13:17] <soakrates> yeah
[13:17] <soakrates> at some point you're just like, "Fuck, what could possibly be left to throw up or shit out?"

[13:18] <JRPereira> actually the first time i threw up during the bout of it i was sleeping commando so i woke up naked in the dark and puked all over the floor
[13:19] <Gaime-SuperWaggle> sweet

[13:46] <soakrates> not much Necro can do in that situation though
[13:46] <Tre`> too nasty
[13:47] <Tre`> if he can stay out of the corner he does alright
[13:47] <Tre`> or not
[13:47] <Tre`> midscreen aegis and got fucked up
[13:47] <soakrates> well he didn't tech roll
[13:47] <soakrates> or he could have gotten out of that
[13:47] <soakrates> at least I don't think he did
[13:48] <Tre`> finally
[13:48] <soakrates> wasted both of his supers though
[13:48] <Tre`> yeah
[13:49] <Tre`> he really just can't handle the aegis
[13:49] <EGM92> ... what are you guys doing?
[13:49] <soakrates> speccing on GGPO
[13:49] <Tre`> spectating some japanese players on ggpo
[13:49] <soakrates> that Necro keeps going for obvious anti-airs
[13:50] <soakrates> keeps getting parried
[13:50] <EGM92> ggpo?
[13:50] <soakrates> http://ggpo.net

[13:51] <soakrates> lagless (sorta)
[13:51] <EGM92> ic ok
[13:52] <soakrates> I hate Urien's standing roundhouse so much
[13:52] <soakrates> slow as hell but it's practically invincible
[13:53] <Tre`> ya
[13:53] <soakrates> or at least seems that way
[13:53] <Tre`> the range on his normals is rough, too
[13:53] <soakrates> yeah, that's why I hate him
[13:53] <soakrates> he doesn't have much priority
[13:54] <frod> Nintendo press conference: 0 Days, 5 Hours, 5 Minutes
[13:54] <frod> Sony press conference: 0 Days, 7 Hours, 35 Minutes
[13:54] <soakrates> but his moves have weirdass properties
[13:54] <Scarlet^bang> how do you shoot the aegis reflector upward?
[13:54] <Tre`> EX
[13:54] <soakrates> two punch buttons I think
[13:54] <Scarlet^bang> oh
[13:54] <soakrates> what tre said
[13:54] <Scarlet^bang> ok i kept just making it go diff distances
[13:54] <Scarlet^bang> (theres EX supers?)
[13:54] <soakrates> well not really
[13:54] <Tre`> well
[13:54] <Tre`> EX in that it changes the normal move properties a bit
[13:55] <soakrates> but when they say "EX aegis that's what they mean
[13:55] <Scarlet^bang> yeah
[13:55] <Scarlet^bang> cool
[13:55] <Tre`> I think Oro has one too
[13:56] <soakrates> yeah
[13:56] <soakrates> this Oro could improve his chances of wnning like tenfold if he would stop doing dumb shit
[13:56] <soakrates> like throwing Urien OUT of the corner
[13:57] <Scarlet^bang> who are you guys watching?
[13:57] <soakrates> gotu vs custom
[13:59] <soakrates> LOL
[13:59] <Tre`> hahahaha
[13:59] <Scarlet^bang> where at?
[13:59] <Tre`> it's always the aegis that fucks this guy up
[13:59] <Tre`> we're in the 3s room, scar
[13:59] <Tre`> should just be gotu vs. custom
[13:59] <Scarlet^bang> oh

[14:07] <Scarlet^bang> from e3
[14:08] <Scarlet^bang> its not too bad!
[14:08] <Scarlet^bang> the other conferences are fixing to start though
[14:09] <dcharlie> yeah, i might stay up and watch the Nintendo one, the sony one is pushing it (3:00 am or so start)

[14:09] <stump> dcharlie: did you read any announcements from yesterday? if not, get off the internet now :p

[14:09] <Tre`> throw whored
[14:09] <dcharlie> yeah, i read them or rather Jonnyram was telling me them via the internal work messaging system
[14:09] <Scarlet^bang> is ff13 the 'craziest' one so far?
[14:10] <stump> Scarlet^bang: of course! how much crazier could you get?
[14:10] <frod> there was a horrible whale dancing on stage at one point
[14:10] <syllogism> oh wow a multiplatform title, how exciting
[14:10] <stump> Uno 2no and Urine the Movies don't have the kind of whiz-bang excitement than FF13 does.
[14:10] <Tre`> holy shit
[14:10] <Tre`> WOW
[14:10] <Tre`> NO RESPECT
[14:10] <soakrates> lol

[14:10] <soakrates> three wakeup shoryus in a row
[14:11] <Scarlet^bang> that seems to be up there on the 'omgmeltdown' thing so far at least
[14:11] <Scarlet^bang> wakeup shoryukens are no respect?
[14:11] <Tre`> no
[14:11] <Tre`> the dude doing wake up shoryukens got fucking punked
[14:11] <stump> Nintendo's 1:1 controller is probably the biggest non-FF13 announcement.
[14:11] <Tre`> the urien he was playing didn't attack him at all
[14:11] <Tre`> he just parried his wake up shoryus
[14:11] <Tre`> then threw him
[14:11] <Tre`> THE ENTIRE ROUND
[14:11] <Tre`> nothing but throws
[14:11] <stump> also the too human demo sucked but we kinda new that a while before :p
[14:11] <Scarlet^bang> lol 
[14:11] <Scarlet^bang> k
[14:12] <soakrates> yeah I feel bad for that guy
[14:12] <Scarlet^bang> the nintendo controller thing is real confusing
[14:12] <soakrates> surprised Urien's stuck around for that long
[14:12] <Tre`> hahaha
[14:12] <Scarlet^bang> to me
[14:12] <Tre`> more wakeup shoryus
[14:12] * dcharlie is now known as dcharliework
[14:12] <soakrates> man if you're gonna wakeup shoryu that much, use SA3
[14:12] <Scarlet^bang> i still think itd suck to die if i had to scratch my arm or something or if you like pick your nose and it kills you
[14:13] <Scarlet^bang> isnt 3 the kick one?
[14:13] <soakrates> nah, that's Denjin
[14:13] <Tre`> the dude's playing ryu
[14:13] <Tre`> not ken
[14:13] <Scarlet^bang> oh
[14:13] <Scarlet^bang> whats he using? shinshoryu?
[14:13] <Tre`> he's got SA1
[14:13] <Tre`> but he's not really using anything
[14:13] <Tre`> he's getting owned
[14:13] <Scarlet^bang> oh, the normal fireball one..ew
[14:14] <Tre`> what's funny is
[14:14] <Tre`> before
[14:14] <Tre`> it was like necro vs. yang
[14:14] <Tre`> and they were even
[14:14] <Tre`> but I guess dude was just fucking around
[14:14] <Tre`> because he switched to Urien
[14:14] <Tre`> and wowowowow
[14:15] <soakrates> heh, Ryu keeps missing meaty strong
[14:15] <EviLore> LEFT 4 DEAD CHARACTER MODELS NOT BROWN ENOUGH ANYMORE
[14:15] <Scarlet^bang> die

[14:15] <Scarlet^bang> kill
[14:15] <EviLore> I WILL PROTEST
[14:15] <Scarlet^bang> destroy
[14:15] <Scarlet^bang> hes so angry :(
[14:15] <soakrates> lol
[14:15] <soakrates> I don't think that red parry was intentional
[14:15] <Tre`> yeah evilore
[14:15] <Tre`> pretty fucked up

[14:26] <Reno-> Tre: who said that?
[14:27] <soakrates> Tre: lol...well he is pretty correct about emphy though
[14:27] <soakrates> emphy is REALLY good
[14:27] <Reno-> emphy is not RX level
[14:27] <Reno-> fact!
[14:27] <soakrates> 'course not
[14:27] <soakrates> but who is
[14:27] <Reno-> Boss
[14:27] <Reno-> KO 
[14:27] <Reno-> they are :D
[14:28] <soakrates> rephrasal
[14:28] <soakrates> who in America is...
[14:28] <soakrates> heh this guy in GGPO saying there are people in America who are better than RX
[14:28] <Reno-> lol
[14:28] <Reno-> what a loser
[14:28] <soakrates> honestly though
[14:28] <Reno-> only people who come close to RX is like
[14:28] <Reno-> Pyro
[14:28] <soakrates> I think Tokido is the best Urien ever
[14:29] <Reno-> and maybe Ack
[14:29] <Reno-> and Ack is not even american
[14:29] <stump> showpost.php?p=11964241&postcount=757 <-- this guy just wrote a fanfiction nintendo press conference
[14:29] * rk has joined #GA
[14:29] <soakrates> who the hell is Ack
[14:29] <stump> like, not a wishlist... a full speech.
[14:29] <Reno-> Ack is a Toronto Urien player
[14:29] <soakrates> ah
[14:29] <Reno-> first foreigner to win a ranbat
[14:29] <soakrates> I remember watching those Cooperation Cup vids from way back
[14:29] <soakrates> man, Tokido was UNSTOPPABLE
[14:30] <soakrates> only guy that could take him was KO
[14:30] <soakrates> even Nuki couldn't hold his jock
[14:31] <Reno-> http://jp.youtube.com/watch?v=HsTKzWGwzD0 <-- that's Ack
[14:31] <syllogism> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5UzK_5DySU
[14:32] <Tre`> Pyrolee's probably RX level
[14:32] <Tre`> maybe Amir
[14:32] <Tre`> but
[14:32] <Tre`> "Better" than RX?  nah
[14:32] <soakrates> I think that guy was just talking out of his ass
[14:32] <soakrates> but you never know
[14:32] <Tre`> yeah
[14:32] <Reno-> pyro isn't rx level
[14:32] <Reno-> if pyro was rx level
[14:32] <Reno-> he could carry a team at sbo
[14:32] <Tre`> hahaha
[14:32] <Reno-> for real
[14:32] <Reno-> pyro is GREAT
[14:33] <Reno-> but he can't carry a team in sbo
[14:33] <Reno-> RX can carry any two people to a final
[14:33] <Reno-> that's the difference
[14:33] <soakrates> then why the fuck is he teaming up with KO and Boss?!
[14:33] <soakrates> err KO and Nuki
[14:33] <EviLore> oh yes @ prince of persia trailer
[14:33] <EviLore> that was awesome
[14:33] <Reno-> easier to win?
[14:33] <Reno-> he obviously wants to win
[14:33] <soakrates> what's funny though
[14:33] <Reno-> but if you put him up with like
[14:33] <Tre`> haha yeah
[14:33] <Reno-> aruka and pino
[14:34] <Reno-> he'd carry them
[14:34] <Tre`> KO and Nuki and RX is a BEAST team
[14:34] <Reno-> he'd be the strong anchor
[14:34] <soakrates> is it's mostly lesser-knowns that have won at SBO so far
[14:34] <soakrates> I think even Daigo's team won at SBO 3S once
[14:34] <Tre`> Boss teamed with Ochibi and Rikimaru
[14:34] <soakrates> and he doesn't even play that much!
[14:34] <Tre`> which is ANOTHER beast team.
[14:34] <EviLore> http://www.gametrailers.com/player/36270.html?type=flv   <----mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[14:34] <Reno-> eh
[14:34] <Reno-> what unknowns
[14:34] <Reno-> most of the people who have won are well known
[14:34] <soakrates> that one team with Oro
[14:34] <soakrates> Izu
[14:35] <soakrates> KO still hasn't won at SBO
[14:35] <soakrates> wait, I think the Oro team was at cooperation cup nm
[14:35] <EGM92> Evilore it reminds me heavily of metal gear acid 2, the art style
[14:36] <stump> woah madworld, bayonetta, yakuza 2, and alpha protocol are at e3.
[14:37] <Tre`> PoP looks like ICO but with a chick who can fight
[14:37] <Tre`> also PoP looks better than ever
[14:37] <Tre`> thank you Ubi for getting off the GRITTY AND DARK train
[14:37] <Tre`> we do not need godsmack in PoP
[14:37] <stump> yeah i like characters with no eye makeup personally.
[14:37] <soakrates> I want Aruka to win at SBO
[14:37] <soakrates> that would be fucking great
[14:38] <EviLore> yes, it's definitely heavily influenced by ICO
[14:38] <Reno-> aruka isnever gonna win
[14:38] <EviLore> and fucking gorgeous in its own right
[14:38] <EGM92> nice I just realized that the song was from Sigur Ros
[14:39] <stump> i guess asscreed massive effect worked out well
[14:39] <stump> hahaha
[14:39] <stump> massive effect
[14:39] <stump> wtf
[14:39] <stump> massive attack.
[14:39] <Reno-> soak: i just played sf4 tonight at the loketest arcade, gief is ripping shit up!
[14:39] <soakrates> there will be no raining on my parade
[14:39] <soakrates> Aruka will win SBO
[14:39] <Reno-> but the top tier players are catching up mad fast
[14:39] <soakrates> and Kuroda will take 2nd place
[14:39] <Tre`> hahaha
[14:40] <Tre`> oh yeah
[14:40] <Tre`> soak
[14:40] <Tre`> did you see that xeromos dude's youtube channel?
[14:40] <soakrates> nope
[14:40] <Tre`> a bunch of SF4 vids from Capcom Yokosuka with the final version
[14:40] <Tre`> http://www.youtube.com/xeromos
[14:40] <soakrates> Reno: I thought the loketests were over and that the official release was out
[14:41] <Reno-> it's not out yet
[14:41] <Reno-> on friday it's offically out
[14:41] <Reno-> i'm just playing so that i get used to the game, really
[14:41] <Reno-> but i don't know if i'll play it seriously, to be honest
[14:41] <Tre`> Abel looks so fun
[14:41] <Tre`> me want
[14:41] <Reno-> SF4 drops this week, VF5R drops next week
[14:41] <Reno-> i can't play both competitively now, especially now that I have a SO that I have to tend to :p

[14:49] <Reno-> wish his FB was a little bit faster fro better traps
[14:49] <Reno-> wish he had a fake fireball like in ST HD

[14:50] <soakrates> wtf
[14:50] <Reno-> no
[14:50] <soakrates> did he get something else?
[14:50] <Reno-> just srk, dp and hadouken
[14:50] <Reno-> nope
[14:50] <Reno-> nothing
[14:50] <soakrates> wow that's retarded
[14:50] <Reno-> he's pure ST with a weakened fireball
[14:50] <Reno-> which is really stupid
[14:50] <soakrates> they took away Ryu's blade kick
[14:50] <Reno-> because SF4 Ken is.... 3s Ken
[14:50] <soakrates> but gave Guile an overhead
[14:50] <Reno-> which makes noooooooo sense
[14:51] <soakrates> so Ken is kinda beastly then?
[14:51] <Reno-> yea
[14:51] <Reno-> he can do mp, hp into fierce srk
[14:51] <Reno-> hits all naturally
[14:51] <Reno-> 3s that didn't really hit unless it was deep cross up iirc
[14:53] <soakrates> gay
[14:53] <soakrates> are there time-release characters in it?
[14:53] <soakrates> or are you at liberty to say :P
[14:54] <Reno-> there are no time release characters :p
[14:55] <soakrates> raaaaaaage
[14:55] <soakrates> I want Fei Long in the arcade
[14:56] <Reno-> you have Abel
[14:56] <Reno-> good enough
[14:56] <soakrates> meh
[14:56] <soakrates> I'm kinda worried that I won't be able to find a character I can mesh with in SF4
[14:57] <Reno-> personally i wanna play it badly but i dont' know if i can play both that and vf5r at the same time
[14:57] <Reno-> if i play both, i'm gonna be way below mediocre in both i think
[14:57] <soakrates> yeah I'd probably opt for VF5R
[14:57] <Reno-> instead of being decidedly average in one :P
[14:57] <soakrates> even though I know they're gonna nerf Lei Fei
[14:58] <Reno-> lei fei isn't gonna get nerfed
[14:58] <Reno-> he's gonna be strong still
[14:58] <stump> wow the comments in gametrailers videos are like sub-youtube level intelligence.
[14:58] <Tre`> wait they took out Ryu's blade kick the fuck
[14:58] <Diablos> hey
[14:58] <soakrates> probably won't be top though :/
[14:58] <Diablos> guys
[14:59] <Tre`> waaaaaaat
[14:59] <Diablos> sony still got tekken 6
[14:59] <Diablos> LOLLLLLLL
[14:59] <Reno-> Tre; Yeah
[14:59] <Reno-> he has no new moves whatsoever
[14:59] <soakrates> old school Ryu
[14:59] <Tre`> i heard people doing like preliminary "tier" shit, nothing serious but just guesstimations
[14:59] <Tre`> and yeah Ryu was kinda middle-ish
[14:59] <Reno-> yeah, pretty much
[14:59] <soakrates> is his EX fireball still really good?
[14:59] <Reno-> top imo is Bison, Vega and Chun
[15:00] <Tre`> US Bison/Vega or japan Bison/vega
[15:00] <Reno-> US Bison
[15:00] <Reno-> US Balrog is also really good
[15:00] <Reno-> he got a new move too
[15:00] <Reno-> now you got 1/3 chance of guessing right lol
[15:00] <EviLore> the quantum of solace game looks like crap, garnett's smoking some powerful shit as usual
[15:01] <soakrates> eh maybe I'll just use Ken at first
[15:01] <soakrates> aaaanyway
[15:01] <soakrates> 5 in the fuckin' a.m.
[15:01] <soakrates> time to sleep
[15:02] <Tre`> ltrzzzz
[15:02] <soakrates> late
[15:02] <Reno-> ooh
[15:02] <Reno-> amazon has buy 2 bluray get one free
[15:03] <Reno-> and i got two in mind now! woo

[15:22] <ddkawaii> the game could be good
[15:22] <ddkawaii> if it fixed the camera and the controls
[15:22] <sp0rsk> good, you would of definitely hated it
[15:22] <ddkawaii> it could be a nice 5 or average game
[15:22] <ddkawaii> on my scale of 1-10
[15:22] <ddkawaii> i gave it a 2
[15:22] <ddkawaii> :-(
[15:22] <sp0rsk> if they fixed the camera controls, writing, skill trees, menus

[15:23] <ddkawaii> but when he interacts with enemies
[15:23] <ddkawaii> it looks ....not so fun
[15:23] <ddkawaii> they should just make it a jungle gym game

[15:59] <ddkawaii> SC2, D3, and STALKER CS going to consoles exclusively
[15:59] <dcharlie> so the second we get the clearance, we officially own property :O
[15:59] <ddkawaii> THAT would make me angry
[15:59] <ddkawaii> that the only video game related shit
[15:59] <ddkawaii> that would really make me pissed
[15:59] <sp0rsk> D3, wii exclusive

[16:04] <ddkawaii> Like I've told many people the only disappointment I felt during the demo was when it ended. I got used to the controls, I had a wicked two-handed sword, and I had just gotten the hang of the "Throw enemy in air, keep them there with pistols" thing then BAM! demo over and me sad.
[16:04] <ddkawaii> I may not be able to buy this the day it comes out (Gears 2, Rock Band 2, Fallout 3 LE eating up much of my disposable income) but as soon as I can I will grab Too Human.
[16:04] <ddkawaii> Only the most die-hard hater could fail to enjoy this demo.
[16:05] <sp0rsk> there are some serious coke sniffers in that thread
[16:05] <ddkawaii> lolll
[16:05] <ddkawaii> that thread 
[16:05] <ddkawaii> comibned with ff13 on 360

[16:05] <ddkawaii> has made yesterday
[16:05] <Darkh23> 3 hours
[16:05] <ddkawaii> the greatest day of 2008 so far
[16:05] <OrinX> sweet
[16:05] <ddkawaii> orin - why are you saying shizzle?
[16:05] <ddkawaii> i've never heard you speak in this way before
[16:06] <ddkawaii> why have you changed your stripes?
[16:06] <OrinX> this is the real orin
[16:06] <OrinX> the other one all these years was an imposter
[16:06] <ddkawaii> fo rizzle my nizzle?
[16:06] <Kabouter> «15:04:36» {ddkawaii} Only the most die-hard hater could fail to enjoy this demo. < I must be one die-hard hater then
[16:06] <ddkawaii> me too
[16:06] <ddkawaii> :-(
[16:06] <ddkawaii> wait
[16:06] <ddkawaii> does the demo have coop?
[16:06] <OrinX> drizzle the nizle
[16:06] <ddkawaii> ets try it coop
[16:06] <Kabouter> I had no idea I cared that much
[16:06] <Kabouter> No, the demo does not have co-op
[16:06] <ddkawaii> maybe it ets better
[16:06] <ddkawaii> LULZ
[16:07] <ddkawaii> too human demo proves that too human is denis' magnum opus! - gaffer, RE too human
[16:07] <ddkawaii> LULLERSKATES

[16:09] <frod> IGN was good for me yesterday
[16:09] <frod> but delayed by a couple of minutes
[16:09] * Diablos has quit IRC (Quit: )
[16:10] <Darkh23> IGN still has it up to watch for free....and its the best video quality
[16:10] <frod> was seeing the megaton in here before wada even left the stage first time
[16:10] <sp0rsk> ign is always kinda on the slow side for me
[16:10] <frod> thanks
[16:10] <frod> hmm
[16:11] <ddkawaii> man
[16:11] <ddkawaii> the art skill of bioware and silicon knights is so different
[16:12] <ddkawaii> the ship scene in mass effect was so nice looking
[16:12] <ddkawaii> the inside of the ship in the beginning of too human
[16:12] <ddkawaii> looks soo bad
[16:12] <ddkawaii> :-()
[16:12] <sp0rsk> ugh, so bad

[16:13] <ddkawaii> but sylvia did so well i was sorta rooting for him..
[16:13] <ddkawaii> haha
[16:13] <Sea_Manky> you guys will have to heckle nintendo without me
[16:14] <EviLore> I love the morbidly obese 60 year old security guys that escort the MMA fighters
[16:14] <ddkawaii> lol

[16:14] * Diablos has joined #GA
[16:14] <Sea_Manky> sp0rks: Sure, I've been trying to beat one of the bastard bonus dungeons in SNES Shiren lately
[16:15] <sp0rsk> ah
[16:15] <Sea_Manky> But Warhawk is the only current gen game I have, and that isn't likely to change for a while
[16:15] <EviLore> no one cheered for nog :/

[16:21] <Sea_Manky> Not sure exactly, the main game is going Greatest Hits, and there are currently two expansions at $8 a pop with another one planned
[16:21] <Sea_Manky> Don't know if they're cutting the prices on those or not
[16:21] <Kabouter> lolllllllllllll, report on the crappy quality of Chinese junk

[16:22] <EviLore> phew, nog's bloodied and wobbly
[16:22] <Sea_Manky> Darkh: I really don't know, it might be already, but if not then soon
[16:22] <Kabouter> It's in Dutch Sea_Manky
[16:22] <Darkh23> ah k
[16:23] <Darkh23> well I better go get my coffee and muffin so I will have the energy to lol throughout the day
[16:23] <Unison_> energy to power your LOLs
[16:24] <Darkh23> yes....don't want to fall asleep during nintendo's sales charts
[16:24] <Unison_> 10.3 > 10.2
[16:24] <Unison_> i dont see how Nintendo can spin that
[16:24] <Darkh23> throw up the reggie *shrug* pic
[16:24] <Darkh23> that's all they need to do

[16:25] <Sea_Manky> I'll need to dig up the irc logs of nintendo fans bagging on sony's powerpoints from previous E3s and see how many of them go crazy over nintendo's today. XD
[16:26] <Acosta> Dragon Age looks gorgeous
[16:27] <Acosta> http://dragonage.bioware.com/_commonext/images/dragonage/gallery/gallery_zoomer_exc_3.jpg
[16:27] <Acosta> woah
[16:27] <Unison_> looks like The Witcher
[16:28] <FnordChan> Sea_Manky:  With Nintendo's Power Point presentations, it's different.  After all, the controller the speaker will have in their hand to advance the slides is much like that of a Wiimote.
[16:28] <Kabouter> looks nice Acosta, but it's no Too Human
[16:28] <Unison_> powerpoint counts as Gameplay on Wii
[16:28] <Acosta> Unison, the witcher has one controllable character
[16:29] <Sea_Manky> hey, maybe we'll even get some "Nintendo innovates E3 conferences with sales figures!" people! XD
[16:29] <Acosta> we are talking of group based RPG here
[16:29] * EGM92 has joined #GA
[16:29] <Acosta> and said that, The Witcher graphically was really good
[16:29] <Acosta> haha Kab
[16:29] <Kabouter> Although, actually
[16:30] <Unison_> you dont need to explain things to me Acosta
[16:30] <Kabouter> That one part of Too Human looked nice
[16:30] <Unison_> i know what The Witcher is
[16:30] <Kabouter> The one where you go on that flying plateau thing
[16:30] <Acosta> I do kindly
[16:30] <Unison_> stupidly
[16:30] <EGM92> Acosta, all the hype for the witcher ruined it for me when I went to play it early last month
[16:30] <EGM92> and graphically it was "ok" nothing special.
[16:30] <Kabouter> Zero Punctuation convinced me Witcher is ass
[16:31] <syllogism> did you play more than act 1
[16:31] * TheDarkShinobi has joined #GA
[16:31] <EGM92> No I didn't, couldn't force myself any further than the beginning
[16:31] <syllogism> i dont think anyone hyped the graphics, though at times it's very pretty
[16:31] <Kabouter> http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/22-The-Witcher < This.
[16:31] <syllogism> the prologue is horrible
[16:31] <Acosta> well, yes, I'm trying to explain stuff to someone who dislike Portal 
[16:31] <EGM92> no, they hyped the game itself
[16:31] <syllogism> and act 1 mediocre
[16:31] <Acosta> bad taste and all that
[16:31] <syllogism> it gets much better after that
[16:31] <EGM92> yea well, if you want to captivate someone into playing your game, MADE THE GAME START OFF FUCKING GOOD.
[16:32] <EGM92> MAKE*
[16:32] <Acosta> but don't worry I will still do it, just for you
[16:32] <syllogism> it's an european game
[16:32] <EGM92> That's no fucking excuse
[16:32] <TheDarkShinobi> too human isn't european!!
[16:32] <Acosta> the big problem of The Witcher is translation
[16:32] <EviLore> the prologue was pretty weird in how it introduced gameplay concepts and such
[16:32] <Acosta> for me at least
[16:32] <Kabouter> Plenty of European games start out fine
[16:32] <EviLore> and yeah I didn't like act 1 much, so much fuckin' running around
[16:32] <Kabouter> Beginning of Stalker is cool enough for instance
[16:32] <EviLore> loved the game from act 2 on
[16:33] <Acosta> veginning of Stalker is pretty great
[16:34] <Acosta> Yathzee doesn't like these games 
[16:35] <EviLore> oh wow holy shit, haha nog man wow
[16:35] <Diablos> lol
[16:35] <EviLore> brutal BJJ
[16:35] <EGM92> are there any better MP3 players than the ZUNE 80gb?
[16:35] <Diablos> ff13 and MS E3 topics
[16:35] <Diablos> forum archive gold
[16:35] <JRPereira> the zvm is pretty good
[16:35] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[16:35] <Kabouter> I probably wouldn't like the Witcher for the same reason Acosta :P
[16:35] <Acosta> did the gifs from MS conference started
[16:35] <Acosta> probably
[16:35] <Kabouter> Yeah
[16:35] <JRPereira> EGM92: have you looked at zvm's?
[16:35] <Kabouter> First thing I thought when they did that movies thing
[16:35] <Kabouter> Was
[16:36] <EGM92> zvm?
[16:36] <Kabouter> NeoGAF will have GIFs for YEARS
[16:36] <JRPereira> creative zen vision m
[16:36] <EGM92> vision M's are shit
[16:36] <TheDarkShinobi> I lol'd when one of the ms guys talked about hooking up your ipod to your 360 yesterday
[16:36] <JRPereira> no likey?
[16:36] <EGM92> I had one
[16:36] <JRPereira> what didn't you like?
[16:36] <Kabouter> I'm pretty happy with my Vision M tbh
[16:36] <EGM92> shitty battery life.
[16:36] <JRPereira> 16 hours play time no good?
[16:36] <EGM92> Not on my work day
[16:36] <Kabouter> How many hours does the Zune get?
[16:36] <JRPereira> you work more than 16 hours a day?
[16:36] <MaddenNFL64> Th guy didn't say zune because people dont own zunes
[16:37] <EGM92> I get around 30hrs or so
[16:37] <JRPereira> do you sleep?
[16:37] <TheDarkShinobi> including him apparantely
[16:37] * Dcharlie has joined #GA
[16:37] <EGM92> you're obviously new here JRP, I don't sleep
[16:37] <EGM92> rarely do
[16:37] <JRPereira> i've never heard any mention of you not sleeping
[16:38] <JRPereira> i thought 16 was pretty good in the scope of things, guess not

[16:40] <ddkawaii> in 2005

[16:40] <Dcharlie> luck bast DDK. I:m back on the SHITICAL path
[16:40] <ddkawaii> acosta - working hard
[16:40] <MaddenNFL64> They should just ignore the audience completely, and act like theyre revealing shit to themselves. That would be fun.
[16:40] <TheDarkShinobi> oh, did you make one of those bullshit ps3 demos dd?
[16:40] <EGM92> Casual gamers would be all "OMFG, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAN PLAY CARDS ON THE THING!"
[16:40] <TheDarkShinobi> maybe that tekken demo with the individual skin pores?!
[16:41] <ddkawaii> shinobi - lulz
[16:41] <ddkawaii> shionbi - i worked ont he KZ2 CG
[16:41] <ddkawaii> i was a animator
[16:41] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[16:41] <ddkawaii> they siad "make as much fake shit as possible" 
[16:41] <TheDarkShinobi> LOL
[16:41] <ddkawaii> i hooked them fools up gooood
[16:41] <Acosta> lol
[16:41] <EviLore> ddk: great fight, sylvia really shut nog down for the first 10 minutes or so and beat him up pretty well
[16:41] <Dcharlie> lol
[16:41] <ddkawaii> evil - yes
[16:41] <ddkawaii> evil - werent you sorta rooting for sylvia
[16:41] <ddkawaii> ?
[16:41] <ddkawaii> evil - sylvia gets so much shit
[16:41] <Acosta> Dcharlie, it seems you were right all these time
[16:42] <TheDarkShinobi> haha, it's hilarious how much shit has changed since e3 05
[16:42] <ddkawaii> it was soooo good seeing him do well
[16:42] <EviLore> but Nog, man, after looking sloppy the first few times with his takedown attempts pulls crazy shit out of his ass as usual haha
[16:42] <Acosta> did some gaffer apologize to you about FF XIII? :P
[16:42] <ddkawaii> nog's endgame
[16:42] <ddkawaii> was fucking amazing
[16:42] <ddkawaii> sylvia thought he had nog
[16:42] <ddkawaii> and then
[16:42] <ddkawaii> all of a suddent
[16:42] <Dcharlie> lol - i never predicted it would go to X360, i said it made financial sense to go, but got burned anyways ;
[16:42] <ddkawaii> nog had turned the tables
[16:42] <EviLore> nog's a scary dude once he gets that first step 
[16:42] <Kabouter> «15:42:03» {TheDarkShinobi} haha, it's hilarious how much shit has changed since e3 05 < Haha, seriously
[16:42] <ddkawaii> yes
[16:42] <TheDarkShinobi> betting against sony on any level meant you were getting an appointment booked for the nearest psyce ward
[16:42] <ddkawaii> thats why i thihk fedor is so amazing
[16:43] <ddkawaii> i remember that sequence
[16:43] <Kabouter> Yup
[16:43] <ddkawaii> where fedor escaped nogs submits
[16:43] <ddkawaii> like 3x in a row
[16:43] <EviLore> yeah
[16:43] <ddkawaii> remember that sequence?
[16:43] <TheDarkShinobi> 360 got laughed off the e3 floor, even though gears of war was already looking hot
[16:43] <EviLore> been a while since I watched the fedor nog fights
[16:43] <Dcharlie> but that proves what we all know - e3 means nothing
[16:43] <TheDarkShinobi> and the dolphin was being likened to the sega pico
[16:43] <MaddenNFL64> i just don't get how Sony let that go. Suitcase full of gold or something. Anything.
[16:43] <ddkawaii> i wathce rthem after we talked about them
[16:43] <ddkawaii> the other night
[16:43] <Dcharlie> i remember everyone laughing at Gears at TGS
[16:43] <ddkawaii> those fights were soo epic
[16:43] <TheDarkShinobi> afterthought doesn't even begin to describe nintendo's status three years ago
[16:43] <Unison_> it's hilarious how meh 360's showing was yesterday, but them kicking Sony in the face with FFXIII made it seem like a success
[16:43] <ddkawaii> im so hyped for fedor's next fight
[16:44] <ddkawaii> especially for the uneducated mma fans
[16:44] <ddkawaii> i want them to be shut down
[16:44] <ddkawaii> :-)
[16:44] <Kabouter> «15:43:43» {Dcharlie} i remember everyone laughing at Gears at TGS < I was laughing during playthroughs
[16:44] <TheDarkShinobi> I figured e3 2000 would've cemented the fact that e3 doesn't mean shit
[16:44] <Kabouter> Gears just makes me laugh :P
[16:44] <TheDarkShinobi> but people keep on forgetting the lessons
[16:44] <TheDarkShinobi> or ignoring them
[16:44] <Acosta> I laughed with the juice
[16:44] <Acosta> best comedy line ever
[16:44] <ddkawaii> look at all dat juice
[16:44] <ddkawaii> and carmine AND kim are back
[16:44] <ddkawaii> hahah
[16:44] <ddkawaii> wtf
[16:44] <MaddenNFL64> ???
[16:45] <Dcharlie> REVERSE ASIAN THEORY
[16:45] <MaddenNFL64> Multi?
[16:45] <ddkawaii> tes
[16:45] <ddkawaii> yes
[16:45] <frod> I think sony just did two generations worth of r&d with the cell though
[16:45] * Himurosexual has joined #GA
[16:45] <Dcharlie> Dyacks masterpiece spluttering along - 26% done
[16:45] <EviLore> sylvia did show the skills in the nog fight, fedor vs sylvia should be very exciting
[16:45] <TheDarkShinobi> and yeah, ms didn't show much of anything yesterday
[16:45] <TheDarkShinobi> except to that ultra casual/lightweight crowd that's become nintendo's darling now
[16:45] * Himusexual has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[16:45] <EviLore> fedor doesn't let himself take a lot of punishment, though, unlike nog 
[16:46] <MaddenNFL64> The 'power of cell' cachphrase. Do they still say this?
[16:46] <TheDarkShinobi> HEY LOOK, I CAN FILM MYSELF IN A MOVIE!!!....yeah, that'll be exciting for about half an hour
[16:46] <Dcharlie> huh? Gears 2, halo wars, geometry wars 2, ff13, etc... they had enough, for an opening salvo
[16:46] <Dcharlie> they still have stuff left
[16:46] <TheDarkShinobi> I thought it was good enough
[16:46] <EviLore> if fedor thinks that the standup is dangerous for him he'll go straight to the ground explosively
[16:46] <frod> yeah, floor opens later
[16:46] <frod> that was a show
[16:46] <syllogism> did they show halo wars?
[16:46] <TheDarkShinobi> nothing wowzers though
[16:46] <Acosta> no
[16:46] <syllogism> also geowars 2 lol
[16:46] <TheDarkShinobi> then again
[16:46] <Dcharlie> it's just a question of what gets shown here and what gets kept for TGS
[16:46] <Acosta> first half of next year
[16:46] <TheDarkShinobi> I think most conferences are average at best
[16:46] <Dr_EGM92> FINALLY A TRUE SEQUAL TO GALAGA!
[16:46] <Acosta> I think is on schedule for private shows
[16:46] <Unison_> they didnt show Halo Wars, no
[16:47] <FnordChan> Dcharlie:  Microsoft is going to unveil their big Japan exclusives for the 360 at TGS?  The hell?
[16:47] <TheDarkShinobi> you can't win anything with a conference...your main aim is to not lose with the conference
[16:47] <Unison_> bungie must be defecting to multiplatform
[16:47] <TheDarkShinobi> ms looked ridiculous at e3 05
[16:47] <TheDarkShinobi> sony looked LOLZ at e3 06
[16:47] <Unison_> no Halo, but 10 minutes of You're In The Movies
[16:47] <Unison_> lol
[16:47] <MaddenNFL64> Bungie was at EA conference, but nothing. Wonder why.
[16:47] <Acosta> haha
[16:47] <Acosta> I wonder, when they decide to go 10 mins
[16:48] <Kabouter> «15:44:51» {ddkawaii} and carmine AND kim are back < Kim too? wtf? :D
[16:48] <Kabouter> How?!
[16:48] <Acosta> with something that make their execs so ridicule
[16:48] * Visceir has joined #GA
[16:48] <Acosta> what the hell are they thinking?
[16:48] <Dcharlie> 40% come on DD! 
[16:48] <TheDarkShinobi> all those execs just lok embarassing
[16:48] <TheDarkShinobi> the only one with any stage cred is reggie
[16:48] <Unison_> true shin
[16:48] <Unison_> Petah had some
[16:48] <Unison_> honestly
[16:48] <TheDarkShinobi> yeah true
[16:48] <Unison_> Petah was fine on stage
[16:49] <Dcharlie> Robbie B made me want to commit mass murder
[16:49] <TheDarkShinobi> but he's gone now, so ms is left with twats like kim
[16:49] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[16:49] <Dcharlie> Ken Kutaragi was on drugs
[16:49] <MaddenNFL64> All I can say to you DCCharlie, is treat the sword fodder as if you were clicking a mouse cursor over them. And NOT think of it as DMC.
[16:49] <TheDarkShinobi> allard was annoying as hell
[16:49] <MaddenNFL64> cuz it just aint.
[16:49] <Dcharlie> ah
[16:49] <Dr_EGM92> Allard was awesome
[16:50] <Dr_EGM92> he lost so much weight and confronted his hairloss!
[16:50] <Acosta> Miyamoto
[16:50] <Dcharlie> Allard - that Xbot image make over surely resulted in more poon
[16:50] <Dr_EGM92> it takes a true man to do that
[16:50] <TheDarkShinobi> lol
[16:50] <Acosta> no matter what he does
[16:50] <Acosta> people love him
[16:50] <TheDarkShinobi> miyamoto is michael jackson
[16:50] <Acosta> haha
[16:50] <TheDarkShinobi> a 12 year old genius who's never grown up
[16:50] <Dcharlie> i don't think he's touched the kids in the same way 
[16:50] <TheDarkShinobi> only difference is his face doesn't looked fucked up
[16:50] <Dr_EGM92> lol
[16:51] <TheDarkShinobi> I bet miyamoto plays with kids
[16:51] <TheDarkShinobi> seems to be the only people he can relate to
[16:52] <Unison_> lol
[16:52] <Unison_> he is probably a pedo
[16:52] <Unison_> i wouldnt be stunned
[16:52] <MaddenNFL64> I bet Miyamoto is actually pretty normal in real life, but has a screw loose somewhere, and when he wants to, he can think of pikmins, and fat plumbers and shit
[16:53] <TheDarkShinobi> pretty much
[16:53] <frod> read something about him swimming around his office with Shimizu in Edge
[16:53] * JRPereira has left #GA

[16:55] <MaddenNFL64> Fully clothed strippers
[16:55] <TheDarkShinobi> one way or the other
[16:55] <Acosta> I expect Wii Sports 2, youtube

[16:56] <Unison_> they won't do youtube montage again
[16:56] <TheDarkShinobi> I liked that "We Are The Champions" suggestion from someone

[16:56] <Unison_> i hope Electroplankton DJ comes back
[16:56] <TheDarkShinobi> just blare that shit out as they slowly ride out on stage in an open top limo with ticker tape raining down

[16:57] <MaddenNFL64> Regie with a pimp cane
[16:57] <Dcharlie> 15% to go - rubs thighs
[16:57] <Unison_> like 2 years ago
[16:57] <Unison_> remember miyamoto conducting
[16:57] <Darkh23> they should roll yamauchi out of the retirement home to come give a speech
[16:57] <Unison_> lol
[16:57] <FnordChan> Miyamoto, wearing an ermine cloak, will ride a white horse onto the stage.  It'll be like the final episode of Iron Chef.
[16:57] <Acosta> agree Unison
[16:57] <Tre`> this house song is hilarious
[16:57] <Unison_> he's Japan's Mr. Burns

[16:59] <Acosta> EA is getting a killer line
[16:59] <TheDarkShinobi> good to see I'm up to date!
[16:59] <Acosta> is really impressive

[17:18] <atomsk> big money in the trilogy!
[17:18] <atomsk> err... triology
[17:18] <osaka> trilogy*
[17:18] <Unison_> EviLore well, Jade Empire was a franchise too
[17:18] <Unison_> supposedly

[17:19] * avcables has joined #GA
[17:19] <atomsk> i can't wait to play too human 2 in 2018, and then too human 3 in 2028
[17:19] <TheDarkShinobi> haha lore
[17:19] <Kabouter> lol @ EA putting in a flying robot that transforms into a land based one
[17:19] <avcables> too human is so bad :(
[17:19] <impirius> jade empire was going to be a franchise until they realized that they can't possibly top their 9.9 first game
[17:20] <FnordChan> EviLore:  I dunno, I imagine that many studios assume that the only way to really make their money back on a game is to put a lot of work into the first release, then spin-off sequels using the same engine.  Thus, instant franchises all around...at least, they hope so.
[17:20] <impirius> ahahaha... my irc client turns "9.9" into rolleyes
[17:20] <Unison_> haha imp
[17:20] <Unison_> 9.9
[17:20] <FnordChan> impirius:  And mine turns "6.8" into "QQ".
[17:20] <Kabouter> lol, cool
[17:20] <Unison_> i'm sure nintendo's conference will have lots of 9.9 s
[17:20] <impirius> hahahahaha
[17:20] <Kabouter> Japan in Red Alert 3 has a plane that can go underwater

[17:31] <EviLore> "On top of my wife divorcing me. My parents disowning me. And now being stranded almost 2000 miles from home with not enough money to get home, I only have one option left.
[17:31] <EviLore> If anyone lives in Omaha or nearby and hears about I-80 west being slow tomorrow due to a body hit by a truck, you'll know why.

[17:31] <EviLore> haha, oh manabyte, always so dramatic
[17:32] <atomsk> someone give him some good news about disney and he'll be fine
[17:32] <Acosta> actually, it looked like a very shitty situation
[17:32] <Acosta> I still remember reading it
[17:32] * stump has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)

[17:32] <Acosta> everything looked pretty fucked
[17:33] <EviLore> "I don't think anyone here knows what it's like to be disowned by their family and not be able to pick up the phone and get anyone. Then be so much in debt, unemployeed, broke, and stranded thousands of miles from home.

[17:33] <EviLore> "
[17:33] <Unison_> why did his parents disown him?
[17:33] <EviLore> NO ONE FEELS THE PAIN THAT I DO

[17:33] <atomsk> someone give that boy an acoustic guitar, i smell a new emo star
[17:33] <Unison_> this is why you should close OT
[17:33] <Tiduz> Xbox boss Shane Kim gas said that Microsoft have already decided when the Xbox 360 will hit $199 but they are keeping it a secret. All Kim would say is that its some time off and that "$199 is the price point where consoles do the most business."
[17:33] <LoneWork> LET THE FIRE OVERTAKE ME WITH IT'S FURIOUS FEROCITY
[17:33] <Tiduz> 2010 confirmed
[17:34] <FnordChan> EviLore:  Oh, he'll find a way home.  Cue the "Rules of the Road" scene from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.
[17:34] <Unison_> but why did his parents disown him? because he lost his big rig?
[17:34] <LoneWork> don't know, something that happened before I think.
[17:34] <EviLore> no, I think they sided with his ex-wife
[17:34] <EviLore> haha
[17:34] <Unison_> LOL
[17:34] <LoneWork> I was thinking it was that Evil
[17:35] <Tiduz> LOL
[17:35] <Tiduz> Sided with his ex wife
[17:35] <Tiduz> ahahaha
[17:35] <LoneWork> that's some Shakespeare shit right there.  "We'll chose the Fake Daughter over our Real Son"  NEXT TIME ON JERRY!
[17:35] <Unison_> i love that his life is in shambles, he's in the middle of nowhere, and he's contemplating suicide
[17:35] <Unison_> yet still posting on GAF

[17:36] <EviLore> so farewell GAF. this is it

[17:36] <Unison_> lol
[17:36] <FnordChan> For god's sake, Mana, start walkign to the bus station.
[17:36] <Unison_> then he posted again!

[17:37] <LoneWork> bfh is?
[17:37] <Tiduz> Id founder and boss, John Carmack, has been talking about their decision to choose EA as the publisher for 'Rage'. Carmack said that he once thought "EA was the Evil Empire, the company that crushes the small studios". However when deciding on who will publish 'Rage' he heard "almost uniformly positive responses" about EA.
[17:37] <Tiduz> lol
[17:37] <Dcharlie> bus fare home
[17:37] <Unison_> the "farewell GAF" post lasted less than 10 minutes
[17:37] <Unison_> until his next post
[17:37] <LoneWork> k
[17:37] <Unison_> lol
[17:37] <EviLore> haha
[17:37] <Darkh23> as usual there's more to this story than he is letting on
[17:37] <frod> 2000 miles isn't that far. Start walking.
[17:37] <Unison_> duh
[17:38] <Unison_> he probably got fired for something stupid
[17:38] <LoneWork> death, or "rules of the road"...
[17:38] <Darkh23> yeah
[17:38] <Unison_> not for driving after midnight
[17:38] <Darkh23> or he sucked ass at driving and cut off some traffic
[17:38] <Darkh23> and the trainer fired him
[17:38] <MaddenNFL64> The last time, he got kicked out of his house or something?
[17:38] <Unison_> why did his wife divorce him?
[17:38] <EviLore> only about 40 days to get back, walking
[17:38] <Unison_> lol EviLore
[17:39] <Darkh23> he said it was because her family was evil and made him quit his good job adn then she divorced him too
[17:39] <MaddenNFL64> Suicidal tendencies maybe.
[17:39] <Dcharlie> lol
[17:39] <LoneWork> as someone said: Kabayashi Maru
[17:39] <Dcharlie> or the wife didn:t exist
[17:39] * FnordChan is now known as TrekNerd
[17:39] <Acosta> lol Dcharlie
[17:39] <Unison_> haha
[17:39] <TrekNerd> LoneWork:  That's "Kobayashi Maru".
[17:39] * TrekNerd is now known as FnordChan
[17:39] <Unison_> his family sided with his imaginary wife & disowned him
[17:39] <MaddenNFL64> Heh, maybe.
[17:39] <TheDarkShinobi> same shit, different day with manabyte
[17:39] <Tiduz> oh this is rich
[17:39] <Tiduz> MS: we haven't copied Nintendo, Xbox avatars have arms, necks and legs
[17:39] <Dcharlie> "can't be arsed writting about the wife, i'll remove her from my internet personal back story ASAP" 
[17:39] <Acosta> hahaha
[17:39] <LoneWork> hey, it's a copy paste from Dookie "Mah sisters hawt!" not me
[17:39] <TheDarkShinobi> it's a 12 year old soap opera with that clown
[17:40] <stump> Tiduz: yeah i lol'd at that
[17:40] <Darkh23> "I don't think anyone here knows what it's like to be disowned by their family and not be able to pick up the phone and get anyone. Then be so much in debt, unemployeed, broke, and stranded thousands of miles from home.
[17:40] <Darkh23> If there's a better option then stuck between the drive tires of a truck, I'd love to hear it."  oh QQ...haven't heard him say this shit before
[17:40] <Tiduz> :P
[17:40] <MaddenNFL64> His family doesn't exist either. He's actualy a comatose kid connected to internet.
[17:40] <Dcharlie> he's a figment of GAFs imagination
[17:40] <Dcharlie> when i try to show the wife his posts, she can't see them
[17:40] <Darkh23> every time he gets into shit it's never his fault...it's always everyone elses
[17:41] <LoneWork> he might be carrying milk cartons, with pictures of his family members on them.
[17:41] <Darkh23> lol costanza makes a valid point   "What are you even posting from and why the hell haven't you sold it yet?"
[17:41] <TheDarkShinobi> manabyte was online LOOOOOONG before neogaf
[17:41] <Unison_> manabyte = denis dyack! :-o
[17:41] * stump has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[17:41] * stump has joined #GA
[17:41] <TheDarkShinobi> dude was spoiling ff7 in ign's palace chat
[17:41] <TheDarkShinobi> that's how far back he goes
[17:41] <Unison_> lol
[17:41] <Acosta> lol
[17:41] <Darkh23> he was on IGN palace with us?
[17:41] <Unison_> sounds like dyack
[17:42] <MaddenNFL64> So Too Human isn't real either. We as a collective made it up for funnies.
[17:42] <Darkh23> I don't remember him
[17:42] <Darkh23> lol
[17:42] <TheDarkShinobi> yep
[17:42] <TheDarkShinobi> or at least next gen's ign room
[17:42] <Unison_> that would explain Dyack's pathological obsession w/ GAF
[17:42] <Darkh23> all I remember is we'd cruise over from ID's palace to make fun of IGN's lagfest....Sven would get all pissy and we'd cruise on back
[17:42] <Dcharlie> maybe true
[17:42] <TheDarkShinobi> might've turned into ign a year after
[17:42] <Dcharlie> maybe the whole truck thing is a metaphor
[17:42] <MaddenNFL64> It's really our obsession with GAF... BREAKTHROUGH.
[17:42] <TheDarkShinobi> but yeah, mana was a bit of a flake back then
[17:42] <Dcharlie> I JOINED UP WENT FOR THE RIDE, BUT YOU LEFT ME DRY
[17:42] <TheDarkShinobi> it's far worse now though
[17:43] <osaka> what the fuck @ manabyte
[17:43] <atomsk> someone tell him he needs to start arm wrestling to survive
[17:43] <osaka> should i call bullshit on this?
[17:43] <Unison_> yes
[17:43] <Darkh23> he's always full of shit
[17:43] <osaka> i mean wtf he should've done to not get fired?
[17:43] <Darkh23> should trace his IP and see if he is really posting from Omaha
[17:43] <Unison_> haha
[17:43] <TheDarkShinobi> you can call bullshit on basically anything he's said since puberty
[17:43] <osaka> and the way he writes the shit it sounds like the trainer lost his arms and legs and was unable to drive or something
[17:44] <Unison_> i doubt every train is sold out for a week
[17:44] <Unison_> let me check
[17:44] <osaka> how is that even possible
[17:44] <Unison_> where does he live?
[17:44] <Unison_> lol
[17:44] <Darkh23> what idiot doesn't pull over and let the trainer drive "OH NOES THERE IS NOWEHRE TO PULL OVER"
[17:44] <osaka> how can trains be sold out
[17:44] <osaka> what the fuuuck
[17:44] <Unison_> i'll see if i can find him a ticket
[17:44] <frod> maybe he crossed a timezone without realising
[17:44] <Darkh23> lol
[17:44] <Unison_> anyone know where he's from?
[17:45] <Unison_> lol
[17:45] <LoneWork> Darkh: almost sounds like the kids in Supertroopers: "HE CAN'T PULL OVER ANY FARTHER!"
[17:45] <Sea_Manky> Someone post this in manabyte's latest attention whore thread: http://awesomegamerz.com/d/20030616.html
[17:45] <EviLore> he's from california
[17:45] <osaka> should change his tag to "crying wolf, once again"
[17:46] <Unison_> let me check
[17:46] <Darkh23> shit....throw on your 4 way flashers...have a chinese fire drill...and keep on going
[17:46] <Dcharlie> lol - what the train was sold out and he couldn't wait for the next one?
[17:46] <Tre`> wait
[17:46] <Dcharlie> maybe this is some sort of trucker initiation
[17:46] <Tre`> manabyte's whining again
[17:46] <Darkh23> yep
[17:46] <Unison_> oh wow
[17:46] <Unison_> it is sold out
[17:46] <Unison_> lol
[17:46] <Acosta> big surprise, eh?
[17:46] <Darkh23> he's gonna throw himself under a truck soon this time tre
[17:47] <Dcharlie> that's ironic
[17:47] <LoneWork> but not before setting himself on fire
[17:47] <Darkh23> lol
[17:47] <Dcharlie> maybe his trainer will be asleep at the wheel of the unfortunate cab?
[17:47] <LoneWork> and hanging himself with piano wire
[17:47] <LoneWork> and electricuting  himself with a large vibrating dildo
[17:47] <avcables> so is manabyte dead yet or what
[17:48] <MaddenNFL64> Suicidal people are hard to deal with. You don't want to push them, but fuck. You want them to suck it up, and move on. Life isn't great all the fucking time. people go through worse shit then u every day, deal.
[17:48] <MaddenNFL64> But thats insensitive.
[17:48] <LoneWork> he should die, THE AMERICAN WAY
[17:48] <Darkh23> he's cried wolf too many times to be sensitive to him
[17:48] <Darkh23> lol
[17:48] <Nikashi> MaddenNFL64: Talking about PS3 fans?
[17:48] <LoneWork> that is, eat and drink some foul shit throughout life, and develope some form of cancer
[17:48] <ddkawaii> lulz
[17:48] <Kabouter> Just a shocking amount of people are going to buy Too Human on GAF :X
[17:48] <Tiduz> Viacom dropped the thing where they wanted youtube users details :O
[17:48] <MaddenNFL64> :P
[17:48] <Kabouter> Just when I thought my opinion of GAF couldn't get any lower
[17:48] <ddkawaii> eveyone with a brain agrees
[17:49] <ddkawaii> too human is terrible
[17:49] <Kabouter> Yes it is
[17:49] <ddkawaii> if u like too humanz
[17:49] <avcables> <+Tiduz> Viacom dropped the thing where they wanted youtube users details :O <- probably cause they found some viacom employees uploading shit to youtube
[17:49] <ddkawaii> you have no brain
[17:49] <LoneWork> it's so bad, I haven't bother attempting to download it
[17:49] <ddkawaii> themz he facts
[17:49] <Kabouter> Not mediocre like I thought at first, after playing the demo, I know Too Human is complete ass.
[17:49] <avcables> when i played the too humanz demo, i lolz'd so hard at the pause screen menu
[17:49] <Tiduz> avcables hahaha
[17:49] <LoneWork> Mana=Dyack fits though
[17:50] <Dcharlie> i couldnt stand the room heat, but it struck me as being on the lower side of average
[17:50] <Dcharlie> not Two Worlds bad though
[17:50] <MaddenNFL64> Damn, I like Too Human. I can't fight it. I think i'm in bizarro groupthink where I like shit GAF hates.
[17:50] <Acosta> lol
[17:50] <ddkawaii> if you fix the camera and the controls
[17:50] <avcables> the only weapon i liked was the guns that shot a steady laser stream
[17:50] <ddkawaii> it becomes an average game
[17:50] <ddkawaii> instead of a 2
[17:51] <avcables> but the camera and controls break it so bad even those are unfun to use
[17:51] <Acosta> if a MS published games with god knows how much time of development and amount of resources finishes like Two World
[17:51] <Dcharlie> gah, how long to Nintendominance?
[17:51] <Acosta> Dyack can follow Manabyte's path
[17:51] <Unison_> 1 hr
[17:51] <Dcharlie> cant decide whether to sleep or not
[17:51] <Tre`> so
[17:51] <frod> 1:10
[17:51] <Dcharlie> cool - i might have some coffee then
[17:51] <MaddenNFL64> Not saying there aren't problems with it. There are. And it's not GREAT. Not from what the demo showed anyway.
[17:52] <Darkh23> just finished my coffee..I am energized to stay awake through sales powerpointz
[17:52] <Tre`> what's the over/under on the time until Manabyte posts again?
[17:52] <EviLore> he just did
[17:52] <EviLore> "this is my final post ever im logging off the hotel computer and going out to the freeway to jump infront of a semi.
[17:52] <EviLore> my family has disowned me so i cant go home there my wife has divorced me i am completely homless with no way to get back to califonia from where i am.
[17:52] <EviLore> this is my only option goodbye everyone im sorry
[17:52] <EviLore> "
[17:52] <Darkh23> lol
[17:52] <EviLore> and I just responded too
[17:52] <Tre`> oh
[17:52] <Unison_> lol
[17:52] <Tre`> hahaha
[17:52] <Darkh23> AAHAHAHAHA

[17:53] <Darkh23> 1 hour later -- "Well I've been waiting out there for an hour and no fucking semi trucks have come by yet.  I came back inside to get a sandwich"
[17:53] <SnakeXs> Admin powers for the win.
[17:53] <EviLore> sigh, manabyte, cry for attention.
[17:53] <LoneWork> Tre, just get Gaime to do it, give him a +V for it.

[18:00] <Dcharlie> actually - a friend who had an accident got all the queue cutting treatment at Disney 
[18:00] <frod> manabyte will be able to cut queues soon if he survives the 18 wheeler
[18:00] <LoneWork> omg, there are a few spidermen in here...bullshit sense TINGLING
[18:01] <priz> heh
[18:02] <Unison_> god, G4 commercials are hilarious

[18:03] <LoneWork> strange thing is, you live in Montana!
[18:03] <Unison_> haha
[18:03] <sp0rsk> gonna go lay down till the thing starts
[18:03] <priz> so I e-mailed the Japanese office of Marvelous, the US office and the developer seperately saying "Go fix the goddamn bugs in this game before releasing this here. This is sad!"
[18:03] * syllogism has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[18:03] <priz> (I didn't say it like that)
[18:04] <priz> after e-mailing all 3, developer deserving it more than anyone
[18:04] <priz> I see it's NOT Marvelous, it's Natsume bringing it here.
[18:04] <priz> SON OF A
[18:04] <Unison_> haha dyack is on G4 now talking about motion capture
[18:04] <Unison_> when Too Human has the worst animation this gen

[18:09] <LoneWork> Rors, you in time to see GAF push a guy into Suicide!

[18:15] <Unison_> would it matter?
[18:15] <Unison_> lol

[18:15] <Rorschach> to the world?  No
[18:15] <Darkh23> feel sorry for the trucker that hits him and has to live with it

[18:15] <Darkh23> no him
[18:15] <Rorschach> ...well, not really
[18:16] <LoneWork> wonder if we can change the lyrics to "Grandma got run over by a Reindeer" to fit this situation
[18:16] <Tre`> "Damn. so not only was Mana abandoned by his family, he was also abandoned by his mods :("
[18:16] <Darkh23> lol
[18:16] <Tre`> pfft
[18:16] <Darkh23> lol
[18:16] <Unison_> "sorry manabyte, can't deal with your shit today... E3 press conferences & all"

[18:17] <Unison_> i hope he posts a suicide note

[18:17] <Tre`> ohhhhhh
[18:17] <Darkh23> Firewire -->  "If you think Sony has no influence with SE, I think your mistaken. There has always been a great relationship between the companies. And Sony's backing of SE is evident, do you think they just forgot what Sony did in helping to bail them out."

[18:19] <Rorschach> and the time before that
[18:19] <priz> and Mana was Brandon's errand boy
[18:19] <Unison_>  
[18:19] <Unison_> Ok well... the difference is the next Final Fantasy will be a big fucking deal. Is anyone going to be remember Blue Dragon years from now, other than the time Microsoft put out a half assed cookie cutter jRPG? Maybe because Microsoft is releasing so many games they will equal the sales of a single FF, and you can call that a ... victory? or something... Are we all going to be waiting for Lost Odyssey VII some day? I doubt it.
[18:19] <Unison_> lol
[18:19] <priz> it was kinda sad
[18:20] <priz> I actually stood up for Mana and called Brandon a lazy bitch
[18:20] * HitokageLaptop has joined #GA
[18:20] <Acosta> in any case I hope Mana is not serious
[18:20] <Acosta> attention whore and all that
[18:20] <priz> (he was lazy)
[18:20] <Acosta> but I hope he doesn't make something stupid
[18:21] <EviLore> well we'll check the news
[18:21] <LoneWork> make something stupid?  Like a Smokeless Ashtray?

[18:22] * tsef has joined #GA
[18:22] <Rorschach> Nintendo conference will probably be a bore...
[18:22] <Unison_> yeah
[18:22] <EviLore> 40 minutes, tre
[18:23] <avcables> i wish there was a mobile e3 alert page so i could be notified of important things while i was at work :(
[18:23] <Unison_> it will be like
[18:23] <Unison_> animal crossing
[18:23] <Unison_> wii music
[18:23] <Unison_> ONE HARDCORE GAME
[18:23] <Unison_> lol
[18:23] <Acosta> I expect something cool
[18:23] <Rorschach> that cool looking black and white game won't be there
[18:23] <LoneWork> as someone said "Wii Shoveling"
[18:23] <Acosta> with the 1:1
[18:23] <Rorschach> too bloody
[18:23] <FnordChan> avcables:  Depending on where you work, you can probably hear fanboys screaming in disbelief at major announcements.
[18:23] <frod> animal music and wii crossing
[18:23] <Acosta> I wish
[18:23] <Rorschach> not rated E
[18:23] <priz> Evil: "Wow, you're 27? You're OLD! Do you wear Depends? I hope I die before I  reach 21... because I don't want to be that OLD!"
[18:23] <Unison_> 1:1 will probably be used for wii music
[18:23] <Unison_> primarily
[18:23] <frod> wait, ea did animal music yesterday
[18:23] <LoneWork> Mana am suicide over FFXIII
[18:23] <Unison_> Kingdom Hearts would be the most likely megaton
[18:23] <Unison_> for Wii
[18:23] <avcables> i work where the new character models for left4dead shop
[18:24] <Acosta> I agree, but something "hardcore"would be cool
[18:24] <EviLore> priz: did he play counter-strike?  haw
[18:24] <Unison_> maybe a new zelda
[18:24] <Acosta> maybe an examples with a star wars game
[18:24] <Acosta> 1:1 openes a lot of options for combat
[18:24] <Unison_> lol, wii already has 2 star wars games coming
[18:24] <Unison_> they wont show another
[18:24] <EviLore> there are loads of idiots who taunt anyone over 18 in counter-strike
[18:24] <priz> Evil: they did that promo DVD for Metal Gear Solid 1 showing the reactions of the crowd from the Trailer at E3
[18:24] <priz> he was on that
[18:24] <milhouse3> FYI press.nintendo.com The username is E32008 and the password is nintendo
[18:24] <Unison_> if anything Clone Wars will be modified for 1:1
[18:24] <EviLore> ah
[18:24] <Rorschach> don't trust anyone over 19
[18:25] * Himurosexual has joined #GA
[18:25] <Acosta> nah, i was thinking on one of the two star wars in production
[18:25] <Acosta> it could use the 1:1
[18:25] <priz> Evil: that same year they showed off MGS1, he went to a Halloween party and had too much to drink and on the way home hit a tree
[18:25] <Unison_> they both look like shit
[18:25] <Unison_> who cares

[20:18] <ddkawaii> by the press kit
[20:18] <mintywk> spanky: silence!

[20:18] <Sea_Manky> Sony already did, Warhawk was released last August
[20:18] <ddkawaii> someome check!

[20:18] <milhouse3> ddkawaii : what's up with the wiiware stuff ?
[20:18] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> but yeah, as sp0rsk said
[20:18] <Tiduz> WARHAWK SINGLE PLAYER
[20:19] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> this proved 3rd parties still aren't doing shit
[20:19] <Tiduz> if thats announced
[20:19] <impirius> NEOGAF d. NINTENDO, E3 2008
[20:19] <Tiduz> ill hump my ps3
[20:19] * Ed has joined #GA
[20:19] <Sea_Manky> feh, don't care about single player anymore
[20:19] <milhouse3> there is no press kit on the official press site
[20:19] <Tiduz> It looked so awesome, the huge ship
[20:19] <impirius> here comes a new challenger
[20:19] <Tiduz> :o
[20:19] * Kazenone has quit IRC (Client exited)
[20:19] <LoneWork> GAF EXPOLDE

[20:19] <Wario64> of the drummer guy
[20:19] <Tiduz> everyone yesterday saying sony is doomed
[20:19] <Y2Kev> 5000000
[20:19] <jett> this sucked enormous amounts of cack
[20:19] <Tiduz> wonder how much will do a 180
[20:19] <Unison_> sony is still doomed
[20:19] <ddkawaii> i was old gta and wiiware
[20:19] <ddkawaii> for nintendo
[20:19] <Unison_> MS has this shit in a walk
[20:19] <MaddenNFL64> No before go, or one last thing. Nothin. Don't they care about us forum goers, and our megaton gasms?
[20:19] <Unison_> Scoreboard: Nintendo -9999 / Microsoft 1 / Sony -1000
[20:19] <Sea_Manky> It looks like they're going that route anyway, by taking previously created assets and properly balancing them for online
[20:19] <Acosta> god thing I wasn't there
[20:19] <MrPing1000> sony is still doomed probably
[20:19] <jett> sony's doomed forever
[20:19] <ddkawaii> only gta came true
[20:20] <ddkawaii> :-(
[20:20] <Unison_> sony can't make up that deficit
[20:20] <Acosta> I was annoyed enough last year
[20:20] <LoneWork> can't wait till the gif shows up, where everyone has Rave Stick's in their hands
[20:20] <Tiduz> IF it has good games i dont care about first place
[20:20] <MrPing1000> Nintendo win this gen, whether we like it or not
[20:20] * Andvary has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[20:20] <ddkawaii> UNLESS its in the press kit
[20:20] <sp0rsk> the thing is nintendo can have a shitty show like this
[20:20] <Tiduz> as long as i can play good games
[20:20] <sp0rsk> and still be fine
[20:20] * Kazenone has joined #GA
[20:20] <Tiduz> i dont give two shits about anything else
[20:20] <Tiduz> :D
[20:20] <Kabouter> Uhhh sp0rsk

[20:23] <Ed> nah, this is awful
[20:23] <sp0rsk> oh hey
[20:23] <Ed> doesn't sound like they annouced ANYTHING
[20:23] <Unison_> 2003 was better
[20:23] <Unison_> for sure
[20:23] <sp0rsk> rhythm tengoku is coming to the states
[20:23] <Unison_> 2003 had FZero 
[20:23] <Unison_> and Mario Kart
[20:23] <Tiduz> :o
[20:23] <Ed> which I guess they don't really need to annouce anything
[20:23] <MaddenNFL64> Will wright & miyamoto playing pacman was way more interesting then this shit.
[20:23] <Y2Kev> wow
[20:23] <Y2Kev> even the press kit disappoints
[20:23] <MaddenNFL64> Gah.
[20:23] <Sea_Manky> So.... Sony sure is complacent and arrogant being in first place, huh?

[20:26] <Wario64> animal crossing is hardcore?
[20:26] <Sea_Manky> I _wanted_ Sony to succeed, but then I got Warhawk, and now everything else fades in importance.

[20:27] <Tiduz> Sea_Manky: hahaha
[20:27] <Tiduz> Sea_Manky: warhawk is one of best supported games ever, next to burnout

[20:27] <Tiduz> love both of those teams.

[20:27] <FnordChan> Tre:  What, the one curled up fetal in the corner over there?
[20:28] <Tiduz> maybe he got a sip of her drink before performing

[20:28] <Rorschach> it's gonna be tough to top the Nintendo conference
[20:28] <Sea_Manky> Tiduz: Sure, but I've seen too many series get screwed up to put too much faith in that.
[20:28] <Unison_> holy fuck 
[20:28] <Unison_> i can't believe that conference happened
[20:29] <Tiduz> Sea_Manky: have faith
[20:29] <Unison_> haha
[20:29] <MaddenNFL64> The wii is backwards as it is. VOIP on Wii is like omg shit. Even though it's a decade old. Nintendo is slow as fuck.
[20:29] <FnordChan> EGM92:  It's more that GAF is really depressed than merely down.
[20:29] <Sea_Manky> After all they gave Twisted Metal to 989. >XC=====@

[20:29] <atomsk> "sony, who HOPEFULLY have surprises up thier sleeve as well"
[20:29] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> Sony could cancel the conference right now
[20:29] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> and they'd still win
[20:29] <Sea_Manky> Oh, I have faith in Incognito all right, but nothing lasts forever.
[20:29] <milhouse3> nintendo has not madworld pic or pdf on his site. THEY SUCKS
[20:29] <MaddenNFL64> Sony can win this.

[20:29] <MaddenNFL64> WADA needs to be there.
[20:29] <Tre`> I can already tell you what the Sony conference will be
[20:29] <MrPing1000> PC Gaming is the only home of the hardcore, it's the truth, live with it console kids
[20:29] <Magus> so he can announce FF7 remake :O
[20:29] <Tre`> lots of PLAYSTATION FAMILY graphs
[20:29] <jett> if THE WADA is at the sony conf i'll laugh
[20:30] <Tre`> merging PS3, PSP, and PS2 sales against the Nuon or some shit
[20:30] <Magus> tre - sony meteo
[20:30] <EGM92> <+Rorschach> it's gonna be tough to top the Nintendo conference < yes I be Harai coming out on stage, dropping trow and taking a dump on stage then smear it all over the audience would be better than that nintendo conference... in fact that would be better. I hope that happens
[20:30] <Ed> Fuck yeah MrPing
[20:30] <Sea_Manky> Setting aside the pomposity of PC gamers, home computers will never die, so hardcore games will never die.
[20:30] <Tre`> SEE WE'RE ACTUALLY WINNING
[20:30] <Ed> now let's play some PEGGLE
[20:30] <EviLore> yes, it would be better actually

[20:30] <Xren> http://gamevideos.com/video/id/19953
[20:30] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> that was just
[20:30] <Xren> chrono trigger trailer
[20:30] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> fucking awful
[20:30] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> there is not one redeeming quality of that conference
[20:30] <atomsk> SKIP? 
[20:30] <MrPing1000> PC WINS E3 BY JUST EXISTING!
[20:30] <Hitokage> Sea_Manky: the rebirth of mac gaming
[20:31] <Tre`> oh
[20:31] <Tre`> well
[20:31] <Magus> meh pc
[20:31] <Kabouter> PC is dead.
[20:31] <MaddenNFL64> Nintendo doesnt know hwo to do a press conferecne anymore. Why not show off madworld, or damn even that farming sim that looks nice. Pikmin! Nah, wii-moneycreators is all we get.
[20:31] <Hitokage> lolz to be had by all
[20:31] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> And this was an even year!
[20:31] <MrPing1000> the consoles will all get negative points so PC wins
[20:31] <jett> gaime: whut about wave race mii
[20:31] <Kabouter> Magus knows what'su p
[20:31] <jett> lulz
[20:31] <Rorschach> oh please, if that actually happened, you still wouldn't have as many laughs as the nintendo conference
[20:31] <Tre`> PC won E3 with that BITCHING Left 4 Dead presentation
[20:31] <jett> nintendo just killed the wave race franchise
[20:31] <Unison_> hahaa
[20:31] <Rorschach> Nintendo conference > *
[20:31] <Sea_Manky> Hito: If Warhawk will give me some spare time, I'll be part of that! :X
[20:31] <pj> chrono trigger is just a port?
[20:31] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> yeahe pj
[20:31] <Tre`> http://www.gametrailers.com/player/36318.html?type=
[20:31] <Kabouter> L4D was indeed awesome Tre`
[20:31] <Tre`> WATCH THAT SHIT
[20:31] <Tre`> no
[20:31] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> it'll probably be 40 dolalrs too
[20:31] <Tre`> new presentation kab
[20:31] <MaddenNFL64> Yes. with one extra dungeon.
[20:31] <pj> nintendo really has nothing
[20:31] <MaddenNFL64> i think
[20:31] <Tre`> http://www.gametrailers.com/player/36318.html?type=
[20:31] <Kabouter> I've seen it Tre`.
[20:31] <Rorschach> Tre`: is that the EA one?
[20:31] <Tre`> the one with the gas explosion?
[20:31] <Kabouter> Yes
[20:31] <EGM92> Rors, you don't want to be laughing, you want your audiences mouths to be dropped
[20:31] <Tre`> gas station*
[20:32] <Tre`> yes
[20:32] <Tre`> ZOMG
[20:32] <Rorschach> saw it
[20:32] <MaddenNFL64> Oh ya that was the shit. L4D
[20:32] <Rorschach> already did the jaw dropping for it
[20:32] <EviLore> perrin kaplan giving it to kaz hirai with a strap-on while kaz yells out "RIIIIIIIIIIDGE RAAAAAAAAAAAAAACER" climactically would be a definite improvement over the nintendo conference
[20:32] <MrPing1000> it's no coicidence that games have become less complex as development has shifted to consoles primarily. Gone are the days of games being built to push the pc platform, now we have to make do with the level the consoles set when the pc is capable of so much more
[20:32] <EviLore> one can only hope
[20:32] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> O_O EviLore
[20:33] <Rorschach> shit, I wish Nintendo would just have another conference right now
[20:33] <Rorschach> I would skip the sony one
[20:33] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> Haha
[20:33] <bluemax> maybe thats what nintendo needs
[20:33] <fallout> Rorschach: WII MUSIC ENCORE
[20:33] <atomsk> i'm hungry for a slim jim now
[20:33] <Sea_Manky> You want to pound nails into your dick for another hour? XD
[20:33] <bluemax> one conference for non game bullshit
[20:33] <bluemax> one for real games
[20:33] <Sea_Manky> Just go play Wii instead. XD
[20:33] <MaddenNFL64> They would do an ENCORE of this one. but with just Wii music.
[20:33] <Unison_> Ravi Drums
[20:33] <Unison_> LOL
[20:33] <MaddenNFL64> For an hour.
[20:33] <Rorschach> why would I play wii?
[20:33] <Rorschach> don't even own one anyway
[20:34] <sp0rsk> damn gaf is dead like hell
[20:34] <Sea_Manky> ... because you like pounding nails into your dick
[20:34] <Unison_> no self-respect
[20:34] <milhouse3> What are the  chance Nintendo pull a SSBB on us tomorrow ?????
[20:34] <MaddenNFL64> beep beep boop.... MUSIC
[20:34] <Unison_> basically
[20:34] <Sea_Manky> is joke
[20:34] <milhouse3> NONE
[20:34] * Axord has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[20:34] <Kabouter> ....wow. Dude I sometimes speak to on MSN sent a picture of the Jostiband (a band of mentally retarded people) to the main Nintendo PR woman in the Benelux with the message "Wii music.....seriously?"
[20:34] <BossG> it's painful listening to Iwata talk in english
[20:34] <Sea_Manky> milhouse: What did nintendo announce last E3?
[20:34] <Unison_> remember when nintendo dropped that Smash Bros trailer like a day after the conference?
[20:34] <Unison_> that's the big hope now
[20:34] <Unison_> lol
[20:34] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> Believe
[20:34] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> D:
[20:34] <milhouse3> WIIFIT
[20:34] <Sea_Manky> And before that?
[20:34] <fallout> WEDNESDAYTON
[20:34] <kyoriP4> yea mid e3 we might actually see some core games.
[20:35] <milhouse3> and that was fine with me 
[20:35] <Magus> Unison - NO HOPE FOR YOU
[20:35] <MaddenNFL64> Wii Music makes no sense. How would people even get into that? Fake music playing? Ur not even hitting buttons to time anything... im lost.
[20:35] <Rorschach> [10:34] <+BossG> is painfur risteng to Iwata tark in engris [fixed]
[20:35] <kyoriP4> MaddenNFL64: esp with rock/guitar around
[20:35] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> No hope.   No hoooope   *flatlines*
[20:35] <Magus> SOMEBODY SET UP THE WAGGLE
[20:35] <fallout> mid-e3 is usually when you start seeing sleeper hits coming out
[20:35] <Magus> ALL YOUR GAMES ARE BELONG TO US
[20:35] <fallout> but sometimes, you don't even HEAR about them until the week after
[20:35] <MaddenNFL64> is it to just time the notes?
[20:35] <bluemax> meh
[20:35] <fallout> E3 has always been "boring" after the press conferences
[20:35] <MaddenNFL64> make smooth play?
[20:35] <kyoriP4> MaddenNFL64: nto even that.. looks mindless..
[20:35] <MaddenNFL64> i dunni
[20:35] <bluemax> time to run to work before sony starts
[20:35] <Sea_Manky> okay, I'll rephrase the question.  What's the average time nintendo takes between franchise iterations?
[20:35] <Ed> let's just pretend something cool happened
[20:35] <kyoriP4> Sea_Manky: 2-3 years?
[20:35] <kyoriP4> or once a gen
[20:36] <Unison_> Reggie was on G4 saying GTA DS and Animal Crossing should satisfy core gamers 
[20:36] <Unison_> haha
[20:36] <Unison_> ANIMAL CROSSING?!
[20:36] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> ....
[20:36] <Unison_> LOL
[20:36] <EGM92> lol
[20:36] <kyoriP4> i mean i know at this point there prob wont be another smash until the next platform
[20:36] <Sea_Manky> very good.  Now which franchises have been released this gen?
[20:36] <Ed> HOLY SHIT! NINTENDO ANNOUCED METROID DREAD. NEW 2D WIIWARE GAME WITH NEW SPRITEWORK AAAAAAAAAH.
[20:36] <EGM92> Gaime, DO NOT KILL YOURSELF
[20:36] <EGM92> THERE'S STILL HOPE
[20:36] <MaddenNFL64> Ya looks like u can do whatever you want. At least have a mole who yells at you becuase you suck. Nintendo does that sometimes
[20:36] <EGM92> TGS IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER
[20:36] <kyoriP4> Sea_Manky: i think all?
[20:36] <Sea_Manky> right!
[20:36] <MaddenNFL64> Spaceworld
[20:36] <kyoriP4> a 2nd zelda isnt out of the estion tho
[20:36] * bluemax has quit IRC (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)

[20:37] * iapetus is now known as wiiMusicSucks
[20:37] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> er
[20:37] * wiiMusicSucks is now known as iapetus
[20:37] <Unison_> wii music better cost $20
[20:37] <jett> seems 1up.com thinks God of war 3 will be shown
[20:37] * Unison_ sets mode: +v iapetus
[20:37] <BossG> I'm not interested in the wii period...hehe
[20:37] <jett> i'd be content with the new ico game
[20:37] <DMczaf> rors, my sources told me Madden will be at sony's press conference
[20:37] <DMczaf> ITS REAL
[20:37] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a206/GaimeGuy/IS155-036.jpg

[20:37] <Rorschach> LIES
[20:37] <MaddenNFL64> Better be free with a purchase of a mcdonalds value meal
[20:37] <Rorschach> It will be the 360 version lol
[20:37] <DMczaf> hahaha
[20:38] <EviLore> so probably god of war 3 and thrICO, plus lots of sales charts talking about ps3's growth trends
[20:38] <Rorschach> as long as they don't show the buttons...they didn't even show it at the EA conf
[20:38] <MaddenNFL64> PS3 growth!
[20:38] <Rorschach> or the MS one
[20:38] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> EviLore: and the Playstation Family
[20:38] <jman2050> hmm,
[20:38] <Unison_> that still sounds like a sucky show to me
[20:38] <jman2050> I'm surprise
[20:38] <jman2050> surprised
[20:38] <Acosta> the last Sony conference was pretty good
[20:38] <Unison_> God of War 3 plus some Ico shit?
[20:38] <Unison_> blah
[20:38] <Ed> I think Nintendo will annouce tomorrow that they will make no more software for the Wii.
[20:38] <jman2050> no thread about the new Sonic unleashed trailer?
[20:38] <EGM92> UNCHARTED 2
[20:38] <EGM92> please!
[20:38] <EGM92> PLEASE!
[20:38] <Acosta> it was quite focused around games
[20:38] <OrinX> so why iz i half ops again
[20:38] <Tiduz> one hour left
[20:38] <Tiduz> right?
[20:38] <Ed> and just dedicate their company to producing wii fit
[20:39] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> well Ed, it's not like anyone else is making software for the Wii
[20:39] <Acosta> too bad it takes Sony eating crow to achieve that
[20:39] <BossG> link jman?
[20:39] <MrPing1000> lol the wii music press video it's fucking nusery rhymes
[20:39] <Acosta> their conferences were pretty terrible (sales, sales, sales, how awesome we are)
[20:39] <EGM92> What would make sony rule would be a "Oh BTW, here's a ZOE3 and FFXIII demo"
[20:39] * Axord has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[20:39] <MrPing1000> so basically it'll be nintendo music + no copyright stuff
[20:39] <BossG> no matter how old we are, we're just all children
[20:39] <Tiduz> EGM92:
[20:39] <Tiduz> Twisted metal, GT5, God of war 3, FFXIII, ZOE3, TRICO
[20:40] <Tiduz> sony has enough, question is will they show it and take advantage.
[20:40] <MaddenNFL64> ZOE3. Damn. Thats hot.
[20:40] <Magus> i think they should have showed wii music first and ended with wii sports 2
[20:40] <EGM92> Twisted metal is played out
[20:40] <impirius> fuck yeah, just got my 24" monitor in
[20:40] <Magus> it seemed more approriate

[20:41] <Unison_> they are retards
[20:42] <Ed> Animal Crossing looks somewhat interesting
[20:42] <Unison_> nintendo didnt even have a megaton today
[20:42] <Unison_> hilarious
[20:42] <Tre`> Sony should announce playstation 4
[20:42] <Tre`> and just top this shit off
[20:42] <OrinX> if i see ridge racer im turning off the feed!
[20:42] <Ed> but it's not going to have interactive furnature yet again so why bother
[20:42] <Wario64> megaton = WII Music

[20:44] <Magus> you mother fans will suffer forever
[20:44] <Magus> GWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
[20:44] <iapetus> Hmm. Time for a quick nap before Sony set new levels of not-saying-anything-exciting that exceed even MS and Nintendo.
[20:44] <darkh_lunch> so any press releases to save nintendo while Iwas gone?
[20:44] <ddkawaii> A 16-year-old Canadian prisoner weeps during an interrogation that gives the public its first view of an interview at the U.S. prison camp in Guantanamo Bay. At one point Omar Khadr is seen removing his orange prison shirt to show wounds he says he received during tortur
[20:44] <Magus> it's because you have amir0x blessing
[20:44] <Unison_> AS A SWORD
[20:44] <MaddenNFL64> Play Earthbound and dream of blonde hair.
[20:44] <Magus> and nintendo hates amir0x
[20:44] <Rorschach> DMczaf: ...yes...I was here...you were too
[20:44] * darkh_lunch is now known as darkh23
[20:44] <FnordChan> iapetus:  I dunno, Sony's got some stiff competition this year.
[20:44] <DMczaf> i mean, did you read the previews
[20:44] <DMczaf> this thing sounds crazy
[20:44] <Rorschach> oh no
[20:44] <Rorschach> but it does sound crazy
[20:44] <Y2Kev> hey guys
[20:44] <Rorschach> madden weekly updates plz
[20:45] <Y2Kev> remember when they were gonna announce KH3
[20:45] <Y2Kev> for wii
[20:45] <Y2Kev> lol
[20:45] <jett> lulz kev
[20:45] <Unison_> so nintendo doesnt have any 1st party DS games?
[20:45] <darkh23> and kid snoozarus
[20:45] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> Fact:  3rd parties don't support the Wii
[20:45] <Unison_> besides Rhythm Tengoku?
[20:45] <Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS> and Nintendo is busy making Wii Music
[20:45] <WasabiKing> did not know Soul Calibur IV is coming up
[20:45] <Unison_> lol
[20:45] <atomsk> bububububu WAIT FOR TGS
[20:45] <kyoriP4> WasabiKing: end of the month
[20:45] * Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS cries on Unison's shoulder
[20:45] <WasabiKing> no I know
[20:45] <Magus> Gaime - wario ware shake
[20:45] <Magus> -ware
[20:45] <milhouse3> the wii music video from the website is less horible
[20:45] <MaddenNFL64> They didn't talk up Castlevania 2 : Turbo.
[20:45] <Unison_> nintendo doesnt give shit about E3
[20:45] <Magus> too many warioware game :(
[20:45] <Unison_> that much is obvious
[20:45] <WasabiKing> but I did not know it was so soon
[20:46] <OrinX> http://www.onemanga.com/Full_Metal_Alchemist/85/44/
[20:46] <OrinX> shit just hit the fan
[20:46] <milhouse3> probably because you don't see people playing
[20:46] <darkh23> so nintendo's flagshpis this holiday are wii music and animal crossing?
[20:46] <impirius> nintendo e3 conferences are now just obviously for mainstream press
[20:46] <Tre`> Nintendo doesn't give a shit about core gamers
[20:46] <MrPing1000> and ubisoft's snowboarding carrot top game!
[20:46] <Kabouter> Would you Tre`?
[20:46] <Kabouter> Seriously
[20:46] <Tre`> you bitches don't generate enough revenue
[20:46] <MrPing1000> which I thought was the most interesting game they showed :/
[20:46] <MaddenNFL64> They care about E3 for one thing. Sap stories in the NY times.
[20:46] <Kabouter> I wouldn't give a toss about core gamers if I was Nintendo
[20:46] <impirius> a couple of years ago they didn't even show some games until the second day :-/
[20:46] <Kabouter> Even if only for the fact
[20:46] <Kabouter> That whatever Nintendo does
[20:46] <Magus> BILLIONS
[20:46] <Kabouter> No matter how little they cater to them
[20:46] * SuperSic has joined #GA
[20:47] <Kabouter> Teh core fans will still buy their products
[20:47] <Kabouter> People like Magus
[20:47] <MaddenNFL64> Oh snap.
[20:47] <Magus> me?
[20:47] <Magus> i had a ps2 the last time
[20:47] <milhouse3> the snowboard game wi the balance board look fine. Hope its good
[20:47] <sp0rsk> so sony starts in like 13 minutes?
[20:47] <Kabouter> I'm just hatin' Magus :P
[20:47] <Magus> got a gamecube when it was ultra cheap and old
[20:47] <Magus> :P
[20:47] <Sea_Manky> okay, think I will watch the sony conference, what's the best stream?
[20:47] <Y2Kev> wii discussion should be moved to off topic
[20:47] <Kabouter> Chance of Warhawk is slim to none
[20:47] <sp0rsk> gamespot is the best, but i dont have a link
[20:47] <darkh23> gamespot has been best every time
[20:47] <Rorschach> LOL
[20:47] <iapetus> FnordChan: I have faith in them. They can go above and beyond, especially with an announcement that Home has been delayed, no new games and some weak sales talk.
[20:47] <Sea_Manky> Y2K: I've been advocating a separate nintendo forum for years
[20:47] <MrPing1000> whats the username and pword for nintendo's press site??!?
[20:48] <Magus> ehy! i don't want to see "how to get laid" topic when i want to enter my chocobo dungeon thread :/
[20:48] <jett> sp0rsk: no, 45 minutes
[20:48] <sp0rsk> 45 minutes
[20:48] <milhouse3> The username is E32008 and the password is nintendo.
[20:48] <sp0rsk> fuck im gonna go to bed then
[20:48] <Magus> what's the link milhouse?
[20:48] * WasabiKing sets mode: +b *!*@wtf.bbq
[20:48] <Sea_Manky> Kab: My son won't let me play warhawk since he refuses to get his poopy diaper out of the way, so I might as well. :P
[20:48] * Wes_ has quit IRC (Quit: )
[20:48] <MrPing1000> doesn't appear to work Milhouse
[20:48] <Kabouter> Haha
[20:48] * Gaime-SuperWaggleFAILS was kicked by WasabiKing (ONCE AGAIN, FUCK YOU)
[20:49] <MrPing1000> oh it does
[20:49] <Rorschach> awkward silence
[20:49] <MrPing1000> capital E
[20:49] <Magus> so sony conference is in 45 minutes?
[20:49] * Andvary has quit IRC (Quit: )
[20:49] <Magus> i thought it was going to be an hour after the nintendo one
[20:49] <Rorschach> 40

[20:49] <Rorschach> if you can watch it
[20:49] * HadesGigas has joined #GA
[20:49] <darkh23> alright time to go see how Alkaline is putting a postitive spin on the nintendo conference
[20:49] <Rorschach> I dunno how you can after the Nintendo one
[20:49] <Y2Kev> lol
[20:49] <Rorschach> everything else will be so boring
[20:49] <Y2Kev> that is demoralizing for gamers
[20:50] <jett> ALL ACCORDING TO KEIKAKU
[20:50] <Sea_Manky> "We have a game!  How can hardcore gamers feel left out?"
[20:50] <MaddenNFL64> Only way it'll get saved is if Snake is in Wii Music, and he tells you to not play it.
[20:50] <Ed> Heavy Weapons Guy is the next TF2 class to recieve upgrades, huh
[20:50] <WasabiKing> someone put up a link of the full conference for me later
[20:50] <WasabiKing> lol
[20:50] <Amir0x> http://members.shaw.ca/nervx/wiifail.jpg
[20:50] <Amir0x> hahha
[20:50] <Y2Kev> haha
[20:51] <Magus> i bet he picked it up out of the trash after the photo......
[20:51] <Magus> .... and sold it to ebay for big bucks :P
[20:51] <Amir0x> i bet so too
[20:51] <MaddenNFL64> Then he hugged it.
[20:51] <Ed> and kissed it
[20:51] * EviLore changes topic to 'http://members.shaw.ca/nervx/wiifail.jpg'
[20:51] <MaddenNFL64> lmao
[20:51] <Amir0x> i mean
[20:51] <MrPing1000> and stuck his penis in it
[20:51] <impirius> i'll bet his little sister got it out of her trash can and hooked it up
[20:51] <jett> http://i38.tinypic.com/2egehrs.gif an oldie but a goodie
[20:51] <Sea_Manky> Dreamcaster used to do that kind of thing with his gamecube, he kept taking pics of it in his trash bin
[20:51] <Amir0x> I am still astonished at Wii Music
[20:51] <Rorschach> FUCK IT
[20:51] <Ed> right into the sd card lot mr. ping
[20:51] <Rorschach> WE'LL DO IT LIVE
[20:51] <Amir0x> No matter what you do, Wii
[20:51] <Amir0x> Music automatically transforms your improv stylings into great music. There are
[20:51] <Amir0x> no mistakes—just playing for the pure joy of playing. 
[20:51] <Rorschach> FUCKING THING SUCKS
[20:51] <Amir0x> They are literally making a music game
[20:51] <Amir0x> with NO MISTAKES
[20:51] <Amir0x> it's genius
[20:51] <Magus> but there are lessons amir0x
[20:52] <Magus> lessons!
[20:52] <MaddenNFL64> When Miyamotos translator said that shit... PRETEND?
[20:52] <MaddenNFL64> wtf
[20:52] <impirius> i'm not sure they were playing No Mistakes Mode during the conference
[20:52] <impirius> because it sounded fairly awful
[20:52] <Ed> I want to see a Punk Rock concert album called "FUCK IT. WE'LL DO IT LIVE!"
[20:52] <Rorschach> [10:51] <@Amir0x> I am still astonished at Wii Music [See...even Amir0x agrees]
[20:52] <Rorschach> best conference
[20:52] <Rorschach> EVER
[20:52] <Magus> bah seriously though it was like this last time too
[20:52] <Rorschach> Ed: and inside there's no disc...just a pair of tickets to the show
[20:52] <Magus> and people cried the last time too
[20:52] <Sea_Manky> impirius: They're just trying to give people a taste of what it's like to be nintendo.  You can fuck up royally and people will still give you credit for it. XD
[20:52] <impirius> ahahahahaha
[20:53] <Rorschach> Nintendo :bow
[20:53] <Ed> that's totally punk rock rosch
[20:53] <Rorschach> best conference since pacman
[20:53] <atomsk> after the MS press con it's like "well i need at least 6 of these games", and after the nintendo is like "well... i may rent... one of these...maybe"
[20:53] <stump> 43.9 meg asset pack for populous ds
[20:54] <Amir0x> oh shit
[20:54] <Ed> did Sony have their conference yet?
[20:54] <Sea_Manky> so, is the G4 stream a good one?
[20:54] <Rorschach> no
[20:54] <Magus> 35 minutes
[20:54] <Amir0x> Game CenterX is coming to the US 
[20:54] <Y2Kev> http://i38.tinypic.com/2zdzyv7.jpg

[20:54] <Amir0x> wooo
[20:54] <stump> errr 35?
[20:54] <Rorschach> no sea
[20:54] * Magus slaps Amir0x around a bit with a large trout
[20:54] <stump> Amir0x: yeah that was announced last week. pretty sweet.
[20:54] <ddkawaii> almost time for sony domination
[20:54] <MaddenNFL64> 45 meg cart?
[20:54] <Magus> that game is awesome don't you dare to touch it :(
[20:54] <Rorschach> Sea_Manky: GS
[20:54] <Sea_Manky> Which site has a good stream?
[20:54] <FnordChan> Amir0x:  That's totally awesome.
[20:54] <Sea_Manky> ah, thx
[20:54] <Amir0x> stump: I missed out on it
[20:54] * ddkawaii is in bed
[20:54] <Amir0x> i had a discussion like a few weeks ago about how i could never get excited for it due to moon language
[20:54] * ddkawaii is in his underwear enjoying the rampant fanboyism
[20:54] <Amir0x> it's neat that it's coming
[20:55] <Rorschach> Sea_Manky: best quality is ign, but you have to install an app AND it's delayed 5 mins
[20:55] <FnordChan> ddk: Ewww.

[20:55] <darkh23> 2:30

[20:55] <Magus> amir0x - well i can tell you there is a part of the game you would absolutely hate
[20:55] <Magus> can i spoil it to you?
[20:55] <Sea_Manky> As long as I can tell what I'm looking at and it doesn't stutter, I'm good
[20:55] <Amir0x> go ahead
[20:55] <ddkawaii> fnchan - my balls aren't hanging out so im straight
[20:56] <Rorschach> [10:54] <+Y2Kev> http://i38.tinypic.com/2zdzyv7.jpg so awesome
[20:56] <FnordChan> ddk: We'll let it slide this once, then.

[20:59] <MaddenNFL64> So was Shaun White this years Chewbacca?
[20:59] <Unison_> i've had blind faith in wii so far
[20:59] <Unison_> and i just dont see wii music connecting with people in the USA
[20:59] <Rorschach> haha sea
[20:59] <Unison_> when they could get Guitar Hero / Rock Band
[20:59] <Yann> wii music just makes no sense
[20:59] <Tiduz> No mario no sale.
[20:59] <EviLore> yep
[20:59] <Sea_Manky> Yann: It makes PERFECT sense.
[20:59] <EviLore> ANYONE can play guitar hero or rock band on the lowest settings
[20:59] <DMczaf> it has wii in the title, its going to sell 2 million at least in america
[20:59] <MaddenNFL64> With anyone. It requires nothing of you. it's like... plastic keys for babies.
[20:59] <Sea_Manky> You people just don't see what nintendo is doing.
[20:59] * syllogism has joined #GA
[21:00] <Unison_> i mean do casuals want to play videogame music?
[21:00] <Magus> maybe as a party music game?
[21:00] <Y2Kev> oh come on guys
[21:00] <Y2Kev> and who would buy wii fit
[21:00] <Y2Kev> when they could get a dumbbell
[21:00] <Tiduz> RB2 even has a no fail mode
[21:00] <Y2Kev> nintendo will market this shit to high heaven
[21:00] <Y2Kev> it will be on ellen
[21:00] <Y2Kev> oprah
[21:00] <Tiduz> Nintendo one upped them
[21:00] <EviLore> well, women are afraid of weights
[21:00] <Y2Kev> riki lake
[21:00] <Tiduz> auto gameplay.
[21:00] <Magus> maybe just so they can play a music game where you don't need to be an octopus? :P
[21:00] <Unison_> i predicted wii fit would be huge
[21:00] <Sea_Manky> Y2Kev gets it
[21:00] <EviLore> women are not afraid of guitar hero and rock band
[21:00] <Unison_> but wii music will be a disappointment
[21:00] <EviLore> ;b
[21:00] <Y2Kev> game quality does not matter
[21:00] <Y2Kev> marketing does
[21:00] <Unison_> mark my words
[21:00] <DMczaf> Favre: I don't feel welcome
[21:00] <DMczaf> For the first time since the rumors of his return, retired QB Brett Favre tells the world how he feels.
[21:00] <Unison_> it will probably sell in japan
[21:00] <DMczaf> haha yahoo's top story
[21:00] <DMczaf> poor Favre :(
[21:00] <Sea_Manky> Nintendo is training a market of consumers
[21:00] <Unison_> but i dont think it will outsellf GH in the USA
[21:00] <Tiduz> if sony doesnt kill it its just over for gaming as we know it.
[21:00] <MaddenNFL64> To bomb pearl harbor>
[21:01] <Tiduz> and if they announce waggle ill just play my old games and never buy one again.
[21:01] <Sea_Manky> Eventually that lab rat that pushes a button to get a pellet is going to be laughing at nintendo fans because at least he's getting a pellet.
[21:01] * Andvary has joined #GA
[21:01] <Unison_> sony having waggle would be more fail than megaton
[21:01] <ddkawaii> ?Brett Favre finally is speaking for himself: He wants to play but doesn?t feel welcome in Green Bay, so he?s asking to be released.

[21:02] <Unison_> Wii Music -- "play" midi songs by mashing buttons & waving randomly
[21:02] <Unison_> lol great thread topic
[21:02] <WasabiKing> I would demand a trade if that happens

[21:03] <ddkawaii> why dont they just release favre?
[21:03] <Unison_> is anyone defending nintendo on GAF?
[21:03] <WasabiKing> look man, how can you play when the instant you start fucking up they're going to go with favre
[21:03] <ddkawaii> i dont get it
[21:03] <ddkawaii> haha
[21:03] <MaddenNFL64> Tade him to the Niners. We need help.
[21:03] <EviLore> with an atlas shrugged avatar, no less
[21:03] <Unison_> haha
[21:03] <WasabiKing> cause they don't want him to go to the bears or vikings
[21:03] <ddkawaii> its not like they can win with favre
[21:03] <Unison_> ban anyone who defends that conference
[21:03] <Unison_> seriously
[21:03] <Tiduz> that post is so stupid EviLore
[21:03] <Unison_> i am N-Tard of the highest order
[21:03] <Unison_> you have my blessing
[21:03] <Tiduz> DONT PLAY COD, SHOOT PEOPLE ON THE STREETS WITH A REAL GUN INSTEAD!
[21:03] <Tiduz> Dont play burnout, do it irl!
[21:04] <Yann> 08 lineup is so weak for now, there is bound to be more at some point =/
[21:04] <Yann> wii lineup of course
[21:04] <Sea_Manky> To be fair, you can't shoot people or drive recklessly without serious consequences in real life.  You can, however, pick up a damn guitar. :P
[21:04] <Unison_> yeah
[21:04] <Unison_> there obviously will be more announced later
[21:04] <MaddenNFL64> I'm a Nintendo guy as well. Who gives a shit about defending when shit is oh so wrong. THat conference wasnt for me at all, I can tell that much.
[21:04] <Rorschach> Morgan Webb: So Reggie what do you have to say to harcore gamers who might feel left out by you at this point?
[21:04] <Tiduz> Sea_Manky: but the point is games are for enjoyment
[21:04] <Rorschach> Reggie: How can you possibly feel left out. We've got Animal Crossing with voice chat fully hooked up the internet, and Grand Theft Auto on the DS, so how can you possibly feel left out?
[21:04] <Unison_> the big DS announcement was Pokemon Ranger 2
[21:04] <Unison_> LOL
[21:04] <Rorschach> LOL
[21:04] <Rorschach> reggie gets it!
[21:04] <Rorschach> nintendo gets it
[21:04] <Amir0x> I am so curious to see what they try with Grand Theft Auto DS
[21:05] <Amir0x> if they try to make it full 3D LOLOL
[21:05] <MaddenNFL64> Reggie, you somebitch
[21:05] <Amir0x> but it'll be top down
[21:05] <Amir0x> probably

[21:05] <FnordChan> Reggie:  Come back to me, baby.  You know I don't really mean to hit you.  This time it'll be better, I promise.
[21:05] <Tiduz> wow
[21:05] <OrinX> if the zombies in the near future uprising are like the zombies in 28 weeks later, we are fucked
[21:05] <impirius> GTA DS will be 3D like Shadowgate

[21:06] <Rorschach> gta 2d would be nice
[21:06] <Tiduz> *cancels*

[21:06] <MaddenNFL64> Where the fuck was Pikmin is all im saying. Does it even exist? Have I made my own world up where Pikmin 3 exists? I'm playing it right now.
[21:06] <Magus> mep nobody cared about gta when it was 2D with a topdown visual

[21:06] <Sea_Manky> Predictions for next year's E3: Nintendo announces a GPS add on for the wiimote, also announces Wii Knit, with downloadable crochet patterns!
[21:06] <Rorschach> I did
[21:06] <Rorschach> asshole
[21:06] <Amir0x> Rayne.S says GTA Chinatown is top down 3D
[21:06] <Amir0x> so there's that
[21:06] * Unison_ sets mode: +v HitokageLaptop
[21:06] <Rorschach> and it sold well enough to get plenty of sequels
[21:07] <Magus> Rorschach - i mean nobody as in not 3 million people
[21:07] <Rorschach> Amir0x: might not look so horrid...sucks, though...psp is better fit to handle gta games
[21:07] <Unison_> Wii Sports 2 = next spring
[21:07] <Unison_> so basically wii sucks for another year
[21:07] <Ed> and the psp got 2 gta games
[21:07] <Unison_> lol
[21:07] <Ed> and they didn't sell
[21:07] <Ed> so fuck that idea in the arse
[21:07] <MaddenNFL64> Wii-Something will be perpetual.
[21:08] <Unison_> GTA is a franchise in decline
[21:08] <Ed> agreed
[21:08] <impirius> life is complicated
[21:08] <MaddenNFL64> sales slip, Wii-grape farming.

[21:10] <Tiduz> Sony bought capcom

[21:12] <Rorschach> yeah, first 30 mins will be charts
[21:12] <Sea_Manky> FUCK YOU SONY
[21:12] <bluemax_work> thanks for the warm up manky
[21:12] <Sea_Manky> no prob! :D
[21:12] <BossG> that's real customer service
[21:12] <Magus> uh?
[21:12] <MaddenNFL64> Gamespot is liiive
[21:12] <Magus> did sony conference start?
[21:12] <atomsk> sony needs to come out and go "THE HIGH DEF WAR... IS OVER"
[21:12] <impirius> question: why would sony show charts?
[21:12] <Sea_Manky> DID THE NINTENDO CONFERENCE START YET?!??!?!
[21:13] <MaddenNFL64> Oo
[21:13] <bluemax_work> playstation family impirius
[21:13] <Sea_Manky> DID THEY MAKE ZELDA?!?!!?
[21:13] <Y2Kev> gamespot stream live
[21:13] <impirius> oh yeah
[21:13] <MaddenNFL64> Zelda music
[21:13] <BossG> sony will wait until Nintendo is done
[21:13] <Y2Kev> metal gear music
[21:13] <Rorschach> impirius: you can make data say anything you want 100% of the time with a 50% chance of error 20% of the time
[21:13] <Tiduz> wat?
[21:13] <Sea_Manky> yeah, sony's still making bank off PSX2
[21:13] <Tiduz> i see 15 mins at gamespot
[21:13] <MaddenNFL64> I hear guns
[21:13] <MaddenNFL64> And its lovely
[21:13] <impirius> as you can see the PlayStation Family has been barely outselling Game Boy Advance over the last month and a half!
[21:13] <Sea_Manky> They've fucked up this gen, but they aren't going anywhere
[21:13] <MaddenNFL64> MGS4
[21:13] <Unison_> imp, can you defend that conference at all?
[21:13] <impirius> ros: i agree 110%
[21:13] <Y2Kev> Metal gear music
[21:13] <Unison_> being a nintendo sympathizer
[21:14] <impirius> hmmmmmmmmmmmm
[21:14] <Tre`> there's no way to defend that conference
[21:14] <Magus> as i said i think showing wii music at the end was bad
[21:14] <Tre`> UNLESS
[21:14] <Tre`> you own nintendo stock
[21:14] <Magus> nobody cared about ubicrap
[21:14] <Unison_> i cant think of any Tre`
[21:14] <Magus> i liked wii sports 2
[21:14] <Tre`> or work at nintendo
[21:14] <Unison_> lol
[21:14] <Magus> that's about it
[21:14] <impirius> well, i didn't get raped in the ass by an office intruder while watching it
[21:14] <Unison_> wii sports 2 looked fine
[21:14] <impirius> so 10 points for that
[21:14] <bluemax_work> i hear race car sounds
[21:14] <Tre`> then you're probably doing backflips
[21:14] <bluemax_work> sony to show gran turismo
[21:14] <Tre`> bluemax:  well duh
[21:14] <Rorschach> gahiggidy and I think it's the best conference in years
[21:14] <Unison_> but it's going to be $50
[21:14] <Unison_> for that shit
[21:14] <BossG> heh, I feel the same way abuot allt he conferences though...all show games I don't care about, or would care about
[21:14] <Tre`> another 30 minute Gran Turismo showing
[21:15] <impirius> the streaming video quality was more consistent than MS's
[21:15] <Unison_> haha
[21:15] <Magus> oh god no :S
[21:15] <Rorschach> not since the pacman unveiling nintendo conference
[21:15] <Sea_Manky> showing wii music at the end was perfect, it's just the kind of megahit that nintendo's audience lusts for.
[21:15] <Rorschach> has there been anything so good
[21:15] <Magus> gran turismo <<<<<<<<<<< anything
[21:15] <bluemax_work> metal gear
[21:15] <Rorschach> NOT SINCE VELOCITY GIRL 
[21:15] <bluemax_work> "this is hq"
[21:15] <bluemax_work> "sending reinforcements
[21:15] <bluemax_work> "
[21:15] <OrinX> has it been 20 min yet!
[21:15] <MaddenNFL64> Animal Crossing looks like a nice step in the franchise... 1:1 has potential. The rest of it. Nah. Shit.
[21:15] <bluemax_work> sony needs some damn reinforcements
[21:15] <Unison_> AC looks almost identical
[21:15] <Unison_> lol
[21:15] <Unison_> i mean seriously
[21:15] <MaddenNFL64> And that wiimusic thing was
[21:15] <impirius> AC:DS:Wii
[21:15] <MaddenNFL64> Bomb city
[21:15] <Unison_> at least it's more multiplayer
[21:16] <Unison_> but yeah
[21:16] <Magus> Sea_Manky - have you read malstrom article? the one were they say the reason other casual game don't sell because they are made for retard?
[21:16] <Magus> wii music looks like made for retard
[21:16] <bluemax_work> AC:64:GC:DS:Wii
[21:16] <Unison_> i will probably get AC >_<
[21:16] <impirius> the room microphone looked potentially very cool
[21:16] <bluemax_work> it hasn't improved
[21:16] <Amir0x> minus_273: yes becasue a fisher price guitar with colored buttons is really more realistic then an imaginary one.
[21:16] <Amir0x> WOW
[21:16] <Sea_Manky> everyone's faith in 1:1 is almost as cute as everyone's faith in waggle when it was first announced. :X
[21:16] <jett> we're getting close to failton
[21:16] <Magus> well i don't see what's bad about 1:1
[21:16] <stump> Game fuckin' Center CX is going to be my game of the fall.
[21:16] <jett> 1:1 motion control could bring interesting things to gaming
[21:17] <Rorschach> best part of nintendo conference was when Reggie called you all "fags"
[21:17] <jett> but nintendo won't be the ones doing it
[21:17] <jett> nor will third parties
[21:17] <jett> so it's a stillborn
[21:17] <Amir0x> <Sea_Manky> everyone's faith in 1:1 is almost as cute as everyone's faith in waggle when it was first announced. :X
[21:17] <Y2Kev> kendo looks cool
[21:17] <MaddenNFL64> Miyamoto probably testing how far he can take this. Wants to see when people go "WTF this is too dumb for babies. FU".
[21:17] <Sea_Manky> There's nothing _bad_ about it, but it's merely a refinement of a control scheme that already should have had its potential exploited, but hasn't.
[21:17] * Renzer has joined #GA
[21:17] <Amir0x> My favorite part of 1:1 motion
[21:17] <Y2Kev> even though you really need resistance
[21:17] <WasabiKing> WHAT
[21:17] <Amir0x> is it is basically explicit admittance by Nintendo
[21:17] <Amir0x> that their wiimote is insufficient
[21:17] <Amir0x> that it's a broken, flawed finnicky device
[21:17] <MaddenNFL64> to throw frisbees
[21:17] <Amir0x> and their fans still won't just admit it
[21:17] <Magus> well if they didn't made the wii on 2006 they wouldn't be here today
[21:17] <stump> in the same sense that the ps3 was an explicit admittance by Sony that the PS2 was insufficient, yes?
[21:18] <LoneWork> back from lunch, has anything happened to Sony or Manabyte yet?
[21:18] <Tiduz> let them announce new burnout with old style
[21:18] <Unison_> Amir0x, and it basically says wii controls will suck until next spring
[21:18] <Unison_> lol
[21:18] <Sea_Manky> Ami: Nah, I don't buy that.  The problem with waggle wasn't that it wasn't accurate enough, it was that it's just not suitable for some things.
[21:18] <Tiduz> ps3 excluisve
[21:18] <Magus> new tech doesn't gets made so we people can fap about power
[21:18] <Tiduz> DO IT DO IT DO IT
[21:18] <Magus> it's made to give people more
[21:18] <stump> I don't think it's unrealistic to say that retailers ought to be able to launch improvements to their products by introducing new tech.

[21:18] <Sea_Manky> LIKE GAMES LOL CWUTIDIDTHAR
[21:18] <MaddenNFL64> I'll admit, it is an admission of "our wiimote doesnt do everything we  promised". But i dont think they give a shit. They're pretty much gangsta this gen. dont give a fuck.
[21:18] <Amir0x> <Sea_Manky> Ami: Nah, I don't buy that.  The problem with waggle wasn't that it wasn't accurate enough, it was that it's just not suitable for some things.
[21:18] <Amir0x> Not true.
[21:19] <Amir0x> It's that the thing simply is not good at detecting motions
[21:19] <Kabouter> «20:16:08» {%Unison_} i will probably get AC >_< < See, typical Nintendo whore. Hates shit, but will buy it anyway ;)
[21:19] <BossG> gangsta is the only way to do business
[21:19] <Amir0x> it is give or take
[21:19] <Sea_Manky> stump: Not arguing with that at all.  It's everyone jizzing over it. :P

[21:19] <Amir0x> sometimes it doesn't
[21:19] <Amir0x> gestures are finnicky
[21:19] <Amir0x> so they have to fix it
[21:19] <Amir0x> this is their answer
[21:19] * HitokageLaptop has joined #GA
[21:19] <Magus> mep never had a problem with wiimotes
[21:19] <BossG> step on the hardcore, manipulate and milk the masses for every dollar that they have
[21:19] <Magus> and you are saying it like it's gonna be a requisite of every waggle game
[21:19] <stump> I've never had a problem with wiimotes in any game that didn't suck.
[21:19] <Sea_Manky> Well, I'll stipulate that, and we can do a repeat of two years ago with me in the skeptic column again, and see how it turns out this time. XD
[21:20] <Amir0x> It should be Magus, because their current wiimote sucks for every genre
[21:20] <Tiduz> Samba de Amigo DLC announced
[21:20] <Amir0x> except niche shit like Boom Blox
[21:20] <Tiduz> DLC :o
[21:20] <Tiduz> Samba de Amigo DLC announced
[21:20] <Tiduz> oops
[21:20] <Tiduz> sorry
[21:20] <Magus> well as i said i think the wiimote is fine
[21:20] <Tiduz> MUSIC
[21:20] <Tiduz> !!!!!1
[21:20] <Y2Kev> 10 min!
[21:20] <stump> duhh
[21:20] <Yann> to think animal crossing is the most "hardcore" they have shown...
[21:20] <MaddenNFL64> gestures have to use proccessing power, and guess if your retard O you made was an O or a F.
[21:20] <Tiduz> New Kirby Super Star Ultra Footage/Info
[21:20] <Tiduz> NEW KIRBY?
[21:20] <Amir0x> well Magus it's bad and you should feel bad
[21:20] <Tiduz> NEW KIRBY OMG
[21:20] <Sea_Manky> bah, sony's conference fucking sucks
[21:20] <BossG> not sure how DLC can be avoided...music companies want them dollars
[21:20] <Sea_Manky> they had awesome 80's music last time
[21:20] <Magus> it's not new tiduz
[21:20] <stump> Tiduz: it's kirby superstar on the ds you fooll
[21:20] <Sea_Manky> megafail
[21:20] <Magus> it's a remake of the snes one
[21:20] <Tiduz> oh :(
[21:20] <MaddenNFL64> designers in general are too lazy to deal with that. And nintendo didnt provide shit to help with that
[21:20] <Magus> mind you the snes kirby is the most awesome kirby of all
[21:20] <BJ-502FEETBIATCH> And Animal Crossing itself is a non-game. Oh well, I can understand them using the press conference for the most casual shit
[21:21] <Tiduz>  Four Resident Evil 5 direct feed gameplay videos
[21:21] <WasabiKing> lol So GLAAD is going to file a complaint
[21:21] * BJ-502FEETBIATCH is now known as BJ55
[21:21] <MrPing1000> I wonder if the animal crossing developers ever get board of making the same fucking game again
[21:21] <BossG> hehe, they paid some lipservice to those who worry about NIntendo's casual bent...but then showned nothing for them

[21:21] <WasabiKing> Animal Crossing is a Sims for furries
[21:21] <WasabiKing> but it's still a game
[21:21] <Tiduz> http://www.gametrailers.com/player/36316.html
[21:21] <Magus> why people are excited for infamous?
[21:21] <Magus> the last two sucker punch games sucked
[21:21] <Tiduz> BEcause it rules?
[21:21] <MaddenNFL64> But theres no animal sex, so its not exciting for them
[21:21] <bluemax_work> because they need something to be excited for
[21:22] <WasabiKing> superhero open-world game
[21:22] <Tiduz> Seriously, Magus is suchs a debbie downer

[21:26] <impirius> ultra violent mini-games
[21:26] <Rorschach> bombcast = pure, unadulterated SHIT
[21:26] <WasabiKing> and then now you guys are all over their bandwidth
[21:26] <Sea_Manky> I just want a glimpse of the new warhawk vehicle in the next expansion, don't care about anything else really
[21:26] <BossG> lol wasbi, I cheered when fat boy got canned

[21:26] <impirius> MINI-GAMES
[21:26] <bluemax_work> gamespot has the best feed :(
[21:26] <WasabiKing> hypocrites!
[21:26] <Rorschach> the firing was just coincidental
[21:26] <bluemax_work> and i never said i was boycotting gamespot
[21:26] <bluemax_work> i hate all games journalists equally
[21:26] <Rorschach> gertsman has sucked for over a decade
[21:26] <MaddenNFL64> Well he got fired for bullshit. Never forget baby. Gamespots owners are fucking douchebags.
[21:26] <Magus> It’s easy to play improv jams. Musicians in your band jam by simply playing their
[21:26] <Magus> instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to their heart’s content. Play
[21:26] <Magus> faster. Play slower. Skip a beat, or throw in 10 more. No matter what you do, Wii
[21:26] <Magus> Music automatically transforms your improv stylings into great music. There are
[21:26] <Magus> no mistakes—just playing for the pure joy of playing. 
[21:27] <Rorschach> wtf magus
[21:27] <Tiduz> ?
[21:27] <MaddenNFL64> But i like their feed
[21:27] <LoneWork> if I just listen to Gamespot's stream, that doesn't count right?
[21:27] <Tiduz> Magus?
[21:27] <WasabiKing> oh I'd say like 45% of the people in the room said that
[21:27] <Magus> uh sorry ^^'
[21:27] <WasabiKing> and are now on their feed
[21:27] <Rorschach> WTF SPAMMING WII MUSIC SHIT?
[21:27] <Tiduz> lol
[21:27] <Rorschach> OF ALL THE THINGS TO SPAM
[21:27] <Unison_> stealing gamespot's bandwidth is okay
[21:27] <MaddenNFL64> Their stream is good

[21:27] <Tiduz> dont dissapoint me
[21:27] <Sea_Manky> I think I figured out what wii music is for
[21:27] <duckroll> Unison_: can Sony go from -1000 to 1000?
[21:27] <WasabiKing> don't lose your half-ops

[21:27] <Sea_Manky> Nintendo is taking pity on Orin
[21:27] <Unison_> it will take a lot
[21:28] <Amir0x> in GAF STAGE 2
[21:28] <Amir0x> Nintendo fans come together
[21:28] <Sea_Manky> Giving him a game he can play
[21:28] * mdm has joined #GA

[21:29] <Y2Kev> it's IMAGINARY
[21:29] <Amir0x> maybe i'm seeing that wrong
[21:29] <Y2Kev> and one is REAL
[21:29] <BossG> Nintendo didn't do that bad, business wise..which is all that counts...we dont' count
[21:29] <Magus> shouldn't it be -255? :P
[21:29] <Rorschach> 10
[21:29] <Y2Kev> HOW CAN AN IMAGINARY THING BE MORE REAL THAN A REAL THING
[21:29] <Amir0x> but he's saying that guy is WRONG
[21:29] <EGM92> Lone like I said, I wasn't paying attention
[21:29] <Magus> WE ALL KNOW 255 IS THE MAX!
[21:29] <Amir0x> and that a fisher price toy IS better

[21:51] <dcharlie> went on too long
[21:51] <Wario64> resistance 2 is boring

[21:51] <darkh23> back
[21:51] <Sea_Manky> whoa, he grunted when he hit
[21:51] <Wario64> this is lame

[21:52] <FnordChan> Yelling 
[21:52] <Tiduz> It was awesome.

[21:52] <osaka> Tiduz: fanboy
[21:52] <duckroll> very scripted
[21:52] <Tre`> looked so scripted?
[21:52] * Oldschoolgamer has joined #GA
[21:52] <Tre`> IT WAS so scripted
[21:52] <FnordChan> EviLore: Sounds like Saint Seiya.
[21:52] * MrPing1000 is with evilore
[21:52] <Diablos> look, its a 35 year old dressed up like a 15 year old
[21:52] <duckroll> but i have a weak spot for giant monsters
[21:52] <Unison_> true tre`
[21:52] <dcharlie> i loved R1 so i can give them some love
[21:52] <WasabiKing> total scripting
[21:52] <Unison_> lol
[21:52] <Kabouter> It was scripted
[21:52] <Tre`> dude didn't actually shoot anything
[21:52] <Kabouter> But uh
[21:52] <WasabiKing> it has to be
[21:52] <Unison_> i liked R1 pretty well
[21:52] <MrPing1000> pc gamers SCOFF at ye resistance!
[21:52] <Wario64> so resistance 2 is about roof top running
[21:52] <Tre`> what the fuck is that
[21:52] <Kabouter> That was pretty cool though
[21:52] <Rorschach> he shot it
[21:52] <Rorschach> twice!
[21:53] <Y2Kev> Resistance 2: Mirror's Edge
[21:53] <Wario64> when the mouth opened
[21:53] <Wes_> who is saying it wasnt scripted? lol
[21:53] <Sea_Manky> no mouse support, no sale
[21:53] <Unison_> one of the best PS3 games
[21:53] <Wario64> for MASSIVE DAMAGE
[21:53] <MaddenNFL64> Sounds like HAZE
[21:53] <impirius> resistance 2: mirror's ed....dammit y2kev
[21:53] <Diablos> yeah i don't know why there is so much negativity, i thought R2 looked pretty hot
[21:53] <Y2Kev> lol
[21:53] <Amir0x> 60 player multiplayer
[21:53] <Amir0x> *bow*
[21:53] <Diablos> 60 player multi
[21:53] <MaddenNFL64> I mean the description
[21:53] <Tre`> still below Tribes
[21:53] <Diablos> hahaha
[21:53] <Amir0x> Insomniac is the best anything ever
[21:53] <Rorschach> dedicated servers too
[21:53] <Rorschach> :bow
[21:53] <Y2Kev> i still think you have to be pretty jaded not to think that was at least cool looking
[21:53] <Amir0x> i hope it is like RTCW 32 vs 32
[21:53] <LoneWork> Tribes had 10 polygons Tre
[21:53] <Amir0x> Those were the best times
[21:53] <Tiduz> zomfg.
[21:53] <dcharlie> scale scale scale scale
[21:53] <Kabouter> Resistance 2 is in no way as balls out awesome as Gears 2 though
[21:53] <Tre`> Y2Kev:  scripted sequences doesn't do anything for me
[21:53] <Unison_> agree kab
[21:53] <impirius> that looked cool but there didn't seem to be anything to it really
[21:53] <Y2Kev> scripted stuff shows well at press conferences
[21:53] <Unison_> Gears 2 looked better
[21:53] <Rorschach> are they gonna sell bathroom scales too?
[21:53] <bluemax_work> there was no ground texture
[21:53] <Rorschach> what I miss
[21:53] <Tre`> I'm sure
[21:53] <bluemax_work> it was grey fog
[21:53] <bluemax_work> zzz
[21:53] <Sea_Manky> except warhawk
[21:53] <impirius> rors: hahahaha
[21:53] <Tre`> but it's not very exciting
[21:53] <Tre`> to me
[21:54] <OrinX> I TOLD U

[21:56] <Rorschach> [11:55] <@EviLore> amirox fails at having worthwhile opinions  [can't argue with that]
[21:56] <WasabiKing> seriously manky
[21:56] <Amir0x> God of War looks good for PS2, i feel they're not gonna WOW like that on PS3
[21:56] <jett> haters

[21:56] <dcharlie> he has been using it to weigh his donuts
[21:56] <MaddenNFL64> The first things?
[21:56] <osaka> ms: 1 point, sony: -800
[21:56] <MaddenNFL64> Really?
[21:56] <Amir0x> EviLore, do you disagree?
[21:56] <WasabiKing> LBP
[21:56] <pj> fuck lbp
[21:56] <impirius> when historians look back at this time in history, they will probably talk about.... i dunno, the iraq war?
[21:56] <EviLore> LBP incoming
[21:56] <Amir0x> Why the scripted hate?
[21:56] <MrPing1000> why is jack so nervous he's done this shit before
[21:56] <Oldschoolgamer> yes!
[21:56] <Amir0x> What FPS have you been playing?
[21:56] <Diablos> LBP does look pretty neat
[21:56] <BJ55> Sackboooooiiiiii
[21:56] <Tiduz> SURPRISE DEMOS
[21:56] <Tiduz> where?
[21:56] <Tre`> because scripted is BORING
[21:56] <WasabiKing> race car looked cool
[21:56] <Tiduz> Amir0x: Are you gonna get R II ?
[21:56] <MaddenNFL64> They wont be talking about this shit i guarantee
[21:56] <Hitokage> impirius: american idol, duh
[21:56] <Amir0x> Even fucking Stalker is
[21:56] <impirius> oh yeah
[21:56] <Amir0x> scripted
[21:56] <bluemax_work> im so over lbp
[21:56] <Oldschoolgamer> scripted is okay when done in small increments
[21:56] <Amir0x> what isn't
[21:56] <WasabiKing> honestly though
[21:56] <bluemax_work> just like spore
[21:57] <Unison_> i am skeptical of LBP
[21:57] <Tiduz> LBP do want.
[21:57] <bluemax_work> it took too long to come out
[21:57] <Amir0x> That's what I want to know
[21:57] <Tre`> Team Fortress 2, amirox
[21:57] <Unison_> but sony, prove me wrong
[21:57] <WasabiKing> I don't want to see penises all over LBP
[21:57] <EviLore> ami, you're completely missing the point
[21:57] <bluemax_work> and now i dont care
[21:57] <Tre`> and yes
[21:57] <Amir0x> That's a MULTIPLAYER FPS
[21:57] <Tre`> you are missing the point
[21:57] <Amir0x> hello
[21:57] <impirius> Little Big Penis
[21:57] <Tre`> Amirox:  ok
[21:57] <EviLore> it's not that SCRIPTING EXISTS IN THE GAME
[21:57] <bluemax_work> too many buzz words
[21:57] <Tiduz> but if you compare 360 games with pc pc wins too
[21:57] <Sea_Manky> kind of like the tony hawk level editor, the tenchu level editor, the racing destruction set level editor?
[21:57] <Magus> oh god
[21:57] <Magus> they are talking about smiles too :O
[21:57] <Tre`> uniquely playstation
[21:57] <WasabiKing> bluemax: it's management
[21:57] <Unison_> <Jack> Uniquely PlayStation
[21:57] <Magus> SMILES ARE GOING TO RUIN THE GAMING WORLD
[21:57] <Amir0x> it's that...?
[21:57] <Unison_> LOL
[21:57] <WasabiKing> what else you expect
[21:57] <darkh23> CHART TIME
[21:57] <MaddenNFL64> This could be gigantic for Sony though. I don't understand gaming trends today at all anyway.
[21:57] <bluemax_work> zzzz
[21:57] <Y2Kev> oh wow

[23:08] <BJ55> Chunky Morgan
[23:08] <TheDarkShinobi> ms and sony were the ones who needed to fire salvos
[23:08] <MaddenNFL64> Nintendo would have wom if they didnt open their fucking mouths.
[23:08] <WasabiKing> it's all multiplatform
[23:08] * Rorschach makes a video
[23:08] <EviLore> how badly does sony fail when the only exciting thing about the sony conference was their little big planet powerpoint level
[23:09] <Sea_Manky> Wasabi, you should have just removed voice for everyone and let them stew a while. XD

[23:09] <impirius> nintendo lost a lot of points due to the camminator
[23:09] <Amir0x> why the scripted is SO BAD
[23:09] <Unison_> lol
[23:09] <EGM92> 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR

[23:09] <Rorschach> confirmed
[23:09] <MrPing1000> Scripted isn't bad but thats all that trailer was

[23:10] <Amir0x> they don't want to RUIN it
[23:10] <Tre`> he ran through a bunch of corridors between scripted events
[23:10] <impirius> scripted sequences are good and necessary but the ENTIRE THING was scripted
[23:10] * MrPing1000 thinks PC won E3

[23:10] <TheDarkShinobi> dark knight tonight
[23:10] <impirius> MAG and GOW3 (logos) looked awesome
[23:10] <EGM92> ...
[23:10] <jett> i'm not watching any more conferences
[23:10] <Amir0x> Tre: I mean do you want them to go down the entire thing.  I assume you can't really KILL the thing
[23:10] <TheDarkShinobi> fuck e3
[23:10] <MaddenNFL64> But he was the BADASSIEST of giant monster bosses.
[23:10] <jett> i've hadenough
[23:11] <stump> EGM92: they just did a q&a about ffxiii
[23:11] <Amir0x> i assume you're trying to just get away
[23:11] <TheDarkShinobi> *does the Batman boogie*

[23:11] <pj> who is streaming capcom and ubi
[23:11] * MrPing1000 offers #ga a group hug as we all cry
[23:11] <jett> imp: actually the MAG logo is pretty horrible
[23:11] <BJ55> lol @ this guy on CAG forums with an EIGHT MEGABYTE gif in his sig
[23:11] <stump> pj: just g4
[23:11] <Unison_> PS2 price increase was funny
[23:11] <Tre`> I want them to actually do SOMETHING
[23:11] <WasabiKing> I'm sure that's not the final logo
[23:11] <pj> ic
[23:11] * fdasfdas is now known as poop_tea
[23:11] <EviLore> ami: every fps uses scripted elements, yes, but that sequence didn't have any real player involvement at all.  you watch the monster, you run up the building and down the buiding, the monster grabs you, you shoot it once, he throws you down, you follow the one path.  and you brought up STALKER?  really?
[23:11] <Tre`> it doesn't even have to be that sequence
[23:11] <TheDarkShinobi> wait, wha?
[23:11] <TheDarkShinobi> ps2 price increase?
[23:11] <impirius> jett: they were just going for something as generic as the title
[23:11] <Tre`> wait
[23:11] <Tre`> you actually brought up stalker?
[23:11] <Amir0x> EviLore: As an example of a FPS you like that has scripted elements
[23:11] <Tre`> Ami?
[23:11] <OrinX> * WasabiKing sets mode: -m
[23:11] <soakrates> which game are we talking about
[23:11] <Tre`> I didn't see that shit
[23:11] <Amir0x> that's why I mentioned Stalker
[23:11] <Tre`> get the fuck out
[23:11] <Unison_> yeah, they are making a $149 Lego Batman Bundle
[23:11] <OrinX> I dont have to voice anymore rite

[23:11] <Tre`> I'm not even bothering with this shit
[23:11] <soakrates> or..which game are Tre and Ami talking about
[23:11] <BlueTsunami> wowo Sony didn't even enounced any RPGs
[23:11] <TheDarkShinobi> haha
[23:11] <MaddenNFL64> $199 bundle. BUT BATMAN LEGO. and a movie
[23:11] <TEEEPO> oh wow
[23:11] <Diablos> PS3: One SKU future
[23:12] * jakershaker has quit IRC (Quit: )
[23:12] <TheDarkShinobi> shows you how dead the rpg scene is now
[23:12] <Diablos> I do respect that
[23:12] <Unison_> i like the Size Matters pack for "families"
[23:12] <TEEEPO> pop's e3 trailer uses sigur ros
[23:12] <Unison_> haha
[23:12] <Tre`> I was giving you the benefit of the doubt until I read STALKER.
[23:12] <MaddenNFL64> oh wait the 199 was the psp
[23:12] <MrPing1000> who would have thought that the 360 would become the jrpg platform
[23:12] <WasabiKing> downgraded
[23:12] <MaddenNFL64> lol
[23:12] <WasabiKing> lol
[23:12] <TEEEPO> another new bands for nerds to gawk at
[23:12] <SnakeXs> Soakrates: R2
[23:12] <Diablos> TheDarkShinobi: Huh? No, they all went to DS and 360
[23:12] <LoneWork> PS3 up to 82nd SKU
[23:12] <soakrates> ah
[23:12] <Y2Kev> EA had the best conference
[23:12] <TheDarkShinobi> lol
[23:12] <impirius> i like their strategy for keeping PS2 sales up by eliminating all BC
[23:12] <Amir0x> Tre, i am not saying RESISTANCE IS STALKER
[23:12] <Unison_> MS clearly won haha
[23:12] <SnakeXs> Tre says it's console scripted shit, Ami says it's amazing.
[23:12] <Amir0x> i am saying it has scripted elements
[23:12] <Amir0x> and at the time
[23:12] <soakrates> give me a conference at E3
[23:12] <Tre`> Semi-sandbox game vs. Corridor-ScriptSequence-Deluxe 2
[23:12] <soakrates> it will be awesome
[23:12] <Rorschach> Y2Kev: yup
[23:12] <Amir0x> you were making it seem like
[23:12] <soakrates> Dio will play
[23:12] <Amir0x> SCRIPTED IS BAD
[23:12] <OrinX> sony started out so awesome...
[23:12] <Rorschach> EA = conference of the week
[23:12] * stump has left #GA
[23:12] <Amir0x> Which is what it sounded like
[23:12] <TheDarkShinobi> it's funny...without ff13 ms might not look much better then sony or nintendo
[23:12] <Tre`> Yes amir0x, because that's ALL THEY SHOWED
[23:12] <Rorschach> big 3 = shit
[23:12] <soakrates> and there will be fireworks
[23:12] <Tre`> was one big scripted sequence
[23:12] <Unison_> true shin
[23:12] <MaddenNFL64> EA had the best conf. Id agree with that. Heres Bioware. Heres valve. Heres Id.
[23:12] <Tre`> there was no gameplay
[23:12] <Sea_Manky> Sony deserves all the shit they get just for forgetting WHY the PSX to PSX2 transition worked so damn well
[23:12] <TheDarkShinobi> but the ff13 bombshell at the end gave 'em all sorts of extra points
[23:12] <MaddenNFL64> Superstarrs
[23:12] <Tre`> there wasn't evena  point to have the guy controlling it
[23:12] <jett> it's sad but microsoft that the "best" conference
[23:12] <Diablos> TheDarkShinobi: I'd argue Sony had better games than MS, it's just that MS dropped a huge fucking bomb
[23:12] <soakrates> Capcom has a conference?
[23:12] <WasabiKing> really bad E3
[23:13] <LoneWork> without FFXIII, sony wins
[23:13] <soakrates> I'll watch that
[23:13] <WasabiKing> this is the dagger
[23:13] <Amir0x> Tre: Ok, let me try to put this another way
[23:13] * syllogism has joined #GA
[23:13] <Amir0x> in the discussion we were having
[23:13] <Unison_> i dont think anyone really wins here
[23:13] <Amir0x> the ONLY thing i got out of it was
[23:13] <Diablos> MS allowed their conference to suck ass and let Wada hijack it at the end
[23:13] <Amir0x> EviLore and you dislike scripted
[23:13] <Amir0x> not
[23:13] <Unison_> all of them were lousy
[23:13] <Tre`> That's got nothing to do with me
[23:13] <TEEEPO> hey guys, i enjoyed the too human demo :(
[23:13] <MaddenNFL64> I'd say so. but wouldnt be much of a win. FF13 made this years E3.
[23:13] <Amir0x> I hate that theyr'e just showing this scripted scene
[23:13] <Diablos> the ENTIRE conference sucked except FF123
[23:13] <Diablos> 13 even
[23:13] <TheDarkShinobi> game wise I don't see much from any of em that's keeping me awake
[23:13] <impirius> microsoft had the least bad conference in aggregate
[23:13] <SnakeXs> TEEPO GET DOWN, RUN
[23:13] * jett is now known as jett\generation_of_fail
[23:13] <Diablos> Sony on the other hand had four good games to show off, but the flow/presentation sucked
[23:13] <jaask> street fighter 4 trailer
[23:13] <milhouse3> gaf is broken
[23:13] <TheDarkShinobi> hell, I agree with dm
[23:13] <jaask> half of it 
[23:13] <TheDarkShinobi> ea won e3
[23:13] <jaask> http://www.gamersyde.com/news_6800_en.html
[23:13] <TheDarkShinobi> fifa 09 ftw
[23:13] <Tre`> EA actually did win EA
[23:13] <Tre`> er
[23:13] <Tre`> E3
[23:13] <syllogism> ms conference was awful
[23:13] <soakrates> jaask: is that the anime one

[23:13] * errorGAIDEN2 has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[23:13] <Y2Kev> EA > all this year
[23:14] <LoneWork> EA didn't give a shit about E3
[23:14] <impirius> i thought the ratchet episode for $15 was a great announcement
[23:14] <jaask> soakrates gameplay
[23:14] <MaddenNFL64> EA wins all the time. They own it.
[23:14] <LoneWork> they were too busy selling tons of NCAA 09
[23:14] <impirius> didn't expect ratchet at all
[23:14] <TheDarkShinobi> ms presentation was cheesey as fuck

[23:14] <TheDarkShinobi> then again, tretton's presentation sounded like he was speaking at a funeral
[23:14] <Tre`> MS had the FF13 fuck you bomb, though
[23:14] * pj is now known as E3sucks
[23:14] <soakrates> when's the Capcom conference
[23:14] <Tre`> which spawned such classic lines as BLU-RAY 3
[23:14] <MaddenNFL64> Jack sounded pissed.
[23:14] <BossG> roxy does it every time

[23:14] * ZombieSupaStar has joined #GA

[23:14] <TheDarkShinobi> "Oh hey, I almost forgot...Sony, fuck you!!"
[23:14] <Tre`> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfmZHY59psY -- This is why MS won
[23:14] <TheDarkShinobi> very effective
[23:14] <vicalpha> EA won E3
[23:15] <Diablos> nobody won e3
[23:15] <Amir0x> Wada did
[23:15] <Tre`> MY NIGHTMARE CAME ALIVE
[23:15] <Amir0x> we established that
[23:15] <MaddenNFL64> Wada did. yep
[23:15] <milhouse3> ryu shouldn't talk NOOOOOOOOOOO
[23:15] <MaddenNFL64> Classic moment
[23:15] <jett\generation_of_fail> Wada won E3
[23:15] <SnakeXs> They had a summit or something.
[23:15] <Oldschoolgamer> wow
[23:15] <jett\generation_of_fail> wada is a pimp

[23:16] <SnakeXs> Wtf baby dick.
[23:16] <Acosta> that is an improvement over nintendo and ms
[23:16] <Diablos> WHY DO DO THAT TO USSSSSSSSSSSS
[23:16] <impirius> nintendo was so disappointing.  they mentioned that they'd have 3 games for 'core gamers' or whatever
[23:16] <impirius> not sure why i expected anything
[23:16] <MaddenNFL64> Nintendo. Trainwreck. Sony. Average. MS.Average then, WADATON.
[23:17] <soakrates> "I think it was like a summit or something"
[23:17] <FnordChan> impirius:  They're referring to individual games that are part of Game Center CX for the DS.
[23:17] <darkh23> so...wait for spaceworld?
[23:17] <impirius> MS was fairly shit until FF13.  Urine the Movies!
[23:17] <FnordChan> darkh23:  Yes.  And then keep waiting.
[23:17] <jett\generation_of_fail> madden got it right
[23:17] <Amir0x> Sony was not average

[23:17] <Amir0x> but that's all they had
[23:17] <Y2Kev> MS: starts good, then completely horrible until FFXIII

[23:17] <Tre`> Nintendo killed it
[23:17] <Y2Kev> nintendo: unabashedly horrible
[23:17] <darkh23> I dunno....I came for the LOLZ...and nintendo delievered
[23:17] <Tre`> then nintendo RE-killed it

[23:18] <TheDarkShinobi> e3 during non-renew hardware years = SHIT
[23:18] <soakrates> console gaming's dead
[23:18] <Diablos> Sony's problem was that theirs was TOO LONG
[23:18] <Amir0x> To me it is
[23:18] <Diablos> if they just focused on the four big games
[23:18] <soakrates> PC gaming's dead
[23:18] <impirius> so will this be better or worse than E3 2006 in terms of GIFs?

Ratchet and Clank Future: Quest for Booty, MAG, DC Universe Online, inFamous, Resistance 2, Resistance: Liberation, God of War III, and HOME living spaces. Not to mention the video store that will go up tonight. Seriously, Sony shit all over Nintendo and Microsoft. One criticis

[23:26] <jett\generation_of_fail> THE WADA is the new video game pimp
[23:26] <Diablos> bish_GroveSt: Absolutely nothing.
[23:26] <FnordChan> BossG:  More like A for business, could care less about the hardcore, all involved in the presentation to spend the year wallowing in giant piles of money.
[23:26] <jett\generation_of_fail> all hail THE WADA
[23:26] <Dragona> Thank god for PSP and DS
[23:26] <Dragona> that's all I have to say

[23:27] <Acosta> I am ready to see the E3 sinks
[23:27] <bish_GroveSt> Sony did nothing? I'm not wading through 18 pages of god knows what
[23:27] <Diablos> Well
[23:27] <Diablos> Ok
[23:27] <Diablos> sony had Resistance, LBP, God of War 3, Infamous
[23:27] <Diablos> But the problem was
[23:27] <Diablos> it was too goddamn long
[23:27] <Diablos> they used up SO MUCH TIME
[23:27] * PimpbaaBJforVoice is now known as Pimpbaa
[23:27] * Pimpbaa has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[23:27] <Diablos> i.e. STREAMING MOVIES ON PSN IS NEXT-GEN
[23:27] <impirius> sony will have a short ratchet & clank game for $15 this year
[23:28] <Diablos> oh and you can download full length movies now, but only in standard def
[23:28] <Diablos> don't wanna kill blu ray
[23:28] <Diablos> lol
[23:28] <TEEEPO> sony's used cg for the two new games they announced
[23:28] <impirius> and they have a movie store ala xbox live
[23:28] <Amir0x> the actual problem was hubris
[23:28] <Dragona> There's an HD version available too Diablos
[23:28] <Diablos> good
[23:28] <TEEEPO> http://www.gametrailers.com/player/36281.html?type=
[23:28] <Amir0x> they had fucking DEVELOPER TESTIMONIALS
[23:28] <Amir0x> seriously
[23:28] <Diablos> i thought it was sd only
[23:28] <impirius> you can rent HD movies
[23:28] <TEEEPO> OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG
[23:28] <Diablos> oh yeah developers sucking ps3 cock
[23:28] <Acosta> yes hd is avaliable too
[23:28] <impirius> for fucking $6
[23:28] <Diablos> that too
[23:28] <BossG> yeah, that was the highlight of the sony presentation, the QUEST FOR BOOTY
[23:28] <Amir0x> DEVELOPER TESTIMONIALS are for BEFORE a system launches
[23:28] <MaddenNFL64> cant buy HD movies?
[23:28] <Rorschach> In short: there's no reason to buy a ps3 in the year of ps3 unless you want to have BC because they are taking that out in the fall
[23:28] <Amir0x> not two years in
[23:28] <BJ55> Best news = Super Stardust Portable
[23:28] <MaddenNFL64> Still, better then XBL if you can buy.
[23:28] <impirius> you have to use 2 PSPs to have enough sticks to play SSHD
[23:28] <Rorschach> oh and one other reason to own a ps3...MADDEN LEAGUE! even though madden ps3 isn't real
[23:29] <bish_GroveSt> ...
[23:29] <Dragona> glad I have a 60GB
[23:29] <TEEEPO> MIRROR'S EDGE is the greatest game i've ever seen
[23:29] <impirius> <3 60GB <3
[23:29] <Rorschach> 80 gigs will not have BC anymore
[23:29] <BlueTsunami> Man I can't believe WiiMusic was hyped with the 1:1 controls
[23:29] * BlueTsunami rolling
[23:29] <Rorschach> and they will be 399
[23:29] <Diablos> sony is killing backwards compatibility it seems
[23:29] <Diablos> lol
[23:29] <impirius> wiimusic doesn't use the 1:1 does it?
[23:29] <Rorschach> nope
[23:29] <BossG> hehe, I'm sure you're glad you payed a premium price for that 60gb
[23:29] <Dragona> lolz no
[23:30] <impirius> wii sports resort isn't until next year
[23:30] <MaddenNFL64> doesnt even look like it uses 1"1
[23:30] <soakrates> lol @ 1:1
[23:30] <soakrates> that to me was the funniest thing from the Nintendo conference
[23:30] <impirius> Wii Music uses seizure:1
[23:30] <Rorschach> only that stupid wii sports game taht doesn't even need it has it
[23:30] <BlueTsunami> *The ninfans I mean, they all stated how the 1:1 adapter will come with WiiMusi
[23:30] <MaddenNFL64> And that thing must be a damn gryoscope.
[23:30] <soakrates> Nintendo milks its fanbase better than any other company
[23:30] <BossG> better than Apple?
[23:30] <BossG> hehe
[23:30] <Rorschach> remember the revolution days when people were banned for predicting "gyroscopez!"
[23:31] <soakrates> they are just pure fucking evil
[23:31] <soakrates> BossG: ok, better than any other game company or whatever
[23:31] * jakehk has joined #GA
[23:31] <Rorschach> soakrates: better than activision?
[23:31] <Rorschach> with their damn guitar hero games

[23:32] <MaddenNFL64> Did they say their going to sell larger Wii condoms or theyre packaged with the gyroscope?
[23:32] * syllogism has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[23:32] <Rorschach> packaged
[23:32] <BossG> that's plus the game, and controlle..

[23:32] <BlueTsunami> Replacing the speed racer GIF
[23:32] <soakrates> a SHITLOAD of people bought it
[23:32] <BlueTsunami> Good lord
[23:33] <Rorschach> Ravi-czaf
[23:33] <MaddenNFL64> Nintendo knows how to nickel & dime thats for sure.
[23:33] <soakrates> then they release the GBA again with backlighting
[23:33] <soakrates> and sells a shitload more
[23:33] * lolscammed has quit IRC (Quit: )
[23:33] <WasabiKing> loldrums was already running in the background
[23:33] <EviLore> little big planet is pretty much the only interesting retail ps3 game for the rest of the year.  they have some neat PSN stuff at least..................
[23:33] <BossG> yeah, nintendo saves every penny they can get
[23:33] <MaddenNFL64> But I just bought all 3 costume packs for NG2, so i'm a sucker.
[23:33] <EviLore> where the hell was wipeout hd
[23:33] <soakrates> then they release the DS
[23:33] <EviLore> and thrICO
[23:33] <soakrates> then shortly after a shitload of people buy it
[23:33] <Rorschach> oh yeah forgot about LBP
[23:33] <soakrates> release it again
[23:33] <Acosta> team ico will be at tgs at best
[23:33] <Rorschach> only reason to pick up a ps3 this year
[23:33] <MaddenNFL64> 2 of the packs suck balls. Ryu with a big eyeball helmet. wtf.
[23:33] <Acosta> a private room, just like shadow of the colossus
[23:33] <soakrates> and NOW they're selling a controller in three fucking parts!
[23:34] <Rorschach> next year is the year of sony for realz
[23:34] <Sea_Manky> hahahaha
[23:34] <SnakeXs> No Ueda = Sony instantly failed E3.
[23:34] <soakrates> Nintendo has no shame
[23:34] <BossG> and no mercy...
[23:34] <Sea_Manky> I was just showing my wife that loldrums gif, and explained about wii music and how there's really no way to lose, and she sez, "I dunno, looking at that gif I think we have a loser." XD
[23:34] <BossG> and the hardcore seems to lap it up...like they want to get fucked
[23:34] <MaddenNFL64> Someone needs to kidnap Iwata & force his ass to bundle shit properly. This needs to be in every Wii box.
[23:35] <FnordChan> Sea_Manky:  Your wife speaks truth.
[23:35] <BossG> so don't hesitate, and give them the hard dick they crave
[23:35] <MaddenNFL64> Not just Wii Summer fun or whatever

[23:48] <Acosta> I liked the scene of esistance
[23:48] <Rorschach> pfft you don't get banned for being racist or there would be a lot of bannings
[23:48] <MrPing1000> I'm a mechanical I'm a mechanical I'm a mechanical man
[23:48] <Acosta> Tre` is right however, it was scripted
[23:48] <TheDarkShinobi> seriously
[23:48] <Acosta> not a real fight
[23:48] <Amir0x> From PR duckroll: Exclusive titles that will only be found on the PS3 system this holiday season
[23:48] <Amir0x> include Valkyria Chronicles(TM)
[23:48] <WasabiKing> Orin_Not_Racist_Not
[23:48] <MaddenNFL64> He was just quoting the yt clip. Which is pretty damn funny.
[23:48] <Acosta> is not even like gow 2, at least that was still a combat
[23:48] <Ed> really roschach? then I can start my hateful web agenda of blue people
[23:49] <Acosta> in that scene you just run
[23:49] <WasabiKing> Orin_Not_Not_Racist
[23:49] <Ed> fuck skeeter
[23:49] <Tiduz\\`> Even if it was scripted
[23:49] <Rorschach> skeeter was black
[23:49] <Tiduz\\`> im still impressed
[23:49] <TheDarkShinobi> was Final Fantasy 13 crossed out on that PR list?
[23:49] <Rorschach> all blue people on that show were black
[23:49] <Tiduz\\`> also wtf at no ff13 lol
[23:49] <WasabiKing> for this holioday season
[23:49] <Tiduz\\`> at ps3 e3
[23:49] <Tiduz\\`> TGS maybe?
[23:49] <MaddenNFL64> Honk Honk
[23:49] * Orin_Not_Racist slaps Ed around a bit with a large trout
[23:49] <WasabiKing> not 2011
[23:49] <TEEEPO> i wonder when sega is going to port valk and yakuza over to the 360
[23:49] <Tiduz\\`> lol WasabiKing
[23:49] <Acosta> where the hell is white knight
[23:49] <Tiduz\\`> good point
[23:49] <Acosta> :(
[23:49] <Tiduz\\`> Acosta: TGA
[23:49] <Rorschach> no showing of betraylton game ever
[23:49] <TEEEPO> tgs acosta
[23:49] <Tiduz\\`> RgS*
[23:49] <Tiduz\\`> GODDAMNIT
[23:49] <Tiduz\\`> TGS*
[23:49] <TEEEPO> you fail tiduz
[23:49] <Ed> when obama is elected king orinx will be first against the wall
[23:50] <Rorschach> betrayalton13
[23:50] <MrPing1000> someone turn off OT so gaf works
[23:50] <MaddenNFL64> Ya lol they didn't show betrayal 13
[23:50] <Acosta> yeah, I imagine
[23:50] <WasabiKing> they probably cut them out during yesterday's 12 hour rehearsal
[23:50] * Dragona has left #GA
[23:50] <TEEEPO> i wonder if ff13 for the 360 even exisits at this point
[23:50] <Rorschach> it doesn't yet
[23:50] <Acosta> no
[23:51] <Rorschach> they said they were going to finish making it on pc, then ps3 for japan, then work on the US ports
[23:51] <MaddenNFL64> Nah. It will though. WHich means we won't see it till late next year.
[23:51] <Tiduz\\`> http://images.gamersyde.com/gallery/public/8952/1524_0004.jpg
[23:51] <Acosta> I am going to import and play it in japanese
[23:51] <TEEEPO> whoa
[23:51] <MaddenNFL64> I mean FF13 on any platform.
[23:51] <TEEEPO> thats one ugly model
[23:51] <Acosta> if I have to wait they localize it and port to 360
[23:51] <Rorschach> so US FFXIII delayed for ps3 users because of 360 port lolz
[23:51] <Acosta> i could die waiting
[23:51] <TEEEPO> if bluedragon was say... 5 dvds
[23:51] <TEEEPO> wait 3
[23:51] <Tiduz\\`> oo new naruto trailer
[23:51] <TEEEPO> how many will 13 have
[23:52] <Acosta> 4 or 5 cds
[23:52] <WasabiKing> so what's the real story of loldrums
[23:52] <WasabiKing> who's the dude behind it
[23:52] <Tiduz\\`> WasabiKing: RAVI DRUMS
[23:52] <WasabiKing> with the awful fro
[23:52] <Tiduz\\`> Thats his name.
[23:52] <Rorschach> WasabiKing: ravi
[23:52] <Rorschach> dm's cousin
[23:52] <WasabiKing> I mean mohawk
[23:52] <WasabiKing> lol
[23:52] <WasabiKing> no for real rors
[23:52] <Acosta> with an option to install
[23:52] <Tiduz\\`> You should have seen him in action
[23:52] <Rorschach> it's some guy they hired who used to drum for whatsherface from american idol
[23:52] <Tiduz\\`> He has drummed for Paula Abdul according to someone
[23:52] <Tiduz\\`> lollol
[23:52] <Rorschach> to play fake drums for the show
[23:52] <WasabiKing> lol
[23:53] <WasabiKing> you're in LA
[23:53] <Rorschach> but he's not really playing
[23:53] <WasabiKing> hire a real drummer
[23:53] <MaddenNFL64> to play fake drums like a dumbass
[23:53] <WasabiKing> lol, 1 to 1 my ass
[23:53] <BossG> heh...and those beats were wack
[23:53] <Rorschach> that game doesn't have 1:1
[23:53] <Rorschach> only wii sports: resort
[23:53] <MaddenNFL64> And Miyamoto. Well he was playing a a pretend flute to pretend note in pretend land.
[23:53] <WasabiKing> drummed for paula abdul
[23:54] <WasabiKing> lol
[23:54] <WasabiKing> only good beat maybe was straight up
[23:54] <WasabiKing> MAYBE
[23:54] <Ed> it plays a midi
[23:54] <Ed> hahahah
[23:54] <Ed> they should have camptown races
[23:54] <WasabiKing> all he had to play was the zelda flute song
[23:54] <MaddenNFL64> ya Wii Music doesnt use 1:1
[23:54] <WasabiKing> and everyone would be saying
[23:54] <WasabiKing> BEST GAME EVER
[23:54] <MaddenNFL64> Which is dumb as hell
[23:54] <MrPing1000> it's amusing that the water in wii sports 2 is worse looking than the water in the gamecube waverace. Nintendo is lazy and they're rolling in it
[23:54] <WasabiKing> and bust a nut
[23:55] <WasabiKing> wii watersports?
[23:55] <WasabiKing> that doesn't sound appealing
[23:55] <Ed> HAHAH
[23:55] <Amir0x> i should buy Animal Crossing City Folk and leave voice messages scaring the little children away
[23:55] <Rorschach> WasabiKing: here's the catch, though...you don't have to actually play the instruments like in rockband...it just plays a song file and you pretend you're playing and it adds notes 
[23:55] <WasabiKing> lol
[23:55] <WasabiKing> for fuck's sakes
[23:55] <Ed> I think Nintendo has a secret agenda to put in subtle sexual terms in all of their products
[23:55] <Acosta> Ubi conference
[23:55] <WasabiKing> see Unison, ALL YOUR FAULT
[23:55] <Rorschach> so by moving around like you have a flute in your hand, you play the sax
[23:55] <Rorschach> but you don't have to push buttons
[23:55] <Acosta> I'm kinda curious about PoP and I am alive
[23:56] <Ed> maybe Wii is successful because of some Freud complex.
[23:56] <BossG> I'd let it pass if they pretended to play some funk music, but no...just that wack ass shit
[23:56] <MaddenNFL64> If he played the Wii flute and it was orchestrated Zelda music... I might like Wii music. I'm that easy to win over.
[23:56] * stump has joined #GA
[23:56] <WasabiKing> lol not even that Boss
[23:56] <Ed> Think about, maybe the Wii is popular with the women because of that subconcious penis envy
[23:56] <MrPing1000> ubisoft better announce red steel 2 with 1:1 motion swordplay, or they better at least have it in the works
[23:56] <impirius> animal crossing wii would make sense as a wiiware game
[23:56] <stump> http://games.stumpnet.net/Kirby_Package.jpg <-- Kirby is finally happy on a north american box art
[23:56] <Rorschach> if miyamoto came out rapping, I'd buy 20 copies
[23:56] <Rorschach> but noooooooo
[23:56] <WasabiKing> ubisoft too busy trying to be like EA
[23:57] <Ed> Why wouldn't Kirby be happy?
[23:57] <Acosta> smiles
[23:57] <Ed> Super Star Ultra Deluxe!
[23:57] <stump> Ed: have you ever seen a north american kirby box art!?
[23:57] <Ed> nah I know
[23:57] <BossG> kirby's ass looks like his face...ofcourse he's happy :)
[23:57] <Rorschach> they always add an angry face to kirby
[23:57] <Tiduz\\`> 80GB "Core" PS3 for $399 in September, No Backwards Compatibility
[23:57] <Tiduz\\`> is this good compared to 40 gb?
[23:57] <Amir0x> so
[23:57] <Tiduz\\`> what did 40 gb cost
[23:57] <Amir0x> it is kind of weird though
[23:57] <Rorschach> same
[23:57] <BossG> 399$
[23:57] <MaddenNFL64> Kirby American version. I love tha guy. He's pissed off cuz he's a hero.
[23:58] <Rorschach> 40 gig was 399
[23:58] <Amir0x> we went into E3 thinking Nintendo needed to show its Fall/Winter lineup
[23:58] <stump> Tiduz: they upgraded the 40gb to 80gb and then killed the old 80gb
[23:58] <Amir0x> and they still basically haven't
[23:58] <Tiduz\\`> nice i guess
[23:58] <Tiduz\\`> so bc is gone
[23:58] <Rorschach> not nice
[23:58] <osaka> so
[23:58] <Rorschach> bc gone
[23:58] <Amir0x> They only have Animal Crossing and Wii Music?
[23:58] <osaka> who won E3?
[23:58] <Amir0x> I dunno
[23:58] <Rorschach> MS
[23:58] <Tiduz\\`> 40 gig didnt have bc either
[23:58] <WasabiKing> no one
[23:58] <Amir0x> maybe TGS will have more
[23:58] <Acosta> Wada
[23:58] <Tiduz\\`> 80 gig had it?
[23:58] <LoneWork> I still have BC, YOU LOSERS
[23:58] <WasabiKing> everyone lost
[23:58] <stump> Amir0x: fall is Wario, AC, and Wii Music.
[23:58] <Rorschach> 80 gig had BC
[23:58] <stump> Amir0x: winter is an open boo
[23:58] <Amir0x> Wario
[23:58] <stump> k
[23:58] <Tiduz\\`> i have a 60gb launch unit
[23:58] <Amir0x> i forgot about Wario
[23:58] <Acosta> Square Enix stocks went up even
[23:58] <Tiduz\\`> but im pal, so if my ps3 breaks im screwed
[23:58] <Amir0x> ok i guess i'll take my bone
[23:58] <stump> I suspect we'll get fatal frame
[23:58] <Rorschach> 20, 60, 80 had 40 does not
[23:58] <Rorschach> 80 won't after september
[23:59] <Ed> they should just produce more wii fits
[23:59] <Acosta> this generation is so fucked with skus
[23:59] <Ed> that would be a good fall and winter lineup
[23:59] <Rorschach> yes
[23:59] <Acosta> is really annoying
[23:59] <Ed> "You have a 10% increased chance of buying Wii Fit!"
[23:59] <TheDarkShinobi> coming soon - 100gig model!!
[23:59] <Ed> "BEST E3 EVER"
